    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2094D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou have two drums in front of you: a left drum and a right drum. A hit on the left can be recorded as \"L\", and a hit on the right as \"R\".\n\nThe strange forces that rule this world are fickle: sometimes, a blow sounds once, and sometimes it sounds twice. Therefore, a hit on the left drum could have sounded as either \"L\" or \"LL\", and a hit on the right drum could have sounded as either \"R\" or \"RR\".\n\nThe sequence of hits made is recorded in the string $p$, and the sounds heard are in the string $s$. Given $p$ and $s$, determine whether it is true that the string $s$ could have been the result of the hits from the string $p$.\n\nFor example, if $p=$\"LR\", then the result of the hits could be any of the strings \"LR\", \"LRR\", \"LLR\", and \"LLRR\", but the strings \"LLLR\" or \"LRL\" cannot.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$)Â -- the number of independent test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the string $p$ ($1 \\le |p| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) consisting only of the characters \"R\" and \"L\", where $|p|$ denotes the length of the string $p$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $s$ ($1 \\le |p| \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) consisting only of the characters \"R\" and \"L\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$ across all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each set of input data, output \"YES\" if $s$ can be the heard sound, and \"NO\" otherwise. You may output in any case.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\nR\n\nRR\n\nLRLR\n\nLRLR\n\nLR\n\nLLLR\n\nLLLLLRL\n\nLLLLRRLL\n\nLLRLRLRRL\n\nLLLRLRRLLRRRL\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n```",
