    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1992E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOne of the first programming problems by K1o0n looked like this: \"Noobish\\_Monk has $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 100)$ friends. Each of them gave him $a$ $(1 \\le a \\le 10000)$ apples for his birthday. Delighted with such a gift, Noobish\\_Monk returned $b$ $(1 \\le b \\le \\min(10000, a \\cdot n))$ apples to his friends. How many apples are left with Noobish\\_Monk?\"\n\nK1o0n wrote a solution, but accidentally considered the value of $n$ as a string, so the value of $n \\cdot a - b$ was calculated differently. Specifically:\n\n- when multiplying the string $n$ by the integer $a$, he will get the string $s=\\underbrace{n + n + \\dots + n + n}_{a\\ \\text{times}}$\n- when subtracting the integer $b$ from the string $s$, the last $b$ characters will be removed from it. If $b$ is greater than or equal to the length of the string $s$, it will become empty.\n\nLearning about this, ErnKor became interested in how many pairs $(a, b)$ exist for a given $n$, satisfying the constraints of the problem, on which K1o0n's solution gives the correct answer.\n\n\"The solution gives the correct answer\" means that it outputs a non-empty string, and this string, when converted to an integer, equals the correct answer, i.e., the value of $n \\cdot a - b$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)  -- the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, a single line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that in all test cases, $n$ is distinct.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the answer in the following format:\n\nIn the first line, output the integer $x$ -- the number of bad tests for the given $n$.\n\nIn the next $x$ lines, output two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ -- such integers that K1o0n's solution on the test \"$n$ $a_i$ $b_i$\" gives the correct answer.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n20 18\n219 216\n2218 2214\n1\n165 162\n1\n1262 2519\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, $a = 20$, $b = 18$ are suitable, as \"$\\text{2}$\" $\\cdot 20 - 18 =$ \"$\\text{22222222222222222222}$\"$- 18 = 22 = 2 \\cdot 20 - 18$",
