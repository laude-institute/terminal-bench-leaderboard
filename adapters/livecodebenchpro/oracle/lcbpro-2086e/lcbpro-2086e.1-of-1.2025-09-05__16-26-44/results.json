    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2086E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nWe call a positive integer zebra-like if its binary representation has alternating bits up to the most significant bit, and the least significant bit is equal to $1$. For example, the numbers $1$, $5$, and $21$ are zebra-like, as their binary representations $1$, $101$, and $10101$ meet the requirements, while the number $10$ is not zebra-like, as the least significant bit of its binary representation $1010$ is $0$.\n\nWe define the zebra value of a positive integer $e$ as the minimum integer $p$ such that $e$ can be expressed as the sum of $p$ zebra-like numbers (possibly the same, possibly different)\n\nGiven three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$, calculate the number of integers $x$ such that $l \\le x \\le r$ and the zebra value of $x$ equals $k$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) -- the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers $l$, $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^{18}$) and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the number of integers in $[l, r]$ with zebra value $k$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 100 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n15 77 2\n\n2 10 100\n\n1234567 123456789101112131 12\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n13\n1\n3\n0\n4246658701\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are $13$ suitable numbers: $3, 7, 11, 15, 23, 27, 31, 43, 47, 63, 87, 91, 95$.\n\nEach of them can be represented as a sum of $3$ zebra-like numbers.",
