    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2020A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given two integers $n$ and $k$.\n\nIn one operation, you can subtract any power of $k$ from $n$. Formally, in one operation, you can replace $n$ by $(n-k^x)$ for any non-negative integer $x$.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make $n$ equal to $0$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 10^9$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations on a new line.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n5 2\n\n3 5\n\n16 4\n\n100 3\n\n6492 10\n\n10 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n3\n1\n4\n21\n10\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $n = 5$ and $k = 2$. We can perform the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. Subtract $2^0 = 1$ from $5$. The current value of $n$ becomes $5 - 1 = 4$.\n2. Subtract $2^2 = 4$ from $4$. The current value of $n$ becomes $4 - 4 = 0$.\n\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make $n$ equal to $0$ in less than $2$ operations. Thus, $2$ is the answer.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 3$ and $k = 5$. We can perform the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. Subtract $5^0 = 1$ from $3$. The current value of $n$ becomes $3 - 1 = 2$.\n2. Subtract $5^0 = 1$ from $2$. The current value of $n$ becomes $2 - 1 = 1$.\n3. Subtract $5^0 = 1$ from $1$. The current value of $n$ becomes $1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make $n$ equal to $0$ in less than $3$ operations. Thus, $3$ is the answer.",
