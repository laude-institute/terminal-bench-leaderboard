    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2064E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSteve has a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ and an array $c$, both of length $n$. Steve wishes to sort the permutation $p$.\n\nSteve has an infinite supply of coloured sand blocks, and using them he discovered a physics-based way to sort an array of numbers called gravity sort. Namely, to perform gravity sort on $p$, Steve will do the following:\n\n- For all $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le n$, place a sand block of color $c_i$ in position $(i, j)$ for all $j$ where $1 \\le j \\le p_i$. Here, position $(x, y)$ denotes a cell in the $x$-th row from the top and $y$-th column from the left.\n- Apply downwards gravity to the array, so that all sand blocks fall as long as they can fall.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/bc9da7db75c1cd76ae4b448579a882a11a989364.png)An example of gravity sort for the third testcase. $p = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]$, $c = [2, 1, 4, 1, 5]$\n\nAlex looks at Steve's sand blocks after performing gravity sort and wonders how many pairs of arrays $(p',c')$ where $p'$ is a permutation would have resulted in the same layout of sand. Note that the original pair of arrays $(p, c)$ will always be counted.\n\nPlease calculate this for Alex. As this number could be large, output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is a $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the lengths of the arrays.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains $n$ distinct integers $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$) -- the elements of $p$.\n\nThe following line contains $n$ integers $c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n$) -- the elements of $c$.\n\nThe sum of $n$ across all testcases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each testcase, output the number of pairs of arrays $(p', c')$ Steve could have started with, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n5 3 4 1 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n5\n\n4 2 3 1 5\n\n2 1 4 1 5\n\n40\n\n29 15 20 35 37 31 27 1 32 36 38 25 22 8 16 7 3 28 11 12 23 4 14 9 39 13 10 30 6 2 24 17 19 5 34 18 33 26 40 21\n\n3 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 3 2 3 2 2 2 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n120\n1\n143654893\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe second test case is shown below.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/0be3e1a1e38f8485a0af76fd4cafe659e8413522.png)Gravity sort of the second testcase.\n\nIt can be shown that permutations of $p$ will yield the same result, and that $c$ must equal $[1,1,1,1,1]$ (since all sand must be the same color), so the answer is $5! = 120$.\n\nThe third test case is shown in the statement above. It can be proven that no other arrays $p$ and $c$ will produce the same final result, so the answer is $1$.",
