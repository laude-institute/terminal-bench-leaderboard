    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2055C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere are no mountains in Florida, and Florida Man cannot comprehend their existence. As such, he really needs your help with this one.\n\nIn the wilderness lies a region of mountainous terrain represented as a rectangular grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each cell in the grid is identified by its position $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index. The altitude of cell $(i, j)$ is denoted by $a_{i,j}$.\n\nHowever, this region has been tampered with. A path consisting of $n + m - 1$ cells, starting from the top-left corner $(1, 1)$ and ending at the bottom-right corner $(n, m)$, has been cleared. For every cell $(i, j)$ along this path, the altitude $a_{i,j}$ has been set to $0$. The path moves strictly via downward ($\\mathtt{D}$) or rightward ($\\mathtt{R}$) steps.\n\nTo restore the terrain to its original state, it is known that the region possessed a magical property before it was tampered with: all rows and all columns shared the same sum of altitudes. More formally, there exists an integer $x$ such that $\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{i, j} = x$ for all $1\\le i\\le n$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i, j} = x$ for all $1\\le j\\le m$.\n\nYour task is to assign new altitudes to the cells on the path such that the above magical property is restored. It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions that satisfy the property, any one of them may be provided.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$) -- the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n+m-2$ ($s_i = \\mathtt{D}$ or $s_i = \\mathtt{R}$) -- the steps the path makes from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$. The character $\\mathtt{D}$ represents a downward step, and $\\mathtt{R}$ represents a rightward step.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines each contain $m$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$ ($-10^6 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^6$) -- the altitude of each cell in the grid. It is guaranteed that if a cell $(i, j)$ lies on the path, then $a_{i,j} = 0$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ lines of $m$ integers representing the restored grid of altitudes $b_{i, j}$. The altitudes must satisfy $-10^{15} \\leq b_{i,j} \\leq 10^{15}$, and additionally $a_{i,j} = b_{i,j}$ if $(i, j)$ is not on the path. If multiple solutions exist, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 3\n\nDRRD\n\n0 2 3\n\n0 0 0\n\n3 1 0\n\n4 5\n\nDRRRRDD\n\n0 1 0 2 3\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n-1 0 -3 -3 0\n\n0 0 0 -1 0\n\n2 3\n\nRRD\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n5 5\n\nDDDDRRRR\n\n0 25 2 9 11\n\n0 6 13 20 22\n\n0 17 24 1 8\n\n0 3 10 12 19\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\n-6 1 0 2 3\n7 -1 3 2 -11\n-1 0 -3 -3 7\n0 0 0 -1 1\n0 -1 1\n0 1 -1\n18 25 2 9 11\n4 6 13 20 22\n15 17 24 1 8\n21 3 10 12 19\n7 14 16 23 5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the grid has been filled such that every row and column contains the numbers $1, 2, 3$ in some order, resulting in a common sum of $6$.\n\nIn the second test case, the grid has been filled such that all rows and columns sum to $0$.",
