    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2020F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nLet $n$ and $d$ be positive integers. We build the the divisor tree $T_{n,d}$ as follows:\n\n- The root of the tree is a node marked with number $n$. This is the $0$-th layer of the tree.\n- For each $i$ from $0$ to $d - 1$, for each vertex of the $i$-th layer, do the following. If the current vertex is marked with $x$, create its children and mark them with all possible distinct divisors$^\\dagger$ of $x$. These children will be in the $(i+1)$-st layer.\n- The vertices on the $d$-th layer are the leaves of the tree.\n\nFor example, $T_{6,2}$ (the divisor tree for $n = 6$ and $d = 2$) looks like this:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/78c70e79ff2523fff4760665c9512ce7f9360607.png)\n\nDefine $f(n,d)$ as the number of leaves in $T_{n,d}$.\n\nGiven integers $n$, $k$, and $d$, please compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$, modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n$^\\dagger$ In this problem, we say that an integer $y$ is a divisor of $x$ if $y \\ge 1$ and there exists an integer $z$ such that $x = y \\cdot z$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $d$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le k,d \\le 10^5$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^9$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$, modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n6 1 1\n\n1 3 3\n\n10 1 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n14\n1\n53\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $n = 6$, $k = 1$, and $d = 1$. Thus, we need to find the total number of leaves in the divisor trees $T_{1,1}$, $T_{2,1}$, $T_{3,1}$, $T_{4,1}$, $T_{5,1}$, $T_{6,1}$.\n\n- $T_{1,1}$ has only one leaf, which is marked with $1$.\n- $T_{2,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $2$.\n- $T_{3,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $3$.\n- $T_{4,1}$ has three leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, and $4$.\n- $T_{5,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $5$.\n- $T_{6,1}$ has four leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$.\n\nThe total number of leaves is $1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 14$.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 1$, $k = 3$, $d = 3$. Thus, we need to find the number of leaves in $T_{1,3}$, because $1^3 = 1$. This tree has only one leaf, so the answer is $1$.",
