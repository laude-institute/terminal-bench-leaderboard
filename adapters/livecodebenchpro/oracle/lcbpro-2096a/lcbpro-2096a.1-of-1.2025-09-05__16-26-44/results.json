    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2096A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are the proud owner of $n$ sticks. Each stick has an integer length from $1$ to $n$. The lengths of the sticks are distinct.\n\nYou want to arrange the sticks in a row. There is a string $s$ of length $n - 1$ that describes the requirements of the arrangement.\n\nSpecifically, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$:\n\n- If $s_i = \\texttt{<}$, then the length of the stick at position $i + 1$ must be smaller than all sticks before it;\n- If $s_i = \\texttt{>}$, then the length of the stick at position $i + 1$ must be larger than all sticks before it.\n\nFind any valid arrangement of sticks. We can show that an answer always exists.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) -- the number of sticks.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string $s$ of length $n - 1$ consisting of characters $\\texttt{<}$ and $\\texttt{>}$ -- describing the requirements of the arrangement.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$, the $a_i$ are distinct) -- the lengths of the sticks in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n<\n\n5\n\n<<><\n\n2\n\n>\n\n3\n\n<>\n\n7\n\n><>>><\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2 1\n4 3 2 5 1\n1 2\n2 1 3\n3 4 2 5 6 7 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:\n\n- $s_1 = \\texttt{<}$, which means $a_2$ is smaller than $a_1$.\n\nThus, one possible arrangement is $[2, 1]$.\n\nFor the second test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:\n\n- $s_1 = \\texttt{<}$, which means $a_2$ is smaller than $a_1$;\n- $s_2 = \\texttt{<}$, which means $a_3$ is smaller than $a_1$ and $a_2$;\n- $s_3 = \\texttt{>}$, which means $a_4$ is larger than $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$;\n- $s_4 = \\texttt{<}$, which means $a_5$ is smaller than $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$.\n\nThus, one possible arrangement is $[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]$.",
