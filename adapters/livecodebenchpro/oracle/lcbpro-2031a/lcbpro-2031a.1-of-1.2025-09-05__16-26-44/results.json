    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2031A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAmidst skyscrapers in the bustling metropolis of Metro Manila, the newest Noiph mall in the Philippines has just been completed! The construction manager, Penchick, ordered a state-of-the-art monument to be built with $n$ pillars.\n\nThe heights of the monument's pillars can be represented as an array $h$ of $n$ positive integers, where $h_i$ represents the height of the $i$-th pillar for all $i$ between $1$ and $n$.\n\nPenchick wants the heights of the pillars to be in non-decreasing order, i.e. $h_i \\le h_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ between $1$ and $n - 1$. However, due to confusion, the monument was built such that the heights of the pillars are in non-increasing order instead, i.e. $h_i \\ge h_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ between $1$ and $n - 1$.\n\nLuckily, Penchick can modify the monument and do the following operation on the pillars as many times as necessary:\n\n- Modify the height of a pillar to any positive integer. Formally, choose an index $1\\le i\\le n$ and a positive integer $x$. Then, assign $h_i := x$.\n\nHelp Penchick determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the monument's pillars non-decreasing.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$) -- the number of pillars.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le n$ and $h_i\\ge h_{i+1}$) -- the height of the pillars.\n\nPlease take note that the given array $h$ is non-increasing.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n3\n\n2 2 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the initial heights of pillars are $h = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$.\n\n- In the first operation, Penchick changes the height of pillar $1$ to $h_1 := 2$.\n- In the second operation, he changes the height of pillar $2$ to $h_2 := 2$.\n- In the third operation, he changes the height of pillar $4$ to $h_4 := 4$.\n- In the fourth operation, he changes the height of pillar $5$ to $h_5 := 4$.\n\nAfter the operation, the heights of the pillars are $h = [2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$, which is non-decreasing. It can be proven that it is not possible for Penchick to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing in fewer than $4$ operations.\n\nIn the second test case, Penchick can make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing by modifying the height of pillar $3$ to $h_3 := 2$.\n\nIn the third test case, the heights of pillars are already non-decreasing, so no operations are required.",
