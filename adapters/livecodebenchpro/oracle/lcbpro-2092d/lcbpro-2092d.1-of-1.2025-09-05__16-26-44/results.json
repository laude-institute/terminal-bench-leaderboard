    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2092D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn anticipation of a duel with his old friend Fernan, Edmond is preparing an energy drink called \"Mishkin Energizer\". The drink consists of a string $s$ of length $n$, made up only of the characters L, I, and T, which correspond to the content of three different substances in the drink.\n\nWe call the drink balanced if it contains an equal number of all substances. To boost his aura and ensure victory in the duel, Edmond must make the initial string balanced by applying the following operation:\n\n1. Choose an index $i$ such that $s_i \\neq s_{i+1}$ (where $i + 1$ must not exceed the current size of the string).\n2. Insert a character $x$, either L, I, or T, between them such that $x \\neq s_i$ and $x \\neq s_{i+1}$.\n\nHelp Edmond make the drink balanced and win the duel by performing no more than $\\textbf{2n}$ operations. If there are multiple solutions, any one of them can be output. If it is impossible, you must report this.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) -- the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of the characters L, I, and T.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $-1$ if there is no solution. Otherwise, in the first line, output a single integer $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le 2n$) -- the number of operations you performed.\n\nThen the $l$-th of the following $m$ lines should contain a single integer $i$ ($1 \\le i < n+l-1$), indicating the operation of inserting a character between $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$. It must hold that $s_i \\neq s_{i+1}$.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, any one of them can be output. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations in this problem.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\nTILII\n\n1\n\nL\n\n3\n\nLIT\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n-1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the following sequence of operations can be performed: TILII $\\rightarrow$ TLILII $\\rightarrow$ TLTILII $\\rightarrow$ TLTLILII $\\rightarrow$ TLTLTILII.\n\nIn the second test case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is $-1$.\n\nIn the third test case, the initial string already has equal quantities of all substances.",
