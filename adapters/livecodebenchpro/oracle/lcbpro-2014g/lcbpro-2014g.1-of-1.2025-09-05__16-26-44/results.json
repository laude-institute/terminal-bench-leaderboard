    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2014G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nWhat is done is done, and the spoilt milk cannot be helped.\n\nLittle John is as little as night is day -- he was known to be a giant, at possibly $2.1$ metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk.\n\nHis dairy diary has $n$ entries, showing that he acquired $a_i$ pints of fresh milk on day $d_i$. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of $k$ days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day $d_i$ will be drinkable between days $d_i$ and $d_i+k-1$ inclusive.\n\nEvery day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of $m$ pints. In other words, if there are less than $m$ pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least $m$ pints of milk, he will drink exactly $m$ pints and be satisfied, and it's a milk satisfaction day.\n\nLittle John always drinks the freshest drinkable milk first.\n\nDetermine the number of milk satisfaction days for Little John.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\leq t \\leq 10^4$), the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\\le n$, $m$, $k \\le 10^5$), the number of diary entries, the maximum pints needed for a milk satisfaction day, and the duration of milk's freshness.\n\nThen follow $n$ lines of each test case, each with two integers $d_i$ and $a_i$ ($1\\le d_i$, $a_i \\le 10^6$), the day on which the milk was acquired and the number of pints acquired. They are sorted in increasing values of $d_i$, and all values of $d_i$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of milk satisfaction days.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n1 1 3\n\n1 5\n\n2 3 3\n\n1 5\n\n2 7\n\n4 5 2\n\n1 9\n\n2 6\n\n4 9\n\n5 6\n\n5 2 4\n\n4 7\n\n5 3\n\n7 1\n\n11 2\n\n12 1\n\n4 1 3\n\n5 10\n\n9 4\n\n14 8\n\n15 3\n\n5 5 5\n\n8 9\n\n10 7\n\n16 10\n\n21 5\n\n28 9\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n3\n4\n5\n10\n6\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $5$ pints of milk are good for $3$ days before spoiling.\n\nIn the second test case, the following will happen:\n\n- On day $1$, he will receive $5$ pints of milk and drink $3$ of them (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$);\n- On day $2$, he will receive $7$ pints of milk and drink $3$ of them (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$ and $4$ pints from day $2$);\n- On day $3$, he will drink $3$ pints from day $2$ (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$ and $1$ pint from day $2$);\n- On day $4$, the milk acquired on day $1$ will spoil, and he will drink $1$ pint from day $2$ (no more milk is left).",
