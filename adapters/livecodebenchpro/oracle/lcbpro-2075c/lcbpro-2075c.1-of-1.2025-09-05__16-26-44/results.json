    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2075C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMonocarp has installed a new fence at his summer house. The fence consists of $n$ planks of the same size arranged in a row.\n\nMonocarp decided that he would paint his fence according to the following rules:\n\n- each plank of the fence will be painted in exactly one color;\n- the number of different colors that the planks will be painted in is exactly two;\n- the planks of the fence that are painted in the same color must form a continuous sequence, meaning that for all pairs of planks painted in the same color, there will be no planks painted in a different color between them.\n\nMonocarp has $m$ different paints, and the paint of the $i$-th color is sufficient to paint no more than $a_i$ planks of the fence. Monocarp will not buy any additional paints.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of different ways to paint the fence that satisfy all of Monocarp's described wishes. Two ways to paint are considered different if there exists a plank that is painted in different colors in these two ways.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of planks in the fence and the number of different colors of paint that Monocarp has.\n\nThe second line contains $m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$), where $a_i$ is the maximum number of planks that can be painted with the paint of color $i$.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$. The sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of different ways to paint the fence that satisfy all of Monocarp's described wishes.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5 2\n\n2 4\n\n5 2\n\n3 4\n\n12 3\n\n5 9 8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n6\n22\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are $4$ different ways to paint the fence (the sequences of color numbers in which the planks can be painted from left to right are listed below):\n\n1. $[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]$;\n2. $[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$;\n3. $[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]$;\n4. $[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]$.\n\nIn the second test case, there are $6$ different ways to paint the fence (the sequences of color numbers in which the planks can be painted from left to right are listed below):\n\n1. $[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]$;\n2. $[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$;\n3. $[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]$;\n4. $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1]$;\n5. $[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]$;\n6. $[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]$.",
