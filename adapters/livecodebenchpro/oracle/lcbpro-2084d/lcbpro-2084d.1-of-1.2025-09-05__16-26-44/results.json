    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2084D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$, where $m \\cdot k < n$.\n\nFor a sequence $b$ consisting of non-negative integers, define $f(b)$ as follows:\n\n- You may perform the following operation on $b$:\n- Let $l$ denote the current length of $b$. Choose a positive integer $1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq l - k + 1$, remove the subarray from index $i$ to $i + k - 1$ and concatenate the remaining parts. In other words, replace $b$ with\n\n$$[b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{i - 1}, b_{i + k}, b_{i + k + 1}, \\ldots, b_l].$$\n\nf(b)$ is defined as the minimum possible value of $\\\\operatorname{mex}(b)$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$ after performing the above operation at most $m$ times (possibly zero).\n\nYou need to construct a sequence $a$ of length $n$ consisting of non-negative integers, such that:\n\n- For all $1 \\le i \\le n$, $0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$.\n- Over all such sequences $a$, $f(a)$ is maximized.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ which does not occur in the collection $c$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le m < n$, $1 \\le k < n$, $1 \\le m \\cdot k < n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2 1 1\n\n5 2 2\n\n6 1 4\n\n8 2 2\n\n8 1 5\n\n11 3 3\n\n22 6 3\n\n17 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 2 2 0 1\n0 2 1 0 1 0 8 1\n0 1 2 1000000000 1 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0\n0 2 1 0 2 1 0 3 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\n4 0 2 1 3 4 0 2 1 0 3 4 0 1 2 1 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 1$, which is maximized.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 1$, which is maximized. $f(a) = 1$ since you can perform the following operations:\n\n- Choose $i = 3$, remove the subarray from index $3$ to $4$ and concatenate the remaining parts. The sequence $a$ becomes $[0, 1, 0]$.\n- Choose $i = 1$, remove the subarray from index $1$ to $2$ and concatenate the remaining parts. The sequence $a$ becomes $[0]$.\n\nIn the third test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 2$, which is maximized. $f(a) = 2$ since you can perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose $i = 2$, remove the subarray from index $2$ to $5$ and concatenate the remaining parts. The sequence $a$ becomes $[0, 1]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 2$, which is maximized.\n\nIn the fifth test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 3$, which is maximized.\n\nIn the sixth test case, it can be shown that $f(a) = 2$, which is maximized.",
