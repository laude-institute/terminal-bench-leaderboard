    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2110C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn 2077, a sport called hobby-droning is gaining popularity among robots.\n\nYou already have a drone, and you want to win. For this, your drone needs to fly through a course with $n$ obstacles.\n\nThe $i$-th obstacle is defined by two numbers $l_i, r_i$. Let the height of your drone at the $i$-th obstacle be $h_i$. Then the drone passes through this obstacle if $l_i \\le h_i \\le r_i$. Initially, the drone is on the ground, meaning $h_0 = 0$.\n\nThe flight program for the drone is represented by an array $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$, where $h_{i} - h_{i-1} = d_i$, and $0 \\leq d_i \\leq 1$. This means that your drone either does not change height between obstacles or rises by $1$. You already have a flight program, but some $d_i$ in it are unknown and marked as $-1$. Replace the unknown $d_i$ with numbers $0$ and $1$ to create a flight program that passes through the entire obstacle course, or report that it is impossible.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ is given -- the size of the array $d$.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, there are $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$ ($-1 \\leq d_i \\leq 1$) -- the elements of the array $d$. $d_i = -1$ means that this $d_i$ is unknown to you.\n\nNext, there are $n$ lines containing $2$ integers $l_i,r_i$ ($0\\leq l_i\\leq r_i\\leq n$) -- descriptions of the obstacles.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $d_1,d_2,\\ldots,d_n$, if it is possible to correctly restore the array $d$, or $-1$ if it is not possible.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n4\n\n0 -1 -1 1\n\n0 4\n\n1 2\n\n2 4\n\n1 4\n\n3\n\n0 -1 -1\n\n0 1\n\n2 2\n\n0 3\n\n2\n\n-1 -1\n\n0 0\n\n2 2\n\n8\n\n-1 -1 1 -1 -1 0 0 -1\n\n0 0\n\n0 1\n\n0 2\n\n0 2\n\n1 3\n\n0 4\n\n2 5\n\n4 5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 1 1 1\n-1\n-1\n0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one possible answer is $d=[0,1,1,1]$. The array $h$ will be $[0,0+1,0+1+1,0+1+1+1]=[0,1,2,3]$. This array meets the conditions of the problem.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be proven that there is no suitable array $d$, so the answer is $-1$.",
