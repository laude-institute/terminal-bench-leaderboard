    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2062H)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn a two-dimensional universe, a star can be represented by a point $(x,y)$ on a two-dimensional plane. Two stars are directly connected if and only if their $x$ or $y$ coordinates are the same, and there are no other stars on the line segment between them. Define a galaxy as a connected component composed of stars connected directly or indirectly (through other stars).\n\nFor a set of stars, its value is defined as the minimum number of galaxies that can be obtained after performing the following operation for any (possibly, zero) times: in each operation, you can select a point $(x,y)$ without stars. If a star can be directly connected to at least $3$ stars after creating it here, then you create a star here.\n\nYou are given a $n\\times n$ matrix $a$ consisting of $0$ and $1$ describing a set $S$ of stars. There is a star at $(x,y)$ if and only if $a_{x,y}=1$. Calculate the sum, modulo $10^9 + 7$, of the values of all non-empty subsets of $S$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 14$) -- the size of matrix $a$.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow; the $i$-th line contains a string $a_i$ of length $n$ -- the $i$-th row of matrix $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $2^n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{14}$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the sum, modulo $10^9 + 7$, of the values of all non-empty subsets of $S$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n8\n1\n0\n2\n01\n10\n3\n010\n000\n101\n4\n0110\n1001\n1001\n0110\n11\n11111110111\n10000010010\n10111010011\n10111010011\n10111010001\n10000010000\n11111110101\n00000000111\n11011010011\n10010101100\n11101010100\n11\n11011111110\n10010000010\n00010111010\n10010111010\n01010111010\n11010000010\n01011111110\n11000000000\n01010000010\n01000111100\n00000001010\n11\n11010101001\n11001010100\n00000000110\n11111110010\n10000010010\n10111010110\n10111010111\n10111010010\n10000010110\n11111110100\n00000000000\n3\n111\n100\n111\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n4\n9\n355\n593092633\n438667113\n922743932\n155\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $S$ is empty. $S$ has no non-empty subsets. So the answer is $0$.\n\nIn the second test case, $S = \\{(1,2),(2,1)\\}$. $S$ has $3$ non-empty subsets.\n\n- $\\{(1,2)\\}$ and $\\{(2,1)\\}$ -- there is only one star in the set, forming $1$ galaxy.\n- $\\{(1,2),(2,1)\\}$ -- two stars in the set are not connected, forming $2$ galaxies.\n\nSo the answer is $1+1+2=4$.\n\nIn the third test case, $S = \\{(1,2),(3,1),(3,3)\\}$. $S$ has $7$ non-empty subsets.\n\n- $\\{(1,2)\\}$, $\\{(3,1)\\}$, and $\\{(3,3)\\}$ -- there is only one star in the set, forming $1$ galaxy.\n- $\\{(1,2),(3,1)\\}$ and $\\{(1,2),(3,3)\\}$ -- two stars in the set are not connected, forming $2$ galaxies.\n- $\\{(3,1),(3,3)\\}$ -- two stars in the set are connected, forming $1$ galaxy.\n- $\\{(1,2),(3,1),(3,3)\\}$ -- initially, star $(1,2)$ is not in the galaxy formed by $(3,1)$ and $(3,3)$. You can make an operation creating a star at $(3,2)$ connecting to these three stars, forming $1$ galaxy.\n\nSo the answer is $1+1+1+2+2+1+1=9$.",
