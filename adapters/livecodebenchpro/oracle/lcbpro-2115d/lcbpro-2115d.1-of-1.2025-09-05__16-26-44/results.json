    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2115D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nGellyfish and Flower are playing a game.\n\nThe game consists of two arrays of $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$, along with a binary string $c_1c_2\\ldots c_n$ of length $n$.\n\nThere is also an integer $x$ which is initialized to $0$.\n\nThe game consists of $n$ rounds. For $i = 1,2,\\ldots,n$, the round proceeds as follows:\n\n1. If $c_i = \\mathtt{0}$, Gellyfish will be the active player. Otherwise, if $c_i = \\mathtt{1}$, Flower will be the active player.\n2. The active player will perform exactly one of the following operations:\n- Set $x:=x \\oplus a_i$.\n- Set $x:=x \\oplus b_i$.\n\nHere, $\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nGellyfish wants to minimize the final value of $ x $ after $ n $ rounds, while Flower wants to maximize it.\n\nFind the final value of $ x $ after all $ n $ rounds if both players play optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$) -- the number of rounds of the game.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\leq a_i < 2^{60}$).\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($0 \\leq b_i < 2^{60}$).\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains a binary string $c$ of length $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the final value of $ x $ after all $ n $ rounds.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n12 2\n\n13 3\n\n11\n\n3\n\n6 1 2\n\n6 2 3\n\n010\n\n4\n\n1 12 7 2\n\n4 14 4 2\n\n0111\n\n9\n\n0 5 10 6 6 2 6 2 11\n\n7 3 15 3 6 7 6 7 8\n\n110010010\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n15\n6\n11\n5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there's only one round and Gellyfish is the active player of that round. Therefore, she will choose $a_1$, and the final value of $x$ is $0$.\n\nIn the second test case, Flower will be the active player in both rounds. She will choose $a_1$ and $b_2$, and the final value of $x$ is $a_1 \\oplus b_2 = 15$. Flower may also choose $b_1$ and $a_2$ instead for the same result of $x=a_2 \\oplus b_1 = 15$.\n\nIn the third test case, $a_1 = b_1$ so it doesn't matter what decision Gellyfish makes in the first round. In the second round:\n\n- If Flower chooses $a_2$, then $x$ will become $7$. Gellyfish will choose $b_3$ in the third round, so the final value of $x$ will be $4$.\n- Otherwise, Flower chooses $b_2$, then $x$ will become $4$. Gellyfish will choose $a_3$ in the third round, so the final value of $x$ will be $6$.\n\nFlower wants to maximize the final value of $x$, so Flower will choose $b_2$ in the second round. Therefore, the final value of $x$ will be $6$.",
