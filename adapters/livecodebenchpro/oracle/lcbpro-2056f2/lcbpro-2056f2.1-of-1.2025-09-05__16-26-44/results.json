    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2056F2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the constraints on $t$, $k$, and $m$ are higher. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nA sequence $a$ of $n$ integers is called good if the following condition holds:\n\n- Let $\\text{cnt}_x$ be the number of occurrences of $x$ in sequence $a$. For all pairs $0 \\le i < j < m$, at least one of the following has to be true: $\\text{cnt}_i = 0$, $\\text{cnt}_j = 0$, or $\\text{cnt}_i \\le \\text{cnt}_j$. In other words, if both $i$ and $j$ are present in sequence $a$, then the number of occurrences of $i$ in $a$ is less than or equal to the number of occurrences of $j$ in $a$.\n\nYou are given integers $n$ and $m$. Calculate the value of the bitwise XOR of the median$^{\\text{∗}}$ of all good sequences $a$ of length $n$ with $0\\le a_i < m$.\n\nNote that the value of $n$ can be very large, so you are given its binary representation instead.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The median of a sequence $a$ of length $n$ is defined as the $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$-th smallest value in the sequence.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $k$ and $m$ ($1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le m \\le 10^9$) -- the number of bits in $n$ and the upper bound on the elements in sequence $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $k$ -- the binary representation of $n$ with no leading zeros.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $k$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the bitwise XOR of the median of all good sequences $a$ of length $n$ where $0\\le a_i < m$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n2 3\n\n10\n\n2 3\n\n11\n\n5 1\n\n11101\n\n7 9\n\n1101011\n\n17 34\n\n11001010001010010\n\n1 1000000000\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n2\n0\n8\n32\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, $n = 10_2 = 2$ and $m = 3$. All possible sequences with elements less than $m$ are: $[0, 0]$, $[0, 1]$, $[0, 2]$, $[1, 0]$, $[1, 1]$, $[1, 2]$, $[2, 0]$, $[2, 1]$, $[2, 2]$. All of them are good, so the answer is: $0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 2 = 3$.\n\nIn the second example, $n = 11_2 = 3$ and $m = 3$. Some good sequences are $[2, 2, 2]$, $[1, 0, 1]$, and $[2, 0, 1]$. However, a sequence $[2, 0, 0]$ is not good, because $\\text{cnt}_0 = 2$, $\\text{cnt}_2 = 1$. Therefore, if we set $i = 0$ and $j = 2$, $i < j$ holds, but $\\text{cnt}_i \\le \\text{cnt}_j$ does not.",
