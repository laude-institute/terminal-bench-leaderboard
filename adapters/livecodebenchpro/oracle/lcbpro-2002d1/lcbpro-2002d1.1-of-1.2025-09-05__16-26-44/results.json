    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2002D1)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. In this version, the given tree is a perfect binary tree and the constraints on $n$ and $q$ are lower. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nYou are given a perfect binary tree$^\\dagger$ consisting of $n$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and the root is the vertex $1$. You are also given a permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ of $[1,2,\\ldots,n]$.\n\nYou need to answer $q$ queries. For each query, you are given two integers $x$, $y$; you need to swap $p_x$ and $p_y$ and determine if $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ is a valid DFS order$^\\ddagger$ of the given tree.\n\nPlease note that the swaps are persistent through queries.\n\n$^\\dagger$ A perfect binary tree is a tree with vertex $1$ as its root, with size $n=2^k-1$ for a positive integer $k$, and where the parent of each vertex $i$ ($1<i\\le n$) is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{i}{2}\\right\\rfloor$. Thus, all leaves of this tree are at a distance $k - 1$ from the root.\n\n$^\\ddagger$ A DFS order is found by calling the following $\\texttt{dfs}$ function on the given tree.\n\n```\n`dfs_order = []<br/><br/>function dfs(v):<br/>    append v to the back of dfs_order<br/>    pick an arbitrary permutation s of children of v<br/>    for child in s:<br/>        dfs(child)<br/>dfs(1)<br/>````\n\nNote that the DFS order is not unique.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1\\le t\\le10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($3\\le n\\le 65\\,535$, $2\\le q\\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$) -- the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries. It is guaranteed that $n=2^k-1$ for a positive integer $k$.\n\nThe next line contains $n-1$ integers $a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_n$ ($1\\le a_i<i$) -- the parent of each vertex in the given tree. It is guaranteed that $a_i=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{i}{2}\\right\\rfloor$.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct) -- the initial permutation $p$.\n\nThe next $q$ lines each contain two integers $x$, $y$ ($1\\le x,y\\le n,x\\neq y$) -- the positions of the elements to swap in the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $65\\,535$, and the sum of all $q$ does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print $q$ lines corresponding to the $q$ queries. For each query, output $\\texttt{YES}$ if there is a DFS order that exactly equals the current permutation, and output $\\texttt{NO}$ otherwise.\n\nYou can output $\\texttt{Yes}$ and $\\texttt{No}$ in any case (for example, strings $\\texttt{yEs}$, $\\texttt{yes}$, $\\texttt{Yes}$ and $\\texttt{YES}$ will be recognized as a positive response).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3\n\n3 2\n\n1 3\n\n7 4\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n3 5\n\n2 5\n\n3 7\n\n4 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ after each modification is $[1,3,2],[1,2,3],[3,2,1]$, respectively. The first two permutations are valid DFS orders; the third is not a DFS order.\n\nIn the second test case, the permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ after each modification is $[1,2,5,4,3,6,7],[1,3,5,4,2,6,7],[1,3,7,4,2,6,5],[1,3,7,6,2,4,5]$, respectively.",
