    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2040A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$.\n\nTwo players are playing a game. The first player chooses an index $1 \\le i \\le n$. Then the second player chooses a different index $1 \\le j \\le n, i \\neq j$. The first player wins if $|a_i - a_j|$ is not divisible by $k$. Otherwise, the second player wins.\n\nWe play as the first player. Determine whether it is possible to win, and if so, which index $i$ should be chosen.\n\nThe absolute value of a number $x$ is denoted by $|x|$ and is equal to $x$ if $x \\ge 0$, and $-x$ otherwise.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$; $1 \\le k \\le 100$) -- the length of the array and the number $k$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if it is impossible for the first player to win, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" (without quotes) and on the next line the appropriate index $1 \\le i \\le n$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n3 2\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 2\n\n1 2 4 5\n\n5 3\n\n10 7 3 4 5\n\n5 3\n\n1 31 15 55 36\n\n2 1\n\n17 17\n\n2 2\n\n17 18\n\n1 3\n\n6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\n2\nNO\nYES\n3\nNO\nNO\nYES\n2\nYES\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the first player can choose $a_2 = 2$. Then:\n\n- If the second player chooses $a_1 = 1$, the resulting difference is $|2 - 1| = 1$ which is not divisible by $k = 2$.\n- If the second player chooses $a_3 = 3$, the resulting difference is $|2 - 3| = 1$ which is not divisible by $k = 2$.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n- If the first player chooses $a_1 = 1$ and then the second player chooses $a_4 = 5$, the resulting difference is $|1 - 5| = 4$ which is divisible by $k = 2$.\n- If the first player chooses $a_2 = 2$ and then the second player chooses $a_3 = 4$, the resulting difference is $|2 - 4| = 2$ which is divisible by $k = 2$.\n- If the first player chooses $a_3 = 4$ and then the second player chooses $a_2 = 2$, the resulting difference is $|4 - 2| = 2$ which is divisible by $k = 2$.\n- If the first player chooses $a_4 = 5$ and then the second player chooses $a_1 = 1$, the resulting difference is $|5 - 1| = 4$ which is divisible by $k = 2$.\n\nIn any case, the second player wins.",
