    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2096E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are the proud owner of $n$ teddy bears, which are arranged in a row on a shelf. Each teddy bear is colored either black or pink.\n\nAn arrangement of teddy bears is beautiful if all the black teddy bears are to the left of all the pink teddy bears. In other words, there does not exist a pair of indices $(i, j)$ ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$) such that the $i$-th teddy bear is pink, and the $j$-th teddy bear is black.\n\nYou want to reorder the teddy bears into a beautiful arrangement. You are too short to reach the shelf, but luckily, you can send instructions to a robot to move the teddy bears around. In a single instruction, the robot can:\n\n- Choose an index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n - 2$) and reorder the teddy bears at positions $i$, $i + 1$ and $i + 2$ so that all the black teddy bears are to the left of all the pink teddy bears.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of instructions needed to reorder the teddy bears?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of teddy bears.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters B and P -- the colors of the teddy bears. For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the $i$-th teddy bear is colored black if $s_i = \\texttt{B}$ and pink if $s_i = \\texttt{P}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of instructions needed to reorder the teddy bears.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3\n\nPPP\n\n3\n\nBPP\n\n3\n\nPPB\n\n7\n\nPPBPPBB\n\n15\n\nBPBPBBBBBPBBBBB\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n0\n1\n5\n14\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, all the teddy bears are pink. Thus, the arrangement is already beautiful, so the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the second test case, all the black teddy bears are to the left of all the pink teddy bears. Thus, the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the third test case, we can perform $1$ instruction with $i = 1$.\n\nAfter the instruction, the sequence of colors changes from $\\texttt{PPB}$ to $\\texttt{BPP}$, and we are done.\n\nFor the fourth test case, we can perform $5$ instructions as follows:\n\n- $i = 1$: $\\texttt{}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{PPB}}\\texttt{PPBB} \\rightarrow \\texttt{}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{BPP}}\\texttt{PPBB}$\n- $i = 5$: $\\texttt{BPPP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{PBB}}\\texttt{} \\rightarrow \\texttt{BPPP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{BBP}}\\texttt{}$\n- $i = 4$: $\\texttt{BPP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{PBB}}\\texttt{P} \\rightarrow \\texttt{BPP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{BBP}}\\texttt{P}$\n- $i = 3$: $\\texttt{BP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{PBB}}\\texttt{PP} \\rightarrow \\texttt{BP}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{BBP}}\\texttt{PP}$\n- $i = 2$: $\\texttt{B}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{PBB}}\\texttt{PPP} \\rightarrow \\texttt{B}\\color{magenta}{\\texttt{BBP}}\\texttt{PPP}$",
