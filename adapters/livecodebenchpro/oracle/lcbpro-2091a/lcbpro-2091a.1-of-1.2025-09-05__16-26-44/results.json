    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2091A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThe final of the first Olympiad by IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" is scheduled for March 1, 2025. A nameless intern was tasked with forming the date of the Olympiad using digits -- 01.03.2025.\n\nTo accomplish this, the intern took a large bag of digits and began drawing them one by one. In total, he drew $n$ digits -- the digit $a_i$ was drawn in the $i$-th turn.\n\nYou suspect that the intern did extra work. Determine at which step the intern could have first assembled the digits to form the date of the Olympiad (the separating dots can be ignored), or report that it is impossible to form this date from the drawn digits. Note that leading zeros must be displayed.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 20$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($0 \\leq a_i \\leq 9$) -- the numbers that the intern pulled out in chronological order.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of digits that the intern could pull out. If all the digits cannot be used to make a date, output the number $0$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n10\n\n2 0 1 2 3 2 5 0 0 1\n\n8\n\n2 0 1 2 3 2 5 0\n\n8\n\n2 0 1 0 3 2 5 0\n\n16\n\n2 3 1 2 3 0 1 9 2 1 0 3 5 4 0 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n9\n0\n8\n15\n```",
