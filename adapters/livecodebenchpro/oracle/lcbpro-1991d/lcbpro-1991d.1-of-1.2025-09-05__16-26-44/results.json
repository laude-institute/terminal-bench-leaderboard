    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1991D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, numbered from $1$ to $n$. There is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ if and only if $u \\oplus v$ is a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), where $\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nColor all vertices of the graph using the minimum number of colors, such that no two vertices directly connected by an edge have the same color.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n$) -- the minimum number of colors required.\n\nThe second line should contain $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le k$) -- the color of each vertex.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n1\n2\n1 2\n2\n1 2 2\n3\n1 2 2 3\n3\n1 2 2 3 3\n4\n1 2 2 3 3 4```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of colors is $1$, because there is only one vertex.\n\nIn the second test case, the minimum number of colors is $2$, because there is an edge connecting $1$ and $2$ ($1 \\oplus 2 = 3$, which is a prime number).\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of colors is still $2$, because $2$ and $3$ can be colored the same since there is no edge between $2$ and $3$ ($2 \\oplus 3 = 1$, which is not a prime number).\n\nIn the fourth test case, it can be shown that the minimum number of colors is $3$.\n\nIn the fifth test case, it can be shown that the minimum number of colors is $3$.\n\nIn the sixth test case, it can be shown that the minimum number of colors is $4$.",
