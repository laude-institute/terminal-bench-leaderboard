    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2117A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYousef is at the entrance of a long hallway with $n$ doors in a row, numbered from $1$ to $n$. He needs to pass through all the doors from $1$ to $n$ in order of numbering and reach the exit (past door $n$).\n\nEach door can be open or closed. If a door is open, Yousef passes through it in $1$ second. If the door is closed, Yousef can't pass through it.\n\nHowever, Yousef has a special button which he can use at most once at any moment. This button makes all closed doors become open for $x$ seconds.\n\nYour task is to determine if Yousef can pass through all the doors if he can use the button at most once.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n, x$ ($1 \\le n, x \\le 10$) -- the number of doors and the number of seconds of the button, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ ($a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) -- the state of each door. Open doors are represented by '0', while closed doors are represented by '1'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each test case contains at least one closed door.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if Yousef can reach the exit, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n4 2\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n6 3\n\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\n8 8\n\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n\n1 2\n\n1\n\n5 1\n\n1 0 1 0 1\n\n7 4\n\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\n10 3\n\n0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the optimal way is as follows:\n\n- At time $0$, the door is open, so Yousef passes.\n- At time $1$, the door is closed, Yousef can use the button now and pass through the door.\n- At time $2$, the button's effect is still on, so Yousef can still pass.\n- At time $3$, the button's effect has finished, but the door is open. Yousef passes and reaches the exit.\n\nIn the second test case, Yousef has a 3-second button, but he would need at least a 4-second button to reach the exit. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\nIn the third test case, Yousef can turn on the button before starting to move. All the doors will stay open until he reaches the exit.",
