    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2104G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSurely, you have seen problems which require you to output the answer modulo $10^9+7$, $10^9+9$, or $998244353$. But have you ever seen a problem where you have to print the answer modulo $3$?\n\nYou are given a functional graph consisting of $n$ vertices, numbered from $1$ to $n$. It is a directed graph, in which each vertex has exactly one outgoing arc. The graph is given as the array $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$, where $g_i$ means that there is an arc that goes from $i$ to $g_i$. For some vertices, the outgoing arcs might be self-loops.\n\nInitially, all vertices of the graph are colored in color $1$. You can perform the following operation: select a vertex and a color from $1$ to $k$, and then color this vertex and all vertices that are reachable from it. You can perform this operation any number of times (even zero).\n\nYou should process $q$ queries. The query is described by three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$. For each query, you should:\n\n- assign $g_x := y$;\n- then calculate the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$ (two colorings are different if there exists at least one vertex that is colored in different colors in these two colorings); since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $3$.\n\nNote that in every query, the initial coloring of the graph is reset (all vertices initially have color $1$ in each query).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$ ($1 \\le g_i \\le n$).\n\nThe $q$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $k_i$ ($1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$; $1 \\le k_i \\le 10^9$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, print a single integerÂ -- the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$, taken modulo $3$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4 5\n\n2 3 1 4\n\n4 3 1\n\n2 1 2\n\n3 4 3\n\n4 1 5\n\n2 4 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n0\n2\n1\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n8 10\n\n7 4 6 8 7 7 1 4\n\n1 7 5\n\n2 3 3\n\n8 6 1\n\n3 1 3\n\n7 2 5\n\n5 2 4\n\n2 7 4\n\n4 6 5\n\n5 2 3\n\n4 5 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n1\n0\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n```",
