    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2001B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere is an integer sequence $a$ of length $n$, where each element is initially $-1$.\n\nMisuki has two typewriters where the first one writes letters from left to right, with a pointer initially pointing to $1$, and another writes letters from right to left with a pointer initially pointing to $n$.\n\nMisuki would choose one of the typewriters and use it to perform the following operations until $a$ becomes a permutation of $[1, 2, \\ldots, n]$\n\n- write number: write the minimum positive integer that isn't present in the array $a$ to the element $a_i$, $i$ is the position where the pointer points at. Such operation can be performed only when $a_i = -1$.\n- carriage return: return the pointer to its initial position (i.e. $1$ for the first typewriter, $n$ for the second)\n- move pointer: move the pointer to the next position, let $i$ be the position the pointer points at before this operation, if Misuki is using the first typewriter, $i := i + 1$ would happen, and $i := i - 1$ otherwise. Such operation can be performed only if after the operation, $1 \\le i \\le n$ holds.\n\nYour task is to construct any permutation $p$ of length $n$, such that the minimum number of carriage return operations needed to make $a = p$ is the same no matter which typewriter Misuki is using.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a line of $n$ integers, representing the permutation $p$ of length $n$ such that the minimum number of carriage return operations needed to make $a = p$ is the same no matter which typewriter Misuki is using, or $-1$ if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIf there are multiple valid permutations, you can output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n3\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n-1\n3 1 2```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first testcase, it's possible to make $a = p = [1]$ using $0$ carriage return operations.\n\nIn the second testcase, it is possible to make $a = p = [1, 2]$ with the minimal number of carriage returns as follows:\n\nIf Misuki is using the first typewriter:\n\n- Write number: write $1$ to $a_1$, $a$ becomes $[1, -1]$\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $2$)\n- Write number: write $2$ to $a_2$, $a$ becomes $[1, 2]$\n\nIf Misuki is using the second typewriter:\n\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $1$)\n- Write number: write $1$ to $a_1$, $a$ becomes $[1, -1]$\n- Carriage return: return the pointer to $2$.\n- Write number: write $2$ to $a_2$, $a$ becomes $[1, 2]$\n\nIt can be proven that the minimum number of carriage returns needed to transform $a$ into $p$ when using the first typewriter is $0$ and it is $1$ when using the second one, so this permutation is not valid.\n\nSimilarly, $p = [2, 1]$ is also not valid, so there is no solution for $n = 2$.\n\nIn the third testcase, it is possibile to make $a = p = [3, 1, 2]$ with $1$ carriage return with both the first and the second typewriter. It can be proven that, for both typewriters, it is impossible to write $p$ with $0$ carriage returns.\n\nWith the first typewriter it is possible to:\n\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $2$)\n- Write number: write $1$ to $a_2$, $a$ becomes $[-1, 1, -1]$\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $3$)\n- Write number: write $2$ to $a_3$, $a$ becomes $[-1, 1, 2]$\n- Carriage return: return the pointer to $1$.\n- Write number: write $3$ to $a_1$, $a$ becomes $[3,1,2]$\n\nWith the second typewriter it is possible to:\n\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $2$)\n- Write number: write $1$ to $a_2$, $a$ becomes $[-1, 1, -1]$\n- Carriage return: return the pointer to $3$.\n- Write number: write $2$ to $a_3$, $a$ becomes $[-1, 1, 2]$\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $2$)\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position. (i.e. $1$)\n- Write number: write $3$ to $a_1$, $a$ becomes $[3, 1, 2]$",
