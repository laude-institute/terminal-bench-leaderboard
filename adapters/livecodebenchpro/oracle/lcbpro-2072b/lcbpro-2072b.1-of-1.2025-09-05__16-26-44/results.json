    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2072B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAfter completing the first quest, Akito left the starting cave. After a while, he stumbled upon a goblin village.\n\nSince Akito had nowhere to live, he wanted to find out the price of housing. It is well known that goblins write numbers as a string of characters '-' and '\\_', and the value represented by the string $s$ is the number of distinct subsequences$^{\\text{∗}}$ of the string $s$ that are equal to the string \"\\-\\_\\-\" (this is very similar to goblin faces).\n\nFor example, the string $s=$\"\\-\\_\\-\\-\\_-\" represents the number $6$, as it has $6$ subsequences \"\\-\\_\\-\":\n\n1. $s_1+s_2+s_3$\n2. $s_1+s_2+s_4$\n3. $s_1+s_2+s_6$\n4. $s_1+s_5+s_6$\n5. $s_3+s_5+s_6$\n6. $s_4+s_5+s_6$\n\nInitially, the goblins wrote a random string-number $s$ in response to Akito's question, but then they realized that they wanted to take as much gold as possible from the traveler. To do this, they ask you to rearrange the characters in the string $s$ so that the value of the number represented by the string $s$ is maximized.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A subsequence of a string $a$ is a string $b$ that can be obtained by deleting several (possibly $0$) characters from $a$. Subsequences are considered different if they are obtained by deleting different sets of indices.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains the number $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, there is one number $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the string written by the goblins.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, there is a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of characters '-' and '\\_' -- the string written by the goblins.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, you need to output one number -- the maximum number of subsequences equal to the string \"-\\_-\", if the characters in the string $s$ are optimally rearranged.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n3\n\n\\-\\-\\_\n\n5\n\n\\_\\_\\-\\_\\_\n\n9\n\n\\-\\-\\_\\_\\-\\_---\n\n4\n\n\\_\\-\\-\\_\n\n10\n\n\\_\\-\\_\\-\\_\\-\\_-\\_-\n\n7\n\n\\_\\-\\-\\----\n\n1\n\n-\n\n2\n\n\\_-\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n0\n27\n2\n30\n9\n0\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it is beneficial to rearrange the characters to form the string \"-\\_-\". This is the only string of three characters that has at least one subsequence \"-\\_-\".\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one character \"-\", and at least two are needed for the subsequence \"-\\_-\". This means that for any rearrangement of characters, the answer will be $0$.\n\nIn the seventh and eighth test cases, the length of the string $n < 3$, which means that subsequences of length $3$ do not exist.",
