    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2030G2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. In this version, $n \\leq 10^6$. You can only make hacks if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nOrangutans are powerful beings--so powerful that they only need $1$ unit of time to destroy every vulnerable planet in the universe!\n\nThere are $n$ planets in the universe. Each planet has an interval of vulnerability $[l, r]$, during which it will be exposed to destruction by orangutans. Orangutans can also expand the interval of vulnerability of any planet by $1$ unit.\n\nSpecifically, suppose the expansion is performed on planet $p$ with interval of vulnerability $[l_p, r_p]$. Then, the resulting interval of vulnerability may be either $[l_p - 1, r_p]$ or $[l_p, r_p + 1]$.\n\nGiven a set of planets, orangutans can destroy all planets if the intervals of vulnerability of all planets in the set intersect at least one common point. Let the score of such a set denote the minimum number of expansions that must be performed.\n\nOrangutans are interested in the sum of scores of all non-empty subsets of the planets in the universe. As the answer can be large, output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$) -- the number of planets in the universe.\n\nThe following $n$ lines contain two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$) -- the initial interval of vulnerability of the $i$-th planet.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $10^6$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output an integer -- the sum of scores to destroy all non-empty subsets of the planets in the universe, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 1\n\n2 3\n\n3 3\n\n4\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\n2 4\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n1 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n6\n24\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first testcase, there are seven non-empty subsets of planets we must consider:\n\n- For each of the subsets $\\{[1,1]\\}, \\{[2,3]\\}, \\{[3,3]\\}$, the score is $0$.\n- For the subset $\\{[2,3], [3,3]\\}$, the score is $0$, because the point $3$ is already contained in both planets' interval of vulnerability.\n- For the subset $\\{[1,1], [2,3]\\}$, the score is $1$. By using one operation on changing the interval of vulnerability of the second planet to be $[1,3]$, the two planets now both have the point $1$ in their interval.\n- For the subset $\\{[1,1], [3,3]\\}$, the score is $2$. By using two operations on changing the interval of vulnerability of the first planet to be $[1,3]$, the two planets now both have the point $3$ in their interval.\n- For the subset $\\{[1,1], [2,3], [3,3]\\}$, the score is $2$. By using one operation on changing the interval of vulnerability of the first planet to be $[1,2]$ and one operation on changing the interval of vulnerability of the third planet to $[2,3]$, all three planets will have the point $2$ in their interval.\n\nThe sum of scores of all non-empty subsets of the first testcase is $0 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 2\\cdot2 = 5$.",
