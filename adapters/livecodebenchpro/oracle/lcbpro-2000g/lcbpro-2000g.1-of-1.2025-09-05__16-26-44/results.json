    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2000G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou live in a city consisting of $n$ intersections and $m$ streets connecting some pairs of intersections. You can travel in either direction on each street. No two streets connect the same pair of intersections, and no street connects an intersection to itself. You can reach any intersection from any other, possibly passing through some other intersections.\n\nEvery minute, you can board a bus at intersection $u_i$ and travel for $l_{i1}$ minutes to intersection $v_i$. Conversely, you can travel from intersection $v_i$ to intersection $u_i$ in $l_{i1}$ minutes. You can only board and exit the bus at intersections. You can only board the bus at an intersection if you are currently there.\n\nYou can also walk along each street, which takes $l_{i2} > l_{i1}$ minutes.\n\nYou can make stops at intersections.\n\nYou live at intersection number $1$. Today you woke up at time $0$, and you have an important event scheduled at intersection number $n$, which you must reach no later than time $t_0$. You also have a phone call planned that will last from $t_1$ to $t_2$ minutes ($t_1 < t_2 < t_0$).\n\nDuring the phone call, you cannot ride the bus, but you can walk along any streets, make stops, or stay at home. You can exit the bus at minute $t_1$ and board the bus again at minute $t_2$.\n\nSince you want to get enough sleep, you became curious -- how late can you leave home to have time to talk on the phone and still not be late for the event?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le m \\le 10^5$) -- the number of intersections and streets in the city.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains three integers $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$ ($1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < t_0 \\le 10^9$) -- the start time of the event, the start time of the phone call, and its end time, respectively.\n\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain descriptions of the streets.\n\nThe $i$-th line contains four integers $u_i$, $v_i$, $l_{i1}$, $l_{i2}$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$, $1 \\le l_{i1} < l_{i2} \\le 10^9$) -- the numbers of the intersections connected by the $i$-th street, as well as the travel time along the street by bus and on foot. It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of intersections and that it is possible to reach any intersection from any other.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of the values of $m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the latest time you can leave home to have time to talk on the phone and not be late for the event. If you cannot reach the event on time, output -1.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n5 5\n\n100 20 80\n\n1 5 30 100\n\n1 2 20 50\n\n2 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n4 5 20 50\n\n2 1\n\n100 50 60\n\n1 2 55 110\n\n4 4\n\n100 40 60\n\n1 2 30 100\n\n2 4 30 100\n\n1 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n3 3\n\n100 80 90\n\n1 2 1 10\n\n2 3 10 50\n\n1 3 20 21\n\n3 2\n\n58 55 57\n\n2 1 1 3\n\n2 3 3 4\n\n2 1\n\n12 9 10\n\n2 1 6 10\n\n5 5\n\n8 5 6\n\n2 1 1 8\n\n2 3 4 8\n\n4 2 2 4\n\n5 3 3 4\n\n4 5 2 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n-1\n60\n80\n53\n3\n2\n```",
