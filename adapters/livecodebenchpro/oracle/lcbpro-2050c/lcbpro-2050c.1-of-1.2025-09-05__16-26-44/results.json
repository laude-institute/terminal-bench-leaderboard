    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2050C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a number $n$ with a length of no more than $10^5$.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit $x$, then the value of $x^2$ must be less than $10$).\n\nIs it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by $9$ through these operations?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)Â -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains the number $n$, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed $10^5$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by $9$ using the described operations, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n123\n\n322\n\n333333333333\n\n9997\n\n5472778912773\n\n1234567890\n\n23\n\n33\n\n52254522632\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, from the integer $123$, it is possible to obtain only $123$, $143$, $129$, and $149$, none of which are divisible by $9$.\n\nIn the second example, you need to replace the second digit with its square; then $n$ will equal $342 = 38 \\cdot 9$.\n\nIn the third example, the integer is already divisible by $9$.",
