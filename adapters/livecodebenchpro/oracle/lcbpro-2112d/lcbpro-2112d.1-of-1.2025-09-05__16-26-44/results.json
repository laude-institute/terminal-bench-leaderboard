    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2112D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nLet $u$ and $v$ be two distinct vertices in a directed graph. Let's call the ordered pair $(u, v)$ good if there exists a path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ along the edges of the graph.\n\nYou are given an undirected tree with $n$ vertices and $n - 1$ edges. Determine whether it is possible to assign a direction to each edge of this tree so that the number of good pairs in it is exactly $n$. If it is possible, print any way to direct the edges resulting in exactly $n$ good pairs.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/0f17bdc8df6de9dcbcefe04d44049c8911e607a8.png)One possible directed version of the tree for the first test case.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe next $n - 1$ lines describe the edges. The $i$-th line contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$; $u_i \\neq v_i$) -- the vertices connected by the $i$-th edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the edges in each test case form an undirected tree and that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print \"NO\" (case-insensitive) if it is impossible to direct all edges of the tree and obtain exactly $n$ good pairs of vertices.\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" (case-insensitive) and then print $n - 1$ pairs of integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ separated by spaces -- the edges directed from $u_i$ to $v_i$.\n\nThe edges can be printed in any order. If there are multiple answers, output any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 4\n\n1 3\n\n3 5\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n4 5\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n4\n\n3 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\n1 2\n3 1\n3 5\n4 2\nYES\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 4\nNO\nYES\n1 3\n2 1\n2 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe tree from the first test case and its possible directed version are shown in the legend above. In this version, there are exactly $5$ good pairs of vertices: $(3, 5)$, $(3, 1)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 2)$, and $(4, 2)$.\n\nOne possible directed version of the tree from the second test case is shown below:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/e52886ce22e1a452186a3dfa3c2cc602f6c4d2ec.png)\n\nIn the presented answer, there are exactly $5$ good pairs of vertices: $(2, 1)$, $(3, 1)$, $(4, 1)$, $(5, 4)$, and $(5, 1)$.\n\nIn the third test case, there are only two directed pairs of vertices, but for any direction of the edge, only one pair will be good.",
