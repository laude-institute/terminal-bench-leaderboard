    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2033A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSakurako and Kosuke decided to play some games with a dot on a coordinate line. The dot is currently located in position $x=0$. They will be taking turns, and Sakurako will be the one to start.\n\nOn the $i$-th move, the current player will move the dot in some direction by $2\\cdot i-1$ units. Sakurako will always be moving the dot in the negative direction, whereas Kosuke will always move it in the positive direction.\n\nIn other words, the following will happen:\n\n1. Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $-1$, $x = -1$ now\n2. Kosuke will change the position of the dot by $3$, $x = 2$ now\n3. Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $-5$, $x = -3$ now\n4. $\\cdots$\n\nThey will keep on playing while the absolute value of the coordinate of the dot does not exceed $n$. More formally, the game continues while $-n\\le x\\le n$. It can be proven that the game will always end.\n\nYour task is to determine who will be the one who makes the last turn.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 100$) -- the number of games that Sakurako and Kosuke played.\n\nEach game is described by one number $n$ ($1 \\le n\\le 100$) -- the number that defines the condition when the game ends.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each of the $t$ games, output a line with the result of that game. If Sakurako makes the last turn, output \"Sakurako\" (without quotes); else output \"Kosuke\".\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n98\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nKosuke\nSakurako\nKosuke\nSakurako\n```",
