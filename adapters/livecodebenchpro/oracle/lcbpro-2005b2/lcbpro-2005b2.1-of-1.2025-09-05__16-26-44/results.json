    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2005B2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $m$ and $q$. In this version, $m, q \\le 10^5$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nNarek and Tsovak were busy preparing this round, so they have not managed to do their homework and decided to steal David's homework. Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teachers to help her catch David. And now $m$ teachers together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.\n\nThe classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from $1$ to $n$, inclusive.\n\nAt the start, all $m$ teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move\n\n- David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n- Then, each of the $m$ teachers simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n\nThis continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees others' moves, so they all act optimally.\n\nYour task is to find how many moves it will take for the teachers to catch David if they all act optimally.\n\nActing optimally means the student makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him; and the teachers coordinate with each other to make their moves in a way that minimizes the number of moves they need to catch the student.\n\nAlso, as Narek and Tsovak think this task is easy, they decided to give you $q$ queries on David's position.\n\n### Input\n\nIn the first line of the input, you are given a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, you are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $q$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le m, q \\le 10^5$) -- the number of cells on the line, the number of teachers, and the number of queries.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, you are given $m$ distinct integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the cell numbers of the teachers.\n\nIn the third line of each test case, you are given $q$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_q$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- David's cell number for every query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that for any $i$, $j$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $1 \\le j \\le q$, $b_i \\neq a_j$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q$ lines, the $i$-th of them containing the answer of the $i$-th query.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n8 1 1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n10 3 3\n\n1 4 8\n\n2 3 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the only query of the first example, the student can run to cell $1$. It will take the teacher five moves to reach from cell $6$ to cell $1$, so the answer is $5$.\n\nIn the second query of the second example, the student can just stay at cell $3$. The teacher, initially located in cell $4$, can reach cell $3$ in one move. Therefore, the answer is $1$.",
