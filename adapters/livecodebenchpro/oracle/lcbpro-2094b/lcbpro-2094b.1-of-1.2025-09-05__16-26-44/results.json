    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2094B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn Bobritto Bandito's home town of residence, there are an infinite number of houses on an infinite number line, with houses at $\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$. On day $0$, he started a plague by giving an infection to the unfortunate residents of house $0$. Each succeeding day, the plague spreads to exactly one healthy household that is next to an infected household. It can be shown that each day the infected houses form a continuous segment.\n\nLet the segment starting at the $l$-th house and ending at the $r$-th house be denoted as $[l, r]$. You know that after $n$ days, the segment $[l, r]$ became infected. Find any such segment $[l', r']$ that could have been infected on the $m$-th day ($m \\le n$).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$)Â -- the number of independent test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $m$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \\leq m\\leq n \\leq 2000, -n \\leq l \\leq 0 \\leq r \\leq n, r-l=n$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output two integers $l'$ and $r'$ on a new line. If there are multiple solutions, output any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n4 2 -2 2\n\n4 1 0 4\n\n3 3 -1 2\n\n9 8 -6 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1 1\n0 1\n-1 2\n-5 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it is possible that on the $1$-st, $2$-nd, and $3$-rd days the interval of houses affected is $[-1,0]$, $[-1,1]$, $[-2,1]$. Therefore, $[-1,1]$ is a valid output.",
