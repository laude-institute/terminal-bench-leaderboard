    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2084F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a permutation $a$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$.\n\nWe say that a permutation $b$ of length $n$ is good if the two permutations $a$ and $b$ can become the same after performing the following operation at most $n$ times (possibly zero):\n\n- Choose two integers $l, r$ such that $1 \\le l < r \\le n$ and $a_r = \\min(a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r)$.\n- Cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r]$ one position to the right. In other words, replace $a$ with $[a_1, \\ldots, a_{l - 1}, \\; a_r, a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r - 1}, \\; a_{r + 1}, \\ldots, a_n]$.\n\nYou are also given a permutation $c$ of length $n$ where some elements are missing and represented by $0$.\n\nYou need to find a good permutation $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ such that $b$ can be formed by filling in the missing elements of $c$ (i.e., for all $1 \\le i \\le n$, if $c_i \\ne 0$, then $b_i = c_i$). If it is impossible, output $-1$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that $a$ is a permutation of length $n$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($0 \\le c_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that the elements of $c$ that are not $0$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- If it is impossible to find such a good permutation $b$, output a single integer $-1$.\n- Otherwise, output $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ -- the good permutation $b$ you've found. You need to ensure that for all $1 \\le i \\le n$, if $c_i \\ne 0$, then $b_i = c_i$. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\n4\n\n3 2 4 1\n\n2 0 0 1\n\n5\n\n3 2 1 5 4\n\n1 3 0 0 0\n\n5\n\n3 2 1 5 4\n\n3 2 1 5 4\n\n5\n\n3 2 1 5 4\n\n3 2 5 1 4\n\n6\n\n3 5 6 2 1 4\n\n0 2 0 5 0 0\n\n6\n\n3 5 6 2 1 4\n\n0 2 0 6 4 0\n\n9\n\n6 9 2 4 1 7 8 3 5\n\n0 2 5 9 0 0 0 8 0\n\n9\n\n8 5 3 9 1 7 4 6 2\n\n0 0 8 0 7 0 4 0 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2\n2 3 4 1\n1 3 2 4 5\n3 2 1 5 4\n-1\n3 2 1 5 4 6\n-1\n-1\n1 3 8 5 7 9 4 6 2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $b = [1, 2]$ is a valid answer since after performing the following operation, $a$ and $b$ will become the same:\n\n- Choose $l = 1, r = 2$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_1, a_2]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[1, 2]$.\n\nIn the second test case, $b = [2, 3, 4, 1]$ is a valid answer since after performing the following operation, $a$ and $b$ will become the same:\n\n- Choose $l = 1, r = 2$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_1, a_2]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[2, 3, 4, 1]$.\n\nIn the third test case, $b = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]$ is a valid answer since after performing the following operation, $a$ and $b$ will become the same:\n\n- Choose $l = 1, r = 3$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_1, a_2, a_3]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]$.\n- Choose $l = 4, r = 5$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_4, a_5]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, $b = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]$ is a valid answer since $a$ and $b$ are already the same.\n\nIn the fifth test case, it is impossible to find such a good permutation $b$, so you should output $-1$.\n\nIn the sixth test case, $b = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 6]$ is a valid answer since after performing the following operation, $a$ and $b$ will become the same:\n\n- Choose $l = 2, r = 4$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_2, a_3, a_4]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 4]$.\n- Choose $l = 3, r = 5$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_3, a_4, a_5]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]$.\n- Choose $l = 5, r = 6$ and cyclically shift the subsegment $[a_5, a_6]$ one position to the right. Then $a$ will become $[3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 6]$.",
