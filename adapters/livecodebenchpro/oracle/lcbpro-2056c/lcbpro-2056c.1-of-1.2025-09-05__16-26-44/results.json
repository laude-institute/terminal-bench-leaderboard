    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2056C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nFor an integer sequence $a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$, we define $f(a)$ as the length of the longest subsequence$^{\\text{∗}}$ of $a$ that is a palindrome$^{\\text{†}}$.\n\nLet $g(a)$ represent the number of subsequences of length $f(a)$ that are palindromes. In other words, $g(a)$ counts the number of palindromic subsequences in $a$ that have the maximum length.\n\nGiven an integer $n$, your task is to find any sequence $a$ of $n$ integers that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- $1 \\le a_i \\le n$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n- $g(a) > n$\n\nIt can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A sequence $x$ is a subsequence of a sequence $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, $[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, $[5, 5, 5, 5]$, and $[4, 3, 3, 4]$ are palindromes, while $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]$ are not.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($\\color{red}{6} \\le n \\le 100$) -- the length of the sequence.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n15\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 1 2 3 1 2\n7 3 3 7 5 3 7 7 3\n15 8 8 8 15 5 8 1 15 5 8 15 15 15 8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, one possible solution is $a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$. In this case, $f(a) = 3$ as the longest palindromic subsequence has length $3$. There are $7$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $3$ that is a palindrome, as shown below:\n\n1. $[a_1, a_2, a_5] = [1, 1, 1]$\n2. $[a_1, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$\n3. $[a_1, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$\n4. $[a_2, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$\n5. $[a_2, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$\n6. $[a_3, a_4, a_6] = [2, 3, 2]$\n7. $[a_3, a_5, a_6] = [2, 1, 2]$\n\nTherefore, $g(a) = 7$, which is greater than $n = 6$. Hence, $a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$ is a valid solution.\n\nIn the second example, one possible solution is $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$. In this case, $f(a) = 5$. There are $24$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $5$ that is a palindrome. Some examples are $[a_2, a_4, a_5, a_8, a_9] = [3, 7, 5, 7, 3]$ and $[a_1, a_4, a_6, a_7, a_8] = [7, 7, 3, 7, 7]$. Therefore, $g(a) = 24$, which is greater than $n = 9$. Hence, $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$ is a valid solution.\n\nIn the third example, $f(a) = 7$ and $g(a) = 190$, which is greater than $n = 15$.",
