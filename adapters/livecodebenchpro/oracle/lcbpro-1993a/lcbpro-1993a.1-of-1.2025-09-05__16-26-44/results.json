    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1993A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nTim is doing a test consisting of $4n$ questions; each question has $4$ options: 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. For each option, there are exactly $n$ correct answers corresponding to that option -- meaning there are $n$ questions with the answer 'A', $n$ questions with the answer 'B', $n$ questions with the answer 'C', and $n$ questions with the answer 'D'.\n\nFor each question, Tim wrote his answer on the answer sheet. If he could not figure out the answer, he would leave a question mark '?' for that question.\n\nYou are given his answer sheet of $4n$ characters. What is the maximum number of correct answers Tim can get?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of $4n$ characters ($s_i \\in \\{\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D}, \\texttt{?}\\}$) -- Tim's answers for the questions.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the maximum score that Tim can achieve.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n1\n\nABCD\n\n2\n\nAAAAAAAA\n\n2\n\nAAAABBBB\n\n2\n\n????????\n\n3\n\nABCABCABCABC\n\n5\n\nACADC??ACAC?DCAABC?C\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n2\n4\n0\n9\n13\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is exactly one question with each answer 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'; so it's possible that Tim gets all his answers correct.\n\nIn the second test case, there are only two correct answers 'A' which makes him get exactly $2$ points in any case.\n\nIn the third test case, Tim can get at most $2$ correct answers with option 'A' and $2$ correct answers with option 'B'. For example, he would get $4$ points if the answers were 'AACCBBDD'.\n\nIn the fourth test case, he refuses to answer any question at all, which makes him get $0$ points.",
