    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2093B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThe cost of a positive integer $n$ is defined as the result of dividing the number $n$ by the sum of its digits.\n\nFor example, the cost of the number $104$ is $\\frac{104}{1 + 0 + 4} = 20.8$, and the cost of the number $111$ is $\\frac{111}{1 + 1 + 1} = 37$.\n\nYou are given a positive integer $n$ that does not contain leading zeros. You can remove any number of digits from the number $n$ (including none) so that the remaining number contains at least one digit and is strictly greater than zero. The remaining digits cannot be rearranged. As a result, you may end up with a number that has leading zeros.\n\nFor example, you are given the number $103554$. If you decide to remove the digits $1$, $4$, and one digit $5$, you will end up with the number $035$, whose cost is $\\frac{035}{0 + 3 + 5} = 4.375$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of digits you need to remove from the number so that its cost becomes the minimum possible?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a positive integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n < 10^{100}$) without leading zeros.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer on a new line -- the number of digits that need to be removed from the number so that its cost becomes minimal.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n666\n\n13700\n\n102030\n\n7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n4\n3\n0\n```",
