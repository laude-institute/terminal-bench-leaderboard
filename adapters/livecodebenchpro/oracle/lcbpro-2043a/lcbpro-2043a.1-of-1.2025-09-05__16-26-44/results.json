    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2043A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nInitially, you have a coin with value $n$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- transform one coin with value $x$, where $x$ is greater than $3$ ($x>3$), into two coins with value $\\lfloor \\frac{x}{4} \\rfloor$.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n5\n\n16\n\n1000000000000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n4\n536870912\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, you have a coin of value $1$, and you can't do anything with it. So, the answer is $1$.\n\nIn the second example, you can transform a coin of value $5$ into two coins with value $1$.\n\nIn the third example, you can transform a coin of value $16$ into two coins with value $4$. Each of the resulting coins can be transformed into two coins with value $1$.",
