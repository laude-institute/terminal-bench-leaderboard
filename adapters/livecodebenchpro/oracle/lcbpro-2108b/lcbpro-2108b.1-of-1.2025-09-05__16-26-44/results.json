    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2108B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOn a recent birthday, your best friend Maurice gave you a pair of numbers $n$ and $x$, and asked you to construct an array of positive numbers $a$ of length $n$ such that $a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus a_n = x$ $^{\\text{∗}}$.\n\nThis task seemed too simple to you, and therefore you decided to give Maurice a return gift by constructing an array among all such arrays that has the smallest sum of its elements. You immediately thought of a suitable array; however, since writing it down turned out to be too time-consuming, Maurice will have to settle for just the sum of its elements.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$\\\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing a pair of numbers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9, \\; 0 \\le x \\le 10^9$) -- the numbers given to you by Maurice.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output your gift to Maurice -- the sum of the elements of the array that satisfies all the described properties. If a suitable array does not exist, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2 1\n\n3 6\n\n1 0\n\n2 0\n\n5 0\n\n2 27\n\n15 43\n\n12345678 9101112\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n8\n-1\n2\n8\n27\n55\n21446778\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one of the suitable arrays is $[2, 3]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a smaller sum of array elements.\n\nIn the second case, one of the suitable arrays is $[1, 3, 4]$. It can also be shown that this is the optimal amount.",
