    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2061I)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKevin and Nivek are competing for the title of \"The Best Kevin\". They aim to determine the winner through $n$ matches.\n\nThe $i$-th match can be one of two types:\n\n- Type 1: Kevin needs to spend $a_i$ time to defeat Nivek and win the match. If Kevin doesn't spend $a_i$ time on it, Nivek will win the match.\n- Type 2: The outcome of this match depends on their historical records. If Kevin's number of wins is greater than or equal to Nivek's up to this match, then Kevin wins. Otherwise, Nivek wins.\n\nKevin wants to know the minimum amount of time he needs to spend to ensure he wins at least $k$ matches.\n\nOutput the answers for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$)Â -- the number of matches.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIf $a_i = -1$, the $i$-th match is of Type 2. Otherwise, the $i$-th match is of Type 1, and $a_i$ represents the amount of time Kevin needs to spend to win this match.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n + 1$ integers. The $i$-th integer represents the minimum amount of time to win at least $i-1$ matches.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n5\n\n3 2 5 4 1\n\n5\n\n100 -1 -1 -1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 3 6 10 15\n0 1 100 100 100 101\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all matches are of Type 2. Kevin can automatically win all matches.\n\nIn the second test case, all matches are of Type 1. Kevin can choose matches in increasing order of $a_i$.\n\nIn the third test case:\n\n- If Kevin spends $a_1$ time on match $1$, he can win matches $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n- If Kevin spends $a_5$ time on match $5$, he can win match $5$.\n- If Kevin spends $a_1$ time on match $1$ and $a_5$ time on match $5$, he can win all matches.",
