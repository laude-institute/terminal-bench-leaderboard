    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2040B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou have an array of zeros $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ of length $n$.\n\nYou can perform two types of operations on it:\n\n1. Choose an index $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le n$ and $a_i = 0$, and assign $1$ to $a_i$;\n2. Choose a pair of indices $l$ and $r$ such that $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$, $a_l = 1$, $a_r = 1$, $a_l + \\ldots + a_r \\ge \\lceil\\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\\rceil$, and assign $1$ to $a_i$ for all $l \\le i \\le r$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) -- the length of the array.\n\nNote that there is no limit on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the minimum number of needed operations of first type.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n20\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can perform an operation of the $1$st type with $i = 1$.\n\nIn the second test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. Operation of $1$st type, $i = 1$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $[1, 0]$.\n2. Operation of $1$st type, $i = 2$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $[1, 1]$.\n\nThe sequence of operations in the second test case![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ecf02679535327fda085e7f1b907288a051b3fb0.png)\n\nIn the third test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. Operation of $1$st type, $i = 1$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $[1, 0, 0, 0]$.\n2. Operation of $1$st type, $i = 4$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $[1, 0, 0, 1]$.\n3. Operation of $2$nd type, $l = 1$, $r = 4$. On this segment, $a_l + \\ldots + a_r = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$, which is not less than $\\lceil\\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\\rceil = 2$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $[1, 1, 1, 1]$.\n\nThe sequence of operations in the third test case![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d3efd70fa3bf233db7f264ab6039a169081d8cf5.png)",
