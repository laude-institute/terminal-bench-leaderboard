    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2106A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn order to test his patients' intelligence, Dr. TC created the following test.\n\nFirst, he creates a binary string$^{\\text{∗}}$ $s$ having $n$ characters. Then, he creates $n$ binary strings $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. It is known that $a_i$ is created by first copying $s$, then flipping the $i$'th character ($\\texttt{1}$ becomes $\\texttt{0}$ and vice versa). After creating all $n$ strings, he arranges them into a grid where the $i$'th row is $a_i$.\n\nFor example,\n\n- If $s = \\texttt{101}$, $a = [\\texttt{001}, \\texttt{111}, \\texttt{100}]$.\n- If $s = \\texttt{0000}$, $a = [\\texttt{1000}, \\texttt{0100}, \\texttt{0010}, \\texttt{0001}]$.\n\nThe patient needs to count the number of $1$s written on the board in less than a second. Can you pass the test?\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $\\texttt{1}$ and $\\texttt{0}$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10$) -- the length of the binary string $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single binary string $s$ of size $n$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of $\\texttt{1}$s on the board.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3\n\n101\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n00000\n\n2\n\n11\n\n3\n\n010\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n0\n5\n2\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first example is explained in the statement.\n\nFor the second example, the only string written on the board will be the string $\\texttt{0}$; therefore, the answer is $0$.\n\nIn the third example, the following strings will be written on the board: $[\\texttt{10000}, \\texttt{01000}, \\texttt{00100}, \\texttt{00010}, \\texttt{00001}]$; so there are five $\\texttt{1}$s written on the board.",
