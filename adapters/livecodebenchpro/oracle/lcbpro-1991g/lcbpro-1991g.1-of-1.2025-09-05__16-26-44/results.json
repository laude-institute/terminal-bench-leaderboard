    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1991G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a grid consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, where each cell is initially white. Additionally, you are given an integer $k$, where $1 \\le k \\le \\min(n, m)$.\n\nYou will process $q$ operations of two types:\n\n- $\\mathtt{H}$ (horizontal operation) -- You choose a $1 \\times k$ rectangle completely within the grid, where all cells in this rectangle are white. Then, all cells in this rectangle are changed to black.\n- $\\mathtt{V}$ (vertical operation) -- You choose a $k \\times 1$ rectangle completely within the grid, where all cells in this rectangle are white. Then, all cells in this rectangle are changed to black.\n\nAfter each operation, if any rows or columns become completely black, all cells in these rows and columns are simultaneously reset to white. Specifically, if all cells in the row and column a cell is contained in become black, all cells in both the row and column will be reset to white.\n\nChoose the rectangles in a way that you can perform all given operations, or determine that it is impossible.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $m$, $k$, and $q$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 100$, $1 \\le k \\le \\min(n, m)$, $1 \\le q \\le 1000$) -- the number of rows and columns in the grid, the size of the operation rectangle, and the number of operations, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $q$, consisting only of characters $\\mathtt{H}$ and $\\mathtt{V}$ -- the sequence of operation types.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer $-1$ if it is impossible to perform all the operations.\n\nOtherwise, output $q$ lines. Each line contains two integers $i$, $j$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$, $1 \\le j \\le m$) -- the coordinates of the top-left cell of the operation rectangle.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n1\n\n4 5 3 6\n\nHVVHHV\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 1\n2 1\n1 1\n2 3\n3 3\n2 2\n```\n\n### Note\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5f11eda6b2e6af97c5175719de15ebefdba4d493.png)Illustration of example.\n\nThe first operation is horizontal. The operation rectangle starts at $(1,1)$ and is a $1 \\times 3$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, and $(1,3)$ become black.\n\nThe second operation is vertical. The operation rectangle starts at $(2,1)$ and is a $3 \\times 1$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(2,1)$, $(3,1)$, and $(4,1)$ become black. At this point, the first column becomes completely black, so all cells in the first column are reset to white.\n\nThe third operation is vertical. The operation rectangle starts at $(1,1)$ and is a $3 \\times 1$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(1,1)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,1)$ become black.\n\nThe fourth operation is horizontal. The operation rectangle starts at $(2,3)$ and is a $1 \\times 3$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, and $(2,5)$ become black.\n\nThe fifth operation is horizontal. The operation rectangle starts at $(3,3)$ and is a $1 \\times 3$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(3,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(3,5)$ become black.\n\nThe sixth operation is vertical. The operation rectangle starts at $(2,2)$ and is a $3 \\times 1$ rectangle. After the operation, cells $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, and $(4,2)$ become black. At this point, two rows and one column become completely black, so all cells in these rows and the column are reset to white.",
