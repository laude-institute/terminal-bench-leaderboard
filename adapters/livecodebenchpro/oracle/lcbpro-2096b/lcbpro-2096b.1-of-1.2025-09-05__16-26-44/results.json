    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2096B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are the proud owner of many colorful gloves, and you keep them in a drawer. Each glove is in one of $n$ colors numbered $1$ to $n$. Specifically, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, you have $l_i$ left gloves and $r_i$ right gloves with color $i$.\n\nUnfortunately, it's late at night, so you can't see any of your gloves. In other words, you will only know the color and the type (left or right) of a glove after you take it out of the drawer.\n\nA matching pair of gloves with color $i$ consists of exactly one left glove and one right glove with color $i$. Find the minimum number of gloves you need to take out of the drawer to guarantee that you have at least $k$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.\n\nFormally, find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that:\n\n- For any set of $x$ gloves you take out of the drawer, there will always be at least $k$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of different colors, and the minimum number of required matching pairs of gloves.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq 10^9$) -- the number of left gloves with color $i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$ ($1 \\leq r_i \\leq 10^9$) -- the number of right gloves with color $i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of gloves you need to take out of the drawer.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 1\n\n100\n\n1\n\n3 2\n\n100 1 1\n\n200 1 1\n\n5 2\n\n97 59 50 87 36\n\n95 77 33 13 74\n\n10 6\n\n97 59 50 87 36 95 77 33 13 74\n\n91 14 84 33 54 89 68 34 14 15\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n6\n101\n303\n481\n1010\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you must take out all of the gloves, so the answer is $6$.\n\nIn the second test case, the answer is $101$. If you take out $100$ gloves or fewer, then it is possible that all of them are left gloves, which means you won't have a matching pair of gloves.\n\nIn the third test case, the answer is $303$. If you only take out $302$ gloves, then one possible scenario is as follows:\n\n- Color $1$: $100$ left gloves, $200$ right gloves\n- Color $2$: $1$ left glove, $0$ right gloves\n- Color $3$: $0$ left gloves, $1$ right glove\n\nYou only have multiple matching pairs of gloves with color $1$. So you won't have at least $2$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.",
