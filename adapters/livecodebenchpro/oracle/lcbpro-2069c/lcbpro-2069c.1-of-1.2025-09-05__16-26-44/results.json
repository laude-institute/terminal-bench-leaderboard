    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2069C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nLet's call an integer sequence beautiful if the following conditions hold:\n\n- its length is at least $3$;\n- for every element except the first one, there is an element to the left less than it;\n- for every element except the last one, there is an element to the right larger than it;\n\nFor example, $[1, 4, 2, 4, 7]$ and $[1, 2, 4, 8]$ are beautiful, but $[1, 2]$, $[2, 2, 4]$, and $[1, 3, 5, 3]$ are not.\n\nRecall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nYou are given an integer array $a$ of size $n$, where every element is from $1$ to $3$. Your task is to calculate the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $a$. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 3$).\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $a$, taken modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n7\n\n3 2 1 2 2 1 3\n\n4\n\n3 1 2 2\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n9\n\n1 2 3 2 1 3 2 2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n0\n1\n22\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case of the example, the following subsequences are beautiful:\n\n- $[a_3, a_4, a_7]$;\n- $[a_3, a_5, a_7]$;\n- $[a_3, a_4, a_5, a_7]$.",
