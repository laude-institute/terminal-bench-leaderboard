    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2056A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere is an $m$ by $m$ square stamp on an infinite piece of paper. Initially, the bottom-left corner of the square stamp is aligned with the bottom-left corner of the paper. You are given two integer sequences $x$ and $y$, each of length $n$. For each step $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the following happens:\n\n- Move the stamp $x_i$ units to the right and $y_i$ units upwards.\n- Press the stamp onto the paper, leaving an $m$ by $m$ colored square at its current position.\n\nNote that the elements of sequences $x$ and $y$ have a special constraint: $1\\le x_i, y_i\\le m - 1$.\n\nNote that you do not press the stamp at the bottom-left corner of the paper. Refer to the notes section for better understanding.\n\nIt can be proven that after all the operations, the colored shape on the paper formed by the stamp is a single connected region. Find the perimeter of this colored shape.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $2 \\le m \\le 100$) -- the number of operations performed and the side length of the square stamp.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le m - 1$) -- the distance that the stamp will be moved right and up during the $i$-th operation, respectively.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the perimeter of the colored shape on the paper.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4 3\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n1 1\n\n6 7\n\n3 6\n\n1 1\n\n3 1\n\n6 6\n\n5 4\n\n6 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n32\n8\n96\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, the stamp has a side length of $3$ and is pressed $4$ times at coordinates $(1, 1)$, $(3, 3)$, $(5, 4)$, and $(6, 6)$. The piece of paper looks like that afterwards:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/9fc3f24b6fa5d2b61c12e4b03034cf4461356a4e.png)\n\nHere, the square formed by the first press is colored blue, the second red, the third green, and the fourth purple. The combined shape, whose perimeter we need to calculate, looks like that:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d3769976097a17e12f245e090e7d4b21ac6d0111.png)\n\nFrom the diagram, it can be seen that this shape has a perimeter of $32$.",
