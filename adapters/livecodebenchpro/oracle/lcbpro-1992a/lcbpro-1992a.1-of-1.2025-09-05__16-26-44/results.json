    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1992A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKmes has written three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ in order to remember that he has to give Noobish\\_Monk $a \\times b \\times c$ bananas.\n\nNoobish\\_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following at most $5$ times:\n\n- pick one of these integers;\n- increase it by $1$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 2$, $b = 3$ and $c = 4$, then one can increase $a$ three times by one and increase $b$ two times. After that $a = 5$, $b = 5$, $c = 4$. Then the total number of bananas will be $5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100$.\n\nWhat is the maximum value of $a \\times b \\times c$ Noobish\\_Monk can achieve with these operations?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10$) -- Kmes's integers.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum amount of bananas Noobish\\_Monk can get.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2 3 4\n\n10 1 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n100\n600\n```",
