    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2075D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given two non-negative integers $x$ and $y$.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $k$ and divide either $x$ or $y$ by $2^k$ rounding down. The cost of this operation is $2^k$. However, there is an additional constraint: you cannot select the same value of $k$ more than once.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum possible cost in order to make $x$ equal to $y$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \\le x, y \\le 10^{17}$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum possible cost in order to make $x$ equal to $y$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n0 1\n\n6 2\n\n3 3\n\n13 37\n\n4238659325782394 12983091057341925\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n6\n0\n26\n32764\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, you can proceed as follows: choose $k=1$ and divide $y$ by $2$. After that, $x$ and $y$ are equal to $0$.\n\nIn the second example, you can proceed as follows: choose $k=2$ and divide $x$ by $4$; choose $k=1$ and divide $y$ by $2$. After that, $x$ and $y$ are equal to $1$.\n\nIn the third example, numbers already are equal.",
