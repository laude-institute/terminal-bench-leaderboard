    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2089B2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, there are no additional limits on $k$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nEcrade has two sequences $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n - 1}$ and $b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{n - 1}$ consisting of integers. It is guaranteed that the sum of all elements in $a$ does not exceed the sum of all elements in $b$.\n\nInitially, Ecrade can make exactly $k$ changes to the sequence $a$. It is guaranteed that $k$ does not exceed the sum of $a$. In each change:\n\n- Choose an integer $i$ ($0 \\le i < n$) such that $a_i > 0$, and perform $a_i := a_i - 1$.\n\nThen Ecrade will perform the following three operations sequentially on $a$ and $b$, which constitutes one round of operations:\n\n1. For each $0 \\le i < n$: $t := \\min(a_i, b_i), a_i := a_i - t, b_i := b_i - t$;\n2. For each $0 \\le i < n$: $c_i := a_{(i - 1) \\bmod n}$;\n3. For each $0 \\le i < n$: $a_i := c_i$;\n\nEcrade wants to know the minimum number of rounds required for all elements in $a$ to become equal to $0$ after exactly $k$ changes to $a$.\n\nHowever, this seems a bit complicated, so please help him!\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$, $0\\le k\\le 2\\cdot 10^{14}$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n - 1}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{n - 1}$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$. It is also guaranteed that in each test case the sum of $a$ does not exceed the sum of $b$, and that $k$ does not exceed the sum of $a$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of rounds required for all elements in $a$ to become equal to $0$ after exactly $k$ changes to $a$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n3 0\n\n1 1 4\n\n5 1 4\n\n4 0\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n4 3 2 1\n\n4 0\n\n2 1 1 2\n\n1 2 2 1\n\n8 0\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\n3 6\n\n1 1 4\n\n5 1 4\n\n4 1\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n4 3 2 1\n\n4 1\n\n2 1 1 2\n\n1 2 2 1\n\n4 2\n\n2 1 1 2\n\n1 2 2 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n4\n4\n8\n0\n2\n2\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the fifth test case, all elements in $a$ become $0$ after exactly $6$ changes.\n\nIn the sixth test case, Ecrade can do exactly one change to $a_3$, then $a$ will become $[1,2,2,4]$.\n\n- After the first round, $a=[3,0,0,0],b=[3,1,0,0]$;\n- After the second round, $a=[0,0,0,0],b=[0,1,0,0]$.\n\nIn the seventh test case, Ecrade can do exactly one change to $a_4$, then $a$ will become $[2,1,1,1]$.\n\n- After the first round, $a=[0,1,0,0],b=[0,1,1,0]$;\n- After the second round, $a=[0,0,0,0],b=[0,0,1,0]$.",
