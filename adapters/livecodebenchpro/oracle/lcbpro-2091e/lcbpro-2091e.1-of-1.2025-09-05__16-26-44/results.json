    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2091E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nRecently, Misha at the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" camp learned a new topic -- the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nHe was somewhat surprised when he realized that $a \\cdot b = lcm(a, b) \\cdot gcd(a, b)$, where $gcd(a, b)$ -- is [the greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the numbers $a$ and $b$ and $lcm(a, b)$ -- is [the least common multiple (LCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple). Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: $F(a,b)=\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}$.\n\nFor example, he took $a = 2$ and $b = 4$, computed $F(2, 4) = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$ and obtained a prime number (a number is prime if it has exactly two divisors)! Now he considers $F(a, b)$ to be an interesting ratio if $a < b$ and $F(a, b)$ is a prime number.\n\nSince Misha has just started studying number theory, he needs your help to calculate -- how many different pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ are there such that $F(a, b)$ is an interesting ratio and $1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nA single line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^7$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of interesting ratios $F(a, b)$ for pairs satisfying $1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n34\n\n10007\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n11\n49\n24317\n```",
