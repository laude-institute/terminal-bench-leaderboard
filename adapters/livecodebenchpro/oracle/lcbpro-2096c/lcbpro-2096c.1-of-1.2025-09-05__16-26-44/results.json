    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2096C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are the proud leader of a city in Ancient Berland. There are $n^2$ buildings arranged in a grid of $n$ rows and $n$ columns. The height of the building in row $i$ and column $j$ is $h_{i, j}$.\n\nThe city is beautiful if no two adjacent by side buildings have the same height. In other words, it must satisfy the following:\n\n- There does not exist a position $(i, j)$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq j \\leq n - 1$) such that $h_{i, j} = h_{i, j + 1}$.\n- There does not exist a position $(i, j)$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$, $1 \\leq j \\leq n$) such that $h_{i, j} = h_{i + 1, j}$.\n\nThere are $n$ workers at company A, and $n$ workers at company B. Each worker can be hired at most once.\n\nIt costs $a_i$ coins to hire worker $i$ at company A. After hiring, worker $i$ will:\n\n- Increase the heights of all buildings in row $i$ by $1$. In other words, increase $h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \\ldots, h_{i, n}$ by $1$.\n\nIt costs $b_j$ coins to hire worker $j$ at company B. After hiring, worker $j$ will:\n\n- Increase the heights of all buildings in column $j$ by $1$. In other words, increase $h_{1, j}, h_{2, j}, \\ldots, h_{n, j}$ by $1$.\n\nFind the minimum number of coins needed to make the city beautiful, or report that it is impossible.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$) -- the size of the grid.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines of each test case contains $n$ integers $h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \\ldots, h_{i, n}$ ($1 \\le h_{i, j} \\le 10^9$) -- the heights of the buildings in row $i$.\n\nThe next line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the costs of hiring the workers at company A.\n\nThe next line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_j \\le 10^9$) -- the costs of hiring the workers at company B.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of coins needed, or $-1$ if it is impossible.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\n100 100\n\n100 100\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n3 2 1 2\n\n1 2 1 1\n\n1 3 1 2\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n5 6 7 8\n\n3\n\n1 2 2\n\n2 2 1\n\n2 1 1\n\n100 100 100\n\n100 100 100\n\n6\n\n8 7 2 8 4 8\n\n7 7 9 7 1 1\n\n8 3 1 1 8 5\n\n6 8 3 1 1 4\n\n1 4 5 1 9 6\n\n7 1 1 6 8 2\n\n11 23 20 79 30 15\n\n15 83 73 57 34 63\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n14\n-1\n183\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, we can see that the city is already beautiful. Thus, the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the second test case, we can hire worker $2$ from company A, worker $4$ from company A, and worker $4$ from company B:\n\n$1\n\n$$2$$\n\n1\n\n$$\\color{red}2$$\n\nimplies\n\n$$1$$\n\n2\n\n$$1$$\n\ncolor{red}3\n\n$$\\color{red}3$$\n\ncolor{red}2\n\n$$\\color{red}1$$\n\ncolor{red}2\n\n$$\\color{red}4$$\n\ncolor{red}3\n\n$$\\color{red}2$$\n\ncolor{red}4\n\n$$1$$\n\n2\n\n$$1$$\n\ncolor{red}1\n\n$$1$$\n\n2\n\n$$1$$\n\ncolor{red}2\n\n$$\\color{red}1$$\n\ncolor{red}3\n\n$$\\color{red}1$$\n\ncolor{red}2\n\n$$\\color{red}2$$\n\ncolor{red}4\n\n$$\\color{red}2$$\n\ncolor{red}4$\n\nThe cost of hiring the workers is $2 + 4 + 8 = 14$. This is the minimum possible cost.\n\nFor the third test case, no matter what we do, it is impossible to make the city beautiful. Thus, the answer is $-1$.",
