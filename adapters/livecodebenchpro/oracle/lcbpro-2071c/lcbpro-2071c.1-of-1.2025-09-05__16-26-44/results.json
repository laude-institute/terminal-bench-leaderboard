    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2071C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn an Italian village, a hungry mouse starts at vertex $\\textrm{st}$ on a given tree$^{\\text{∗}}$ with $n$ vertices.\n\nGiven a permutation $p$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{†}}$, there are $n$ steps. For the $i$-th step:\n\n- A tempting piece of Parmesan cheese appears at vertex $p_i$. If the mouse is currently at vertex $p_i$, it will stay there and enjoy the moment. Otherwise, it will move along the simple path to vertex $p_i$ by one edge.\n\nYour task is to find such a permutation so that, after all $n$ steps, the mouse inevitably arrives at vertex $\\textrm{en}$, where a trap awaits.\n\nNote that the mouse must arrive at $\\textrm{en}$ after all $n$ steps, though it may pass through $\\textrm{en}$ earlier during the process.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $\\textrm{st}$, and $\\textrm{en}$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$; $1 \\le \\textrm{st}, \\textrm{en} \\le n$) -- the number of vertices of the tree, the starting vertex, and the trap vertex.\n\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n$, $u \\neq v$) -- the indices of the vertices connected by an edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- If no such permutation exists, output $-1$.\n- Otherwise, output $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, representing the order in which the cheese will appear at the vertices, ensuring the mouse will eventually be caught at vertex $\\textrm{en}$.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 2 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n6 1 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 5\n\n5 6\n\n1 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n1 2\n3 1 2\n1 4 3 2 6 5```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is only one permutation with length $n = 1$ that is $p = [1]$, which successfully catches the mouse:\n\n\n\n$$\\textrm{st} = 1 \\overset{p_1 = 1}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 1 = \\textrm{en}.$$\n\nIn the second test case, one possible permutation with length $n = 2$ is $p = [1, 2]$:\n\n\n\n$$\\textrm{st} = 1 \\overset{p_1 = 1}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 1 \\overset{p_2 = 2}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 2 = \\textrm{en}.$$\n\nIn the third test case, one possible permutation with length $n = 3$ is $p = [3, 1, 2]$:\n\n\n\n$$\\textrm{st} = 2 \\overset{p_1 = 3}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 3 \\overset{p_2 = 1}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 2 \\overset{p_3 = 2}{\\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1.3cm}}} 2 = \\textrm{en}.$$",
