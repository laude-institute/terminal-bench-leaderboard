    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2111C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, consisting of $n$ integers.\n\nIn one operation, you are allowed to perform one of the following actions:\n\n- Choose a position $i$ ($1 < i \\le n$) and make all elements to the left of $i$ equal to $a_i$. That is, assign the value $a_i$ to all $a_j$ ($1 \\le j < i$). The cost of such an operation is $(i - 1) \\cdot a_i$.\n- Choose a position $i$ ($1 \\le i < n$) and make all elements to the right of $i$ equal to $a_i$. That is, assign the value $a_i$ to all $a_j$ ($i < j \\le n$). The cost of such an operation is $(n - i) \\cdot a_i$.\n\nNote that the elements affected by an operation may already be equal to $a_i$, but that doesn't change the cost.\n\nYou are allowed to perform any number of operations (including zero). What is the minimum total cost to make all elements of the array equal?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$).\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum total cost of operations to make all elements of the array equal.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2 4 1 3\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n10\n\n7 5 5 5 10 9 9 4 6 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n0\n35\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can perform the operation twice:\n\n- choose $i = 3$ and make all elements to the left of it equal to it, the cost will be $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$;\n- choose $i = 3$ and make all elements to the right of it equal to it, the cost will be $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nThe total cost is $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nIn the second test case, all elements are already equal, so no operations need to be performed.",
