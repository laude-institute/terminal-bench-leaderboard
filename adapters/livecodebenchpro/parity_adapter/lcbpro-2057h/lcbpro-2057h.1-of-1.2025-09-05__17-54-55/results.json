    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2057H)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere are very long classes in the T-Generation. In one day, you need to have time to analyze the training and thematic contests, give a lecture with new material, and, if possible, also hold a mini-seminar. Therefore, there is a break where students can go to drink coffee and chat with each other.\n\nThere are a total of $n+2$ coffee machines located in sequentially arranged rooms along a long corridor. The coffee machines are numbered from $0$ to $n+1$, and immediately after the break starts, there are $a_i$ students gathered around the $i$-th coffee machine.\n\nThe students are talking too loudly among themselves, and the teachers need to make a very important announcement. Therefore, they want to gather the maximum number of students around some single coffee machine. The teachers are too lazy to run around the corridors and gather the students, so they came up with a more sophisticated way to manipulate them:\n\n- At any moment, the teachers can choose room $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and turn off the lights there;\n- If there were $x$ students in that room, then after turning off the lights, $\\lfloor \\frac12 x \\rfloor$ students will go to room $(i-1)$, and $\\lfloor \\frac12 x \\rfloor$ other students will go to room $(i+1)$.\n- If $x$ was odd, then one student remains in the same room.\n- After that, the lights in room $i$ are turned back on.\n\nThe teachers have not yet decided where they will gather the students, so for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, you should determine what is the maximum number of students that can be gathered around the $i$-th coffee machine.\n\nThe teachers can turn off the lights in any rooms at their discretion, in any order, possibly turning off the lights in the same room multiple times.\n\nNote that the values of $a_0$ and $a_{n+1}$ do not affect the answer to the problem, so their values will not be given to you.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, there is an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$).\n\nIn the second line of each test case, there are integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the number of students around coffee machines numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $b_1, \\ldots, b_n$, where $b_i$ is the maximum number of students that can be around coffee machines number $i$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2\n\n8 0\n\n5\n\n2 2 2 2 2\n\n5\n\n0 0 9 0 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n8 4\n4 5 4 5 4\n4 6 9 6 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's analyze the first test case:\n\n- To maximize the number of students at the $1$-st coffee machine, all that needs to be done is nothing.\n- To maximize the number of students at the $2$-nd coffee machine, it is sufficient to turn off the lights in the $1$-st room once.",
