There is a list of $n$ booleans, each of which is either true or false, given as a binary string $^{\\text{∗}}$ of length $n$ (where $\\texttt{1}$ represents true, and $\\texttt{0}$ represents false). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.\n\nAlice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of $n-1$ turns since there are $n$ booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.\n\nTo evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false:\n\n- If the statement contains an and operator, choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding it with its evaluation.\n- Otherwise, the statement contains an or operator. Choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding the or with its evaluation.\n\nFor example, the expression true or false and false is evaluated as true or (false and false) $=$ true or false $=$ true. It can be shown that the result of any compound statement is unique.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the string.\n\nThe second line contains a binary string of length $n$, consisting of characters $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$ -- the list of boolean values.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each testcase, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if Alice wins, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n11\n\n3\n\n010\n\n12\n\n101111111100\n\n10\n\n0111111011\n\n8\n\n01000010\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first testcase, Alice can place and between the two booleans. The game ends as there are no other places to place operators, and Alice wins because true and true is true.\n\nIn the second testcase, Alice can place or between the middle true and the left false. Bob can place and between the middle true and the right false. The statement false or true and false is false.\n\nNote that these examples may not be the best strategies for either Alice or Bob.",

You do not know the value of $x$ in advance. Find $f(n)$ such that, no matter what $x$ is, you can always transform it into $n$ using at most $f(n)$ commands.\n\nYour task is to change $x$ into $n$ using at most $f(n)$ commands.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$S(n)$ is a function that returns the sum of all the individual digits of a non-negative integer $n$. For example, $S(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$).\n\n### Interaction\n\nThe interaction for each test case begins by reading the integer $n$.\n\nTo send a command, output a line in the following format:\n\n- \"add $y$\" Add some integer $y$ ($-10^{18} \\le y \\le 10^{18}$) to $x$.\nThe jury will output \"1\" if $x + y$ is within $[1, 10^{18}]$ (successful), and \"0\" otherwise. If successful, update $x \\leftarrow x + y$.\n\n- \"mul $y$\" Multiply $x$ by a positive integer $y$ ($1 \\le y \\le 10^{18}$).\nThe jury will output \"1\" if $x \\cdot y$ is within $[1, 10^{18}]$ (successful), and \"0\" otherwise. If successful, update $x \\leftarrow x \\cdot y$.\n\n- \"div $y$\" Divide $x$ by a positive integer $y$ ($1 \\le y \\le 10^{18}$).\nThe jury will output \"1\" if $y$ is a divisor of $x$ (successful), and \"0\" otherwise. If successful, update $x \\leftarrow \\frac{x}{y}$.\n\n- \"digit\" Make $x$ equal to the sum of its digits.\nThe jury will always output \"1\" and update $x \\leftarrow S(x)$.\n\n\nNote that commands are case sensitive.\n\nWhen you have determined that $x$ is equal to $n$, output a line in the following format:\n\n- \"!\" -- where the jury will output a \"1\" if $n$ is equal to $x$, and \"-1\" otherwise.\n\nNote that answering does not count toward your limit of commands.\n\nIf your program makes more than $f(n)$ commands ($f(n)$ is described above) for one test case, or makes an invalid command, then the response to the command will be \"-1\". After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter printing a command, do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- sys.stdout.flush() in Python;\n- std::io::stdout().flush() in Rust;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nThe interactor is non-adaptive. The unknown integer $x$ does not change during the interaction.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 5000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain two positive integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\leq n,x \\leq 10^9$) -- denoting the unknown integer and the target value to which it should be made equal, respectively.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n2\n100\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n\nadd -10\n\nadd 1\n\nmul 10\n\n!\n\ndigit\n\ndiv 2\n\n!\n```\n\n### Note\n\nSolutionJuryExplanation$\\texttt{2}$There are 2 test cases.$\\texttt{100}$In the first test case, the unknown integer $x = 9$ and we have to make it equal to $n = 100$.$\\texttt{add -10}\n\n$$\\texttt{0}$The answer to \"add -10\" is \"0\". This means that the addition command was not successful as $x + y = 9 + (-10) \\le 0$, and $x$ remains $9$ after the command$\\texttt{add 1}$$\n\ntexttt{1}$The answer to \"add 1\" is \"1\". This means that the addition command was successful as $x + y = 9 + 1 = 10$, and $x$ changes to $10$ after the command.$\\texttt{mul 10}\n\n$$\\texttt{1}$The answer to \"mul 10\" is \"1\". This means that the multiplication command was successful as $x \\cdot y = 10 \\cdot 10 = 100$, and $x$ changes to $100$ after the command.$\\texttt{!}$$\n\ntexttt{1}$The answer to \"!\" is \"1\". This means you have determined that $x$ equals $n$.$\\texttt{5}$In the second test case, the unknown integer $x = 1234$ and we have to make it equal to $n = 5$.$\\texttt{digit}\n\n$$\\texttt{1}$The answer to \"digit\" is \"1\". This means that $x$ turned into the sum of its digits $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$, and $x$ changes to $10$ after the command.$\\texttt{div 2}$$\n\ntexttt{1}$The answer to \"div 2\" is \"1\". This means that the division command was successful as $y = 2$ is a divisor of $x = 10$, and $x$ changes to $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$ after the command.$\\texttt{!}$$\\texttt{1}$The answer to \"!\" is \"1\".

His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates $n$ problems, each consisting of $m$ letters, so Narek has $n$ strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the $n$ strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as $score_n - score_c$, where $score_n$ is Narek's score and $score_c$ is ChatGPT's score.\n\nNarek calculates $score_n$ by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter $\\texttt{\"n\"}$, followed by $\\texttt{\"a\"}$, $\\texttt{\"r\"}$, $\\texttt{\"e\"}$, and $\\texttt{\"k\"}$. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $score_n$ by $5$ and resumes searching for $\\texttt{\"n\"}$ again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).\n\nAfter Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $score_c$ by $1$ for each letter $\\texttt{\"n\"}$, $\\texttt{\"a\"}$, $\\texttt{\"r\"}$, $\\texttt{\"e\"}$, or $\\texttt{\"k\"}$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $5$ letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score $score_c$, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).\n\nNarek aims to maximize the value of $score_n - score_c$ by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.\n\n### Input\n\nIn the first line of the input, you're given a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, you're given two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 10^3$), the number of strings and the length of each string.\n\nIn the next $n$ lines, you're given $n$ strings, each having a length of $m$. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\nThe sum of values of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of $score_n - score_c$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n5 2\n\nnn\n\naa\n\nrr\n\nee\n\nkk\n\n1 5\n\nnarek\n\n1 4\n\nnare\n\n5 7\n\nnrrarek\n\nnrnekan\n\nuuuuuuu\n\nppppppp\n\nnkarekz\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n5\n0\n7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one of the optimal answers is when Narek doesn't choose any of the strings, so the answer is $0$. He can alternatively choose all the strings. In this case, the full string becomes \"nnaarreekk\". Narek can choose the first appearances of all letters and add $5$ to the score. His opponent will add $1$ for all second appearances, which will be $5$ in total. So the answer will be $5 - 5 = 0$.\n\nIn the third test case, the only optimal answer is when Narek doesn't choose the string. Note that if he were to choose the string, he wouldn't be able to find the last letter \"k\", so his score would stay at $0$ instead of becoming $5$. Then ChatGPT would add $4$ for all of the $4$ letters, and the answer would become $0 - 4 = -4$.\n\nIn the last test case, Narek needs to choose the first and the last strings. After putting these two next to each other, he gets \"${\\color{red}{n}}rr{\\color{red}{a}}{\\color{red}{r}}{\\color{red}{e}}{\\color{red}{k}}{\\color{red}{n}}k{\\color{red}{a}}{\\color{red}{r}}{\\color{red}{e}}{\\color{red}{k}}{\\color{blue}{z}}$\". Narek can choose the letters marked with red and add $10$ to his score. Since the black colored letters Narek left behind are eligible for the opponent to claim (they are used in the word \"narek\"), the opponent adds all other letters to the score and gets a score of $3$. Therefore, the answer is $10 - 3 = 7$.",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the maximum possible value of Alice's number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Interaction\n\nThe interaction begins by reading the integer $n$.\n\nThen, output a single integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 20$) -- the number of queries.\n\nTo ask a query, output a line in the following format:\n\n- $k\\,a_1\\,a_2 \\ldots a_k$ ($2 \\leq k \\leq n$, $k$ is even, $1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$, the $a_i$ are distinct) -- the length of the array, and the array itself.\n\nOnce you've asked all $q$ queries, read a string $s$ ($|s| = q$) -- the responses to the queries as described above.\n\nWhen you know Alice's number, output a single integer $x$ ($1 \\leq x \\leq n$) -- the value of the number.\n\nThen, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there are no more test cases.\n\nAfter outputting all $q$ queries, do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nNote that even if you correctly determine Alice's number but use more than $f(n)$ queries, you will get Wrong answer.\n\nFor this problem, hacks are disabled.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n2\n3\n\n?N\n\n5\n\nR?L\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n\n2\n2 1 2\n2 1 2\n\n3\n\n3\n4 3 2 4 1\n4 5 4 3 1\n4 1 5 3 4\n\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $n = 3$. We ask $2$ queries: $[1, 2]$, and $[1, 2]$ again.\n\n- For the first query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{?}$, which means this query is ignored.\n- For the second query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{N}$, which means her number is not in the array $[1, 2]$.\n\nFrom the information above, we can determine that Alice's number is $3$.\n\nIt can be shown that all valid strategies for $n = 3$ require at least $2$ queries.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 5$. We ask $3$ queries: $[3, 2, 4, 1]$, $[5, 4, 3, 1]$, and $[1, 5, 3, 4]$.\n\n- For the first query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{R}$, which means her number is in the array $[4, 1]$.\n- For the second query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{?}$, which means this query is ignored.\n- For the third query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{L}$, which means her number is in the array $[1, 5]$.\n\nFrom the information above, we can determine that Alice's number is $1$.\n\nIt can be shown that all valid strategies for $n = 5$ require at least $3$ queries.",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$), representing the number of the cyclists.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print $n$ integers, the answers for the array $[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i]$ for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots n$ in this order.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1 2 4\n\n4\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n4\n\n4 1 3 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 3 7\n1 2 3 4\n1 3\n4 3 6 8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one possible way to move from the position behind the $n$-th cyclist to the position in front of the $1$-st cyclist is:\n\n- Leo swaps $a_2$ $(i=2)$ and $a_3$ $(j=3)$, then the array becomes $[1,4,2]$; it costs $j-i=3-2=1$.\n- Leo is behind the $3$-rd cyclist and moves behind the $2$-nd cyclist; it costs $a_3=2$.\n- Leo swaps $a_1$ $(i=1)$ and $a_2$ $(j=2)$, then the array becomes $[4,1,2]$; it costs $j-i=2-1=1$.\n- Leo is behind the $2$-nd cyclist and moves behind the $1$-st cyclist; it costs $a_2=1$.\n- Leo swaps $a_1$ $(i=1)$ and $a_2$ $(j=2)$, then the array becomes $[1,4,2]$; it costs $j-i=2-1=1$.\n- Leo moves ahead of the $1$-st cyclist; it costs $a_1=1$.\n\nSo the total cost is $1+2+1+1+1+1=7$. It can be proved that $7$ is the minimum cost.\n\nIn the second test case, to move ahead of the $1$-st cyclist from the position behind the $n$-th cyclist, Leo should not swap anyone's agility value. The total cost is $1+1+1+1=4$.",

In this version of the problem, you can't choose the same integer twice or more. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.\n\nOne day, Turtle was playing with $n$ sequences. Let the length of the $i$-th sequence be $l_i$. Then the $i$-th sequence was $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, l_i}$.\n\nPiggy gave Turtle a problem to solve when Turtle was playing. The statement of the problem was:\n\n- There was a non-negative integer $x$ at first. Turtle would perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of operations on the integer.\n- In each operation, Turtle could choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le n$ and $i$ wasn't chosen before, and set $x$ to $\\text{mex}^{\\dagger}(x, a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, l_i})$.\n- Turtle was asked to find the answer, which was the maximum value of $x$ after performing an arbitrary number of operations.\n\nTurtle solved the above problem without difficulty. He defined $f(k)$ as the answer to the above problem when the initial value of $x$ was $k$.\n\nThen Piggy gave Turtle a non-negative integer $m$ and asked Turtle to find the value of $\\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^m f(i)$ (i.e., the value of $f(0) + f(1) + \\ldots + f(m)$). Unfortunately, he couldn't solve this problem. Please help him!\n\n$^{\\dagger}\\text{mex}(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k)$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ which does not occur in the sequence $c$.

Therefore, $f(3, 4, 2)$ is also successful.\n\nThe total indices chosen were $2$, so the final cost is $2$, which can be shown that is minimum. Note that for this query we can't choose index $4$, since $p_4 = k = 2$.\n\nIn the last query of the second example, we can choose indices $2, 3, 4, 5$ and re-arrange them so $p = [3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4]$.

Each card has two parameters: suit and rank. Suits in the game are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and ranks are numbered from $1$ to $m$. There is exactly one card in the deck for each combination of suit and rank.\n\nA card with suit $a$ and rank $b$ can beat a card with suit $c$ and rank $d$ in one of two cases:\n\n- $a = 1$, $c \\ne 1$ (a card of suit $1$ can beat a card of any other suit);\n- $a = c$, $b > d$ (a card can beat any other card of the same suit but of a lower rank).\n\nTwo players play the game. Before the game starts, they receive exactly half of the deck each. The first player wins if for every card of the second player, he can choose his card that can beat it, and there is no card that is chosen twice (i. e. there exists a matching of the first player's cards with the second player's cards such that in each pair the first player's card beats the second player's card). Otherwise, the second player wins.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins. Two ways are considered different if there exists a card such that in one way it belongs to the first player and in the other way it belongs to the second player. The number of ways can be very large, so print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe only line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 500$).\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: $m$ is even.\n\n### Output\n\nPrint a single integer -- the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins, taken modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n1 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n2\n```\n\n#### Input #3\n\n```\n\n3 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #3\n\n```\n1690\n```\n\n#### Input #4\n\n```\n\n5 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #4\n\n```\n568\n```\n\n#### Input #5\n\n```\n\n500 500\n\n```\n\n#### Output #5\n\n```\n84693741\n```",

The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $n$ and $t$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size $2^n - 1$, with nodes numbered from $1$ to $2^n-1$ and rooted at $1$. For each vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$), vertex $2v$ is its left child and vertex $2v + 1$ is its right child. Each node $v$ also has a value $a_v$ assigned to it.\n\nDefine the operation $\\mathrm{pop}$ as follows:\n\n1. initialize variable $v$ as $1$;\n2. repeat the following process until vertex $v$ is a leaf (i.e. until $2^{n - 1} \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$);\n1. among the children of $v$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $x$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$), you can choose any of them;\n2. assign $a_x$ to $a_v$ (i.e. $a_v := a_x$);\n3. assign $x$ to $v$ (i.e. $v := x$);\n3. assign $-1$ to $a_v$ (i.e. $a_v := -1$).\n\nThen we say the $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $a_{2v} \\neq a_{2v + 1}$ would hold whenever choosing between them.\n\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$), both $a_v \\ge a_{2v}$ and $a_v \\ge a_{2v + 1}$ hold.\n\nA max-heap is deterministic if the $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first and the second time.\n\nInitially, $a_v := 0$ for every vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $\\mathrm{add}$ exactly $k$ times:\n\n- Choose an integer $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$) and, for every vertex $x$ on the path between $1$ and $v$, add $1$ to $a_x$.\n\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\n\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo $p$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 50$).

A polyomino is convex if, for any two squares in the polyomino that share the same row or the same column, all squares between them are also part of the polyomino. Below are four polyominoes, only the first and second of which are convex.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/8724689d0b36a88fea4585d8abc9730b8c0d960d.png)\n\nYou are given a convex polyomino with $n$ rows and an even area. For each row $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the unit squares from column $l_i$ to column $r_i$ are part of the polyomino. In other words, there are $r_i - l_i + 1$ unit squares that are part of the polyomino in the $i$-th row: $(i, l_i), (i, l_i + 1), \\ldots, (i, r_i-1), (i, r_i)$.\n\nTwo polyominoes are congruent if and only if you can make them fit exactly on top of each other by translating the polyominoes. Note that you are not allowed to rotate or reflect the polyominoes. Determine whether it is possible to partition the given convex polyomino into two disjoint connected polyominoes that are congruent to each other. The following examples illustrate a valid partition of each of the two convex polyominoes shown above:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/97de3cd15bf04caabb5cdf47250f4e27c68bed36.png)\n\nThe partitioned polyominoes do not need to be convex, and each unit square should belong to exactly one of the two partitioned polyominoes.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A polyomino is connected if and only if for every two unit squares $u \\neq v$ that are part of the polyomino, there exists a sequence of distinct squares $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k$, such that $s_1 = u$, $s_k = v$, $s_i$ are all part of the polyomino, and $s_i, s_{i+1}$ share an edge for each $1 \\le i \\le k - 1$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of rows of the polyomino.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1\\le l_i\\le r_i\\le 10^9$) -- the range of columns that are part of the polyomino in the $i$-th row.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the area of the polyomino is even. In other words, $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i - l_i + 1\\equiv 0\\pmod{2}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing either \"YES\" or \"NO\", representing whether or not the polyomino can be partitioned as described in the problem.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n4\n\n4 4\n\n2 4\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n3 3\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 3\n\n4\n\n8 9\n\n6 8\n\n6 8\n\n5 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first and second test cases are the polyominoes depicted in the problem statement and can be partitioned as shown.\n\nThe polyomino in the third test case, shown below, can be shown to be impossible to partition. None of the following partitions are valid:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/0a986911d905df1d700e5c6e0a7823b6baa1714b.png)\n\nThe partition on the left does not use polyominoes that are translations of each other, and the partition on the right does not use connected polyominoes.\n\nThe polyomino in the fourth test case, shown below, can be shown to be impossible to partition.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5f032563bda214bb7c65076b4882bda7d0a17e46.png)\n\nNote that while you can partition it into two $1 \\times 2$ rectangles, these rectangles are not translations of each other.",

At the beginning of the game, some of these cards are given to Alice, and the rest are given to Bob.\n\nCard with number $i$ beats card with number $j$ if and only if $i > j$, with one exception: card $1$ beats card $n$.\n\nThe game continues as long as each player has at least one card. During each turn, the following occurs:\n\n1. Alice chooses one of her cards and places it face up on the table;\n2. Bob, seeing Alice's card, chooses one of his cards and places it face up on the table;\n3. if Alice's card beats Bob's card, both cards are taken by Alice. Otherwise, both cards are taken by Bob.\n\nA player can use a card that they have taken during one of the previous turns.\n\nThe player who has no cards at the beginning of a turn loses. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n- the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$) -- the number of cards;\n- the second line contains $n$ characters, each either A or B. If the $i$-th character is A, then card number $i$ is initially given to Alice; otherwise, it is given to Bob.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one card is initially given to Alice, and at least one card is initially given to Bob.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output Alice if Alice wins with optimal play, or Bob if Bob wins. It can be shown that if both players play optimally, the game will definitely end in a finite number of turns with one of the players winning.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2\n\nAB\n\n2\n\nBA\n\n4\n\nABAB\n\n4\n\nBABA\n\n3\n\nBAA\n\n5\n\nAAAAB\n\n5\n\nBAAAB\n\n6\n\nBBBAAA\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nAlice\nBob\nBob\nBob\nAlice\nAlice\nBob\nAlice\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Alice has only one card, and Bob has only one card. Since Alice's card beats Bob's card, she wins after the first turn.\n\nIn the second test case, Alice has only one card, and Bob has only one card. Since Bob's card beats Alice's card, he wins after the first turn.\n\nIn the third test case, there are two possible game scenarios:\n\n- if Alice plays the card $1$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $2$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $3$ on the second turn, and Bob will respond by playing the card $4$. Then, he wins;\n- if Alice plays the card $3$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $4$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $1$, and Bob can respond either with the card $2$ or the card $3$. Then, he wins.\n\nIn the fourth test case, there are two possible game scenarios:\n\n- if Alice plays the card $2$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $3$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $4$ on the second turn, and Bob will respond by playing the card $1$. Then, he wins;\n- if Alice plays the card $4$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $1$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $2$, and Bob can respond either with the card $3$ or the card $4$. Then, he wins.",

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the time limit and the constraints on $n$ and $q$ are lower. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nGellyfish has an array consisting of $n$ sets. Initially, all the sets are empty.\n\nNow Gellyfish will do $q$ operations. Each operation contains one modification operation and one query operation, for the $i$-th ($1 \\leq i \\leq q$) operation:\n\nFirst, there will be a modification operation, which is one of the following:\n\n1. Insert operation: You are given an integer $r$. For the $1$-th to $r$-th sets, insert element $i$. Note that the element inserted here is $i$, the index of the operation, not the index of the set.\n2. Reverse operation: You are given an integer $r$. Reverse the $1$-th to $r$-th sets.\n3. Delete operation: You are given an integer $x$. Delete element $x$ from all sets that contain $x$.\n\nFollowed by a query operation:\n\n- Query operation: You are given an integer $p$. Output the smallest element in the $p$-th set (If the $p$-th set is empty, the answer is considered to be $0$).\n\nNow, Flower needs to provide the answer for each query operation. Please help her!\n\nAdditional constraint on the problem: Gellyfish will only give the next operation after Flower has answered the previous query operation. That is, you need to solve this problem online. Please refer to the input format for more details.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^5$) -- the number of the sets and the number of operations.\n\nAs you need to respond to the operations online, the operations will be encoded.\n\nThe $i$-th line of the following $q$ lines contains three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($1 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $1 \\leq c \\leq n$) -- describing the $i$-th operation in an encoded form.\n\nHere, $a$ represents the type of modification operation. Among them, $a=1$ represents Insert operation, $a=2$ represents Reverse operation, $a=3$ represents Delete operation.\n\n- If $a = 1$, then the modification operation is the Insert operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq n$. $r$ will be calculated as $r=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n- If $a=2$, then the modification operation is the Reverse operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq n$. $r$ will be calculated as $r=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n- If $a=3$, then the modification operation is the Delete operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq q$. $x$ will be calculated as $x=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod q + 1$.\n\nFor the query operation, $p$ will be calculated as $p = (c+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n\nHere $ \\text{ans}_{i} (1 \\leq i \\leq q)$ represents the answer to the query operation in the $i$-th operation. Additionally, we define $ \\text{ans}_{0} = 0$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query operation, output the answer to the query.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5 10\n\n1 2 2\n\n2 3 1\n\n1 5 3\n\n2 2 5\n\n1 5 2\n\n2 4 4\n\n3 2 2\n\n3 1 2\n\n3 10 5\n\n3 2 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n0\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\n5\n0\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nAll the sets are empty in the beginning, so the array is $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$.\n\nWith the decoding method given before, we can see what happens in each operation:\n\n01. For the first operation: $a = 1, r = 2, p = 2$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $1$ is inserted into the first two sets; so the array becomes $[\\{1\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $1$.\n02. For the second operation: $a = 2, r = 4, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first four sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the second set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n03. For the third operation: $a = 1, r = 5, p = 3$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $3$ is inserted into all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the third set is $1$.\n04. For the fourth operation: $a = 2, r = 3, p = 1$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first three sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the first set is $1$.\n05. For the fifth operation: $a = 1, r = 1, p = 3$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $5$ is inserted into the first set; so the array becomes $[\\{1, 3, 5\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the third set is $3$.\n06. For the sixth operation: $a = 2, r = 2, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first two sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{3\\}, \\{1, 3, 5\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $1$.\n07. For the seventh operation: $a = 3, x = 3, p = 3$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $3$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the third set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n08. For the eighth operation: $a = 3, x = 1, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $1$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{5\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $5$.\n09. For the ninth operation: $a = 3, x = 5, p = 5$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $5$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the fifth set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n10. For the tenth operation: $a = 3, x = 2, p = 4$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $2$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the fourth set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n\nPlease note that although we have not inserted element $2$ into the sets, we still delete element $2$ from all the sets in the tenth operation, which means that the Delete operation doesn't necessarily require the existence of a set to contain the deleted element. It also shows that it is possible to have two Delete operations that delete the same element.",

To prevent this, whenever multiple warriors are on guard at the same integer moment, there must be at least one color which is worn by exactly one warrior.\n\nSo the task is to determine the minimum number of colors required and assign a color $c_i$ to each warrior's segment $[l_i, r_i]$ such that, for every (integer) time $t$ contained in at least one segment, there exists one color which belongs to exactly one segment containing $t$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of warriors stationed by Simurgh.\n- The next $n$ lines each contain two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 10^9$) -- the start and end times of the warrior's watch segment.\n\nThe sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Output the minimum number of colors $k$ needed.\n- Then, output a line of $n$ integers $c_i$ ($1 \\leq c_i \\leq k$), where each $c_i$ is the color assigned to the $i$-th warrior.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 7\n\n5 10\n\n6 9\n\n5\n\n1 5\n\n2 6\n\n3 7\n\n4 7\n\n6 7\n\n5\n\n4 9\n\n8 17\n\n2 15\n\n12 19\n\n6 13\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n1 2 2 1 2\n2\n1 2 2 2 1\n3\n1 1 2 3 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nWe can represent each warrior's watch segment as an interval on the X-axis;\n\nIn test case 1, the intervals can be colored as shown below (intervals are colored with the selected color; areas are colored if this color occurs exactly once at this point in time):\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/80b63ec750df7a5ab4b27f062adbfc97cf959e1f.png)\n\nIn test case 2, the intervals can be colored as shown below:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/95b4a26427875e70e36b805f77a4b0b38af8c984.png)\n\nIn test case 3, the intervals can be colored as shown below:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6699aab3b108808e3576916130d839f91a86c1f7.png)",

The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the minimum length of the arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nIris treasures an integer array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is, $\\max(\\lvert a_i\\rvert) \\leq \\sum a_i$.\n\nIris defines the boredom of an array as its maximum subarray$^{\\text{∗}}$ sum.\n\nIris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ as a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ should have the following properties.\n\n- $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ should be a subsequence$^{\\text{†}}$ of $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$.\n- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$.\n- The boredom of $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ is the smallest possible.\n- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $b$ (i.e., $m$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!\n\nEven constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to compute the value of $\\boldsymbol{m}$ of any array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ satisfying all the conditions above. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.\n\nNote: since the input is large, you may need to optimize it for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\n```\n`int main() {<br/>    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);<br/>    std::cin.tie(nullptr); std::cout.tie(nullptr);<br/>}<br/>````\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$An array $c$ is a subarray of an array $d$ if $c$ can be obtained from $d$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A sequence $c$ is a subsequence of a sequence $d$ if $c$ can be obtained from $d$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The rabbit hole can be modeled as a tree$^{\\text{∗}}$ which has an exit at vertex $1$, and Alice starts at some vertex $v$. She wants to get out of the hole, but unfortunately, the Queen of Hearts has ordered her execution.\n\nEach minute, a fair coin is flipped.

As he spent several hours walking around it, gathering his strength, he noticed something curious: the spruce is actually a tree$^{\\text{∗}}$ -- and not just any tree, but one consisting of an odd number of vertices $n$. Moreover, on $n-1$ of the vertices hang Christmas ornaments, painted in exactly $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ distinct colors, with exactly two ornaments painted in each color. The remaining vertex, as tradition dictates, holds the tree's topper.\n\nAt last, after several days of mental preparation, Polycarp began dismantling the spruce. First, he removed the topper and had already started taking apart some branches when suddenly a natural question struck him: how can he remove one of the tree's edges and rearrange the ornaments in such a way that the sum of the lengths of the simple paths between ornaments of the same color is as large as possible?\n\nIn this problem, removing an edge from the tree is defined as follows: choose a pair of adjacent vertices $a$ and $b$ ($a < b$), then remove vertex $b$ from the tree and reattach all of $b$'s adjacent vertices (except for $a$) directly to $a$.\n\nPolycarp cannot continue dismantling his spruce until he gets an answer to this question. However, checking all possible options would take him several more years. Knowing your experience in competitive programming, he turned to you for help. But can you solve this dispute?\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an odd number $n$ ($3 \\le n < 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $n-1$ lines describe the tree, given by pairs of adjacent vertices $u$, $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n, u \\neq v$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, you need to output two lines.\n\nIn the first line, output the pair of vertices $u$, $v$, the edge between which Polycarp is going to remove.\n\nIn the next line, output the array $c$ of $n$ numbers from $0$ to $\\frac{n-1}{2}$, where $c[i]$ -- the positive color number assigned to vertex $i$. Note that $c[\\text{max}(u, v)]= 0$, since this vertex has been removed.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n2 4\n\n4 5\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n7\n\n1 5\n\n5 4\n\n4 3\n\n3 2\n\n2 6\n\n6 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2\n2 0 1 1 2\n1 5\n1 1 2 2 0\n4 3\n1 3 3 0 2 2 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nConsider the first test case.\n\nRemove the edge connecting vertices $1$ and $2$.

Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:\n\n1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.\n2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.\n3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYou are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.\n\nYou need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.\n\nIn this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $n$ ($3 \\leq n < 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n \\bmod 3 = 0$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.\n\nOtherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.\n\nA sequence of operations is described by $\\frac{n}{3}$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $c$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $p$ is the position at which the letter $c$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string \"YDX\" with $p=3$, the result is \"YDXD\", and with $p=0$, it is \"DYDX\". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.\n\nThe operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\nYDX\n\nYDXDYX\n\nYDX\n\nDYYDXYXYX\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYDX\nX 0 D 0 Y 0\nYES\nYDXDYX\nX 0 Y 0 D 1\nX 2 D 3 Y 4\nYES\nYDX\nY 0 D 1 X 2\nNO```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the second example, the string is transformed like this: $\"\" \\to \\mathtt{YDX} \\to \\mathtt{YDXDYX}$.",

The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1\\le n,m\\le 5000$, $\\color{red}{n\\cdot m\\le 2\\cdot 10^4}$, $1\\le k\\le 10^5$) -- the length of the array $a$, the maximum number of operations, and the number you add to $a_i$ each time, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ ($1\\le a_i\\le 10^5$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n\\cdot m$ over all tests does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $m$ integers in a single line, the $p$-th integer denoting the minimum possible variance of $a$ when exactly $p$ operations are performed, multiplied by $n^2$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n3 2 1\n\n1 2 2\n\n3 2 2\n\n1 2 2\n\n10 2 1\n\n10 1 1 1 1 10 1 1 1 1\n\n6 8 2\n\n1 1 4 5 1 3\n\n8 8 7\n\n20 43 24 2 4 3 20 43\n\n8 8 3\n\n20 43 24 2 4 3 20 43\n\n10 12 1\n\n5 3 3 5 4 1 8 1 1 1\n\n13 10 100000\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 4\n\n10 5 10000\n\n2308 9982 4435 3310 100000 9 7 8100 1919 100000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 0\n2 2\n1161 1024\n53 21 21 5 5 5 5 5\n10608 6912 4448 3104 1991 1312 535 304\n13248 11184 9375 7815 6447 5319 4383 3687\n385 316 269 224 181 156 124 101 80 56 41 29\n1486 1486 1486 1486 1486 1486 1486 1486 1486 1486\n134618047140 119919447140 107020847140 93922247140 82623647140\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n- For $p = 1$, you can perform the operation on $[1, 1]$, changing $a$ from $[1, 2, 2]$ to $[2, 2, 2]$. Since all of the elements are equal, the variance is equal to $0$.\n- For $p = 2$, you can perform the operation on $[1, 3]$ and then $[1, 1]$, changing $a$ from $[1, 2, 2]$ to $[2, 3, 3]$ to $[3, 3, 3]$. Since all of the elements are equal, the variance is equal to $0$.\n\nIn the second test case, some possible optimal choices are:\n\n- $p=1$: $[\\underline{1,}\\,2,2]\\to [3,2,2]$;\n- $p=2$: $[1,\\underline{2,2}] \\to [\\underline{1,}\\,4,4] \\to [3,4,4]$.\n\nIn the third test case, some possible optimal choices are:\n\n- $p=1$: $[10,\\underline{1,1,1,1,10,1,1,1,1}]\\to[10,2,2,2,2,11,2,2,2,2]$;\n- $p=2$: $[10,1,1,1,1,10,\\underline{1,1,1,1}] \\to [10,\\underline{1,1,1,1},10,2,2,2,2] \\to [10,2,2,2,2,10,2,2,2,2]$.\n\nIn the eighth test case, the optimal choice for all $p$ is to perform the operation on the whole array $p$ times.",

For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n4\n\ns.sp\n\n6\n\npss..s\n\n5\n\nppppp\n\n2\n\nsp\n\n4\n\n.sp.\n\n8\n\npsss....\n\n1\n\n.\n\n8\n\npspspsps\n\n20\n\n....................\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, one permutation that works is $p = [3, 4, 1, 2]$. The restrictions are as follows:\n\n- $s_1 =$ s: $[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [3, 4, 1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n- $s_2 =$ .: No additional restriction.\n- $s_3 =$ s: $[p_3, p_4] = [1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n- $s_4 =$ p: $[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [3, 4, 1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation that satisfies all restrictions.\n\nFor the third test case, one permutation that satisfies the constraints is $p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$.",

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the time limit and the constraints on $n$ and $q$ are higher. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nGellyfish has an array consisting of $n$ sets. Initially, all the sets are empty.\n\nNow Gellyfish will do $q$ operations. Each operation contains one modification operation and one query operation, for the $i$-th ($1 \\leq i \\leq q$) operation:\n\nFirst, there will be a modification operation, which is one of the following:\n\n1. Insert operation: You are given an integer $r$. For the $1$-th to $r$-th sets, insert element $i$. Note that the element inserted here is $i$, the index of the operation, not the index of the set.\n2. Reverse operation: You are given an integer $r$. Reverse the $1$-th to $r$-th sets.\n3. Delete operation: You are given an integer $x$. Delete element $x$ from all sets that contain $x$.\n\nFollowed by a query operation:\n\n- Query operation: You are given an integer $p$. Output the smallest element in the $p$-th set (If the $p$-th set is empty, the answer is considered to be $0$).\n\nNow, Flower needs to provide the answer for each query operation. Please help her!\n\nAdditional constraint on the problem: Gellyfish will only give the next operation after Flower has answered the previous query operation. That is, you need to solve this problem online. Please refer to the input format for more details.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of the sets and the number of operations.\n\nAs you need to respond to the operations online, the operations will be encoded.\n\nThe $i$-th line of the following $q$ lines contains three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($1 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $1 \\leq c \\leq n$) -- describing the $i$-th operation in an encoded form.\n\nHere, $a$ represents the type of modification operation. Among them, $a=1$ represents Insert operation, $a=2$ represents Reverse operation, $a=3$ represents Delete operation.\n\n- If $a = 1$, then the modification operation is the Insert operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq n$. $r$ will be calculated as $r=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n- If $a=2$, then the modification operation is the Reverse operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq n$. $r$ will be calculated as $r=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n- If $a=3$, then the modification operation is the Delete operation. It will be guaranteed that $1 \\leq b \\leq q$. $x$ will be calculated as $x=(b+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod q + 1$.\n\nFor the query operation, $p$ will be calculated as $p = (c+\\text{ans}_{i-1}-1) \\bmod n + 1$.\n\nHere $ \\text{ans}_{i} (1 \\leq i \\leq q)$ represents the answer to the query operation in the $i$-th operation. Additionally, we define $ \\text{ans}_{0} = 0$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query operation, output the answer to the query.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5 10\n\n1 2 2\n\n2 3 1\n\n1 5 3\n\n2 2 5\n\n1 5 2\n\n2 4 4\n\n3 2 2\n\n3 1 2\n\n3 10 5\n\n3 2 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n0\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\n5\n0\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nAll the sets are empty in the beginning, so the array is $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$.\n\nWith the decoding method given before, we can see what happens in each operation:\n\n01. For the first operation: $a = 1, r = 2, p = 2$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $1$ is inserted into the first two sets; so the array becomes $[\\{1\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $1$.\n02. For the second operation: $a = 2, r = 4, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first four sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the second set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n03. For the third operation: $a = 1, r = 5, p = 3$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $3$ is inserted into all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the third set is $1$.\n04. For the fourth operation: $a = 2, r = 3, p = 1$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first three sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the first set is $1$.\n05. For the fifth operation: $a = 1, r = 1, p = 3$. The modification operation is an Insert operation; element $5$ is inserted into the first set; so the array becomes $[\\{1, 3, 5\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the third set is $3$.\n06. For the sixth operation: $a = 2, r = 2, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Reverse operation; the first two sets are reversed; so the array becomes $[\\{3\\}, \\{1, 3, 5\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{3\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $1$.\n07. For the seventh operation: $a = 3, x = 3, p = 3$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $3$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the third set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n08. For the eighth operation: $a = 3, x = 1, p = 2$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $1$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{5\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the smallest element in the second set is $5$.\n09. For the ninth operation: $a = 3, x = 5, p = 5$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $5$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the fifth set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n10. For the tenth operation: $a = 3, x = 2, p = 4$. The modification operation is a Delete operation; element $2$ is deleted from all the sets; so the array becomes $[\\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}, \\{\\}]$, and the fourth set is empty, which means the answer is $0$.\n\nPlease note that although we have not inserted element $2$ into the sets, we still delete element $2$ from all the sets in the tenth operation, which means that the Delete operation doesn't necessarily require the existence of a set to contain the deleted element. It also shows that it is possible to have two Delete operations that delete the same element.",

The statement has been corrected to a solvable version. In the official round, all submissions to this problem have been removed.\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the sum of value of different arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nIris treasures an integer array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is, $\\max(\\lvert a_i\\rvert) \\leq \\sum a_i$.\n\nIris defines the boredom of an array as its maximum subarray$^{\\text{∗}}$ sum.\n\nIris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ as a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ should have the following properties.\n\n- $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ should be a subsequence$^{\\text{†}}$ of $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$.\n- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$.\n- The boredom of $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ is the smallest possible.\n- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $b$ (i.e., $m$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!\n\nFor a possible array $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ satisfying all the conditions above, Victor defines the value of the array as the number of occurrences of array $a$ as subsequences in array $b$. That is, he counts the number of array $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{n}$ that $1\\le c_1< c_2< \\ldots< c_n\\le m$ and for all integer $i$ that $1\\le i\\le n$, $b_{c_{i}}=a_i$ is satisfied, and let this be the value of array $b$.\n\nEven constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to calculate the sum of value of all possible arrays $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$. Since the answer may be large, Victor only needs the number modulo $998\\,244\\,353$. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$An array $c$ is a subarray of an array $d$ if $c$ can be obtained from $d$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A sequence $c$ is a subsequence of a sequence $d$ if $c$ can be obtained from $d$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Both arrays have value $1$.\n\nIn the third test case, $a=[1, -2, 2, 1]$. The only possible array $b$ is $[1, 1, -2, 2, -1, 1]$. It has value $2$, because we can find arrays $c=[1,3,4,6]$ or $[2,3,4,6]$. That is, the array $a$ occurs twice in $b$, so the answer is $2$.",

The construction manager, Penchick, ordered a state-of-the-art monument to be built with $n$ pillars.\n\nThe heights of the monument's pillars can be represented as an array $h$ of $n$ positive integers, where $h_i$ represents the height of the $i$-th pillar for all $i$ between $1$ and $n$.\n\nPenchick wants the heights of the pillars to be in non-decreasing order, i.e. $h_i \\le h_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ between $1$ and $n - 1$. However, due to confusion, the monument was built such that the heights of the pillars are in non-increasing order instead, i.e. $h_i \\ge h_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ between $1$ and $n - 1$.\n\nLuckily, Penchick can modify the monument and do the following operation on the pillars as many times as necessary:\n\n- Modify the height of a pillar to any positive integer. Formally, choose an index $1\\le i\\le n$ and a positive integer $x$. Then, assign $h_i := x$.\n\nHelp Penchick determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the monument's pillars non-decreasing.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$) -- the number of pillars.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le n$ and $h_i\\ge h_{i+1}$) -- the height of the pillars.\n\nPlease take note that the given array $h$ is non-increasing.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n3\n\n2 2 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the initial heights of pillars are $h = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$.\n\n- In the first operation, Penchick changes the height of pillar $1$ to $h_1 := 2$.\n- In the second operation, he changes the height of pillar $2$ to $h_2 := 2$.\n- In the third operation, he changes the height of pillar $4$ to $h_4 := 4$.\n- In the fourth operation, he changes the height of pillar $5$ to $h_5 := 4$.\n\nAfter the operation, the heights of the pillars are $h = [2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$, which is non-decreasing. It can be proven that it is not possible for Penchick to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing in fewer than $4$ operations.\n\nIn the second test case, Penchick can make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing by modifying the height of pillar $3$ to $h_3 := 2$.\n\nIn the third test case, the heights of pillars are already non-decreasing, so no operations are required.",

Then the element $1$ will be added to the beginning of the first array, and the value of $x$ will become $6$. The last element will be removed, and the first array will look like $[1, 2]$. Next, the element $x$ is added to the beginning of the second array, and the value of $x$ becomes $4$. The last element of the second array is removed, and both arrays look like $[1, 2]$ and $[6, 3]$ respectively after the first operation.\n- Apply the operation to the second array with $x = 8$. Then the first array remains unchanged, and both arrays will look like $[1, 2]$ and $[8, 6]$ respectively.\n- Apply the operation to the second array with $x = 7$, then both arrays will have the required appearance $[1, 2]$ and $[7, 8]$ respectively.\n\nIn the second test case, the desired array can only be achieved in $5$ operations.\n\nIn the third test case, the following sequence of $3$ operations is suitable:\n\n- Apply the operation with $x = 11$ to the first array.\n- Apply the operation with $x = 12$ to the second array.\n- Apply the operation with $x = 13$ to the third array.",

You know that\n\n1. Its words consist only of the first $c$ letters of the Latin alphabet.\n2. Each word has a case which can be unambiguously determined by its last letter (different letters correspond to different cases). For example, words \"ABACABA\" and \"ABA\" (if they exist) have the same case in this language because they both have the same ending 'A', whereas \"ALICE\" and \"BOB\" have different cases. If the language does not have a case corresponding to some letter, it means that the word cannot end with this letter.\n3. The length of each word is $k$ or less.\n\nYou have a single text written in this language. Unfortunately, as the language is really ancient, spaces between words are missing and all letters are uppercase. You wonder what is the minimum number of cases the language can have. Can you find this out?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$) -- the number of test cases. It is followed by descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $c$, $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2^{18}$, $1 \\le c \\le 18$) -- the length of the text, the number of letters in the language, and the maximum length of the word.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $n$ characters -- the text itself. Each character is one of the first $c$ uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{18}$ and the sum of $2^c$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{18}$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single line consisting of a single integer -- the minimum number of cases in the language.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n5 5 1\n\nABCDE\n\n3 1 2\n\nAAA\n\n3 2 2\n\nAAB\n\n10 2 2\n\nABABABABAB\n\n4 4 4\n\nDCBA\n\n1 17 1\n\nQ\n\n9 3 2\n\nABCABCABC\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there must be five cases in the language (for each of the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' there must be a case that has a corresponding ending).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one case with ending 'B' is sufficient.",

Some practice swimming, some rowing, and some rock climbing!\n\nMaster Igor is a prominent figure in the local rock climbing community. One day, he went on a mountain hike to ascend one of the peaks. As an experienced climber, Igor decided not to follow the established trails but to use his skills to climb strictly vertically.\n\nIgor found a rectangular vertical section of the mountain and mentally divided it into $n$ horizontal levels. He then split each level into $m$ segments using vertical partitions. Upon inspecting these segments, Igor discovered convenient protrusions that can be grasped (hereafter referred to as holds). Thus, the selected part of the mountain can be represented as an $n \\times m$ rectangle, with some cells containing holds.\n\nBeing an experienced programmer, Igor decided to count the number of valid routes. A route is defined as a sequence of distinct holds. A route is considered valid if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- The first hold in the route is located on the very bottom level (row $n$);\n- The last hold in the route is located on the very top level (row $1$);\n- Each subsequent hold is not lower than the previous one;\n- At least one hold is used on each level (i.e., in every row of the rectangle);\n- At most two holds are used on each level (since Igor has only two hands);\n- Igor can reach from the current hold to the next one if the distance between the centers of the corresponding sections does not exceed Igor's arm span.\n\nIgor's arm span is $d$, which means he can move from one hold to another if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the corresponding segments does not exceed $d$. The distance between sections ($i_1, j_1$) and ($i_2, j_2$) is given by $\\sqrt{(i_1 - i_2) ^ 2 + (j_1 - j_2) ^ 2}$.\n\nCalculate the number of different valid routes. Two routes are considered different if they differ in the list of holds used or in the order in which these holds are visited.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, $d$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2000$, $1 \\leq m, d \\leq 2000$).\n\nEach of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ characters -- the description of the corresponding level of the mountain. The symbol '#' represents an empty section, and the symbol 'X' represents a section with a hold. The levels are described from top to bottom.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of different routes modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3 4 1\n\nXX#X\n\n#XX#\n\n#X#X\n\n3 4 2\n\nXX#X\n\n#XX#\n\n#X#X\n\n3 1 3\n\nX\n\nX\n\n#\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n60\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nPossible routes in the first case:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4abfb72944041c37716a0906437d686506431681.png)\n\nIn the second example, Igor's arm span has become larger, so new routes are available to him, for example this one:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5d1a6871d19f072dc888770deff1f3cb1426148b.png)\n\nIn the third example, there are no holds on the lower level, so there are no correct routes.",

When the $i$-th operation is applied, the variable $x_i$ gets assigned the following value: $\\min(a_{x_i}, a_{y_i} + z_i)$.\n\nEvery operation will be applied exactly once, but their order is not fixed; they can be applied in any order.\n\nLet's call a sequence of initial variable values $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ stable, if no matter in which order we apply operations, the resulting values will be the same. If the resulting value of the $i$-th variable depends on the order of operations, then the sequence of initial variable values is called $i$-unstable.\n\nYou have to process $q$ queries. In each query, you will be given initial values $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ and an integer $k$; before applying the operations, you can at most $k$ times choose a variable and decrease it by $1$.

If the initial variable values are $[20, 0, 15, 5]$, the resulting values will be $[6, 0, 5, 5]$ with any order of operations. Decreasing the variables $10$ times is not enough. However, if we can apply no more than $30$ changes, we can decrease the $1$-st variable by $2$, and the $4$-th variable by $25$, we get initial values equal to $[18, 0, 15, -20]$, and this sequence is $2$-unstable and $3$-unstable:\n\n- if you apply the operations in the order they are given, you will get $[-12, 0, 5, -20]$;\n- however, if you apply the operations in order $[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]$, you will get $[-12, -2, 5, -20]$;\n- and if you apply the operations in order $[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$, you will get $[-12, -2, 3, -20]$.",

To test this, Reyhaneh asks [Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi) for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.\n\nNote that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.\n\nAn integer linearly combination of $a_1, \\ldots, a_k$ is any sum of the form $c_1 \\cdot a_1 + c_2 \\cdot a_2 + \\ldots + c_k \\cdot a_k$ where $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$ are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$), the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$), the size of the set. The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$).\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nIn the first line of each test case print the size of the largest integer linearly independent subset.\n\nIn the next line, print one such subset in any order. If there are multiple valid subsets, print any one of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\n12 15 21 30 35\n\n3\n\n2 3 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n4 6\n3\n35 21 30\n2\n2 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn example 1, $\\{4, 6\\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset. It can be proven that there is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $3$ elements.\n\nIn example 2, $\\{35, 21, 30\\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset because no integer linear combination of any two elements can create the third. There is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $4$ elements.\n\nIn example 3, $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is not an integer linearly independent subset since $6$ can be written as $6 \\cdot 2 + (-2) \\cdot 3$, which is an integer linear combination of $\\{2, 3\\}$.",

However, since we need to additionally minimise the final length of the array, we must output the second option with $l=r=1$. Note that the first option of doing nothing is incorrect, since it has a longer final length.\n\nIn the second testcase, no subarray is selected, so after which $a$ is still $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$. This has length $5$ and $1$ distinct element, so it has a score of $5 - 1 = 4$. This can be proven to be a shortest array which maximises the score.\n\nIn the third testcase, the subarray selected is $[2, \\color{red}1, \\color{red}3, 2]$, after which $a$ becomes $[2, 2]$. This has length $2$ and $1$ distinct element, so it has a score of $2 - 1 = 1$. This can be proven to be a shortest array which maximises the score.",

There are a total of $n$ groups and $m$ classrooms in the faculty. It is also known that each group has exactly $6$ classes on the first day, and the $k$-th class of each group takes place at the same time. Each class must be held in a classroom, and at the same time, there cannot be classes for more than one group in the same classroom.\n\nEach classroom has its own index (at least three digits), and all digits of this index, except for the last two, indicate the floor on which the classroom is located. For example, classroom $479$ is located on the $4$-th floor, while classroom $31415$ is on the $314$-th floor. Between floors, one can move by stairs; for any floor $x > 1$, one can either go down to floor $x - 1$ or go up to floor $x + 1$; from the first floor, one can only go up to the second; from the floor $10^7$ (which is the last one), it is possible to go only to the floor $9999999$.\n\nThe faculty's dean's office has decided to create the schedule in such a way that students move as much as possible between floors, meaning that the total number of movements between floors across all groups should be maximized.

There are also $n$ buttons on the machine, each button corresponds to a slot, with exactly one button corresponding to each slot. Unfortunately, the labels on the buttons have worn off, so you do not know which button corresponds to which slot.\n\nWhen you press the button corresponding to the $i$-th slot, one of two events occurs:\n\n- If there is a can of lemonade in the $i$-th slot, it will drop out and you will take it. At this point, the number of cans in the $i$-th slot decreases by $1$.\n- If there are no cans of lemonade left in the $i$-th slot, nothing will drop out.\n\nAfter pressing, the can drops out so quickly that it is impossible to track from which slot it fell. The contents of the slots are hidden from your view, so you cannot see how many cans are left in each slot. The only thing you know is the initial number of cans in the slots: $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least $k$ cans of lemonade.\n\nNote that you can adapt your strategy during the button presses based on whether you received a can or not.

Note that if we simply press one button twice, we might not be lucky, and that button could correspond to the first slot, in which case we would only receive $1$ can of lemonade for two presses.\n\nIn the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is as follows:\n\nPress the first button twice. After the first press, a can of lemonade will definitely drop out. Then there are two options:\n\n- If no can of lemonade drops after the second press, we know that this button must correspond to the second slot, since $a_2 = 1$ and $a_1, a_3 > 1$. Then we can press the second button twice and the third button once. Since $a_1, a_3 \\geq 2$, we will definitely receive three cans of lemonade for these three presses. Thus, after $5$ presses, we will have $4$ cans of lemonade.\n- If a can of lemonade drops after the second press, we can make one press on the second button and one press on the third button. After each of these presses, we will definitely receive a can of lemonade. Thus, after $4$ presses, we will have $4$ cans of lemonade.\n\nIt can be shown that it is impossible to guarantee receiving $4$ cans of lemonade with only $4$ presses, so the answer is $5$.",

The vertices in the tree are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and the root is the vertex $1$. Let $d_x$ be the distance (the number of edges on the shortest path) from the root to the vertex $x$.\n\nThere is a chip that is initially placed at the root.

In the two versions, the constraints on $q$ and the time limit are different. In this version, $q=0$. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.\n\nA team consisting of $n$ members, numbered from $1$ to $n$, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains $m$ slides.\n\nThere is an array $a$ of length $n$. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide $1$ to slide $m$. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is $[\\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$. After member $3$ presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either $[\\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$, $[1,\\color{red}{3},2,4]$, $[1,2,\\color{red}{3},4]$ or $[1,2,4,\\color{red}{3}]$.\n\nThere is also an array $b$ of length $m$. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member $b_i$ present slide $i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $m$ under these constraints.\n\nHowever, your annoying boss wants to make $q$ updates to the array $b$. In the $i$-th update, he will choose a slide $s_i$ and a member $t_i$ and set $b_{s_i} := t_i$. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array $b$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nFor each of the $q+1$ states of array $b$, the initial state and after each of the $q$ updates, determine if the slideshow is good.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $q=0$) -- the number of members, the number of sections and the number of updates.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the initial order of the members from front to back. It is guaranteed that each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once in $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the members who should present each section.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q+1$ lines corresponding to the $q+1$ states of the array $b$. Output \"YA\" if the slide show is good, and \"TIDAK\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yA\", \"Ya\", \"ya\", and \"YA\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4 2 0\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 1\n\n3 6 0\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 2 3 3 2\n\n4 6 0\n\n3 1 4 2\n\n3 1 1 2 3 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYA\nYA\nTIDAK\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, you do not need to move the members as both slides are presented by member $1$, who is already at the front of the line.\n\nFor the second test case, the following is a possible way to move members so that the presentation is good:\n\n1. $[1,2,3]$, do not move member $1$.\n2. $[1,2,3]$, move member $1$ after member $3$.\n3. $[2,3,1]$, move member $2$ after member $3$.\n4. $[3,2,1]$, do not move member $3$.\n5. $[3,2,1]$, move member $3$ after member $1$.\n6. $[2,1,3]$, do not move member $2$.",

And like ever before, Iris has set a problem to which she gave a wrong solution, but Chris is always supposed to save it! You are going to play the role of Chris now:\n\n- Chris is given two arrays $a$ and $b$, both consisting of $n$ integers.\n- Iris is interested in the largest possible value of $P = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n \\min(a_i, b_i)$ after an arbitrary rearrangement of $b$. Note that she only wants to know the maximum value of $P$, and no actual rearrangement is performed on $b$.\n- There will be $q$ modifications. Each modification can be denoted by two integers $o$ and $x$ ($o$ is either $1$ or $2$, $1 \\leq x \\leq n$). If $o = 1$, then Iris will increase $a_x$ by $1$; otherwise, she will increase $b_x$ by $1$.\n- Iris asks Chris the maximum value of $P$ for $q + 1$ times: once before any modification, then after every modification.\n- Since $P$ might be huge, Chris only needs to calculate it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\nChris soon worked out this problem, but he was so tired that he fell asleep. Besides saying thanks to Chris, now it is your turn to write a program to calculate the answers for given input data.\n\nNote: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\n```\n`int main() {<br/>    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);<br/>    std::cin.tie(nullptr); std::cout.tie(nullptr);<br/>}<br/>````\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq q \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the array and the number of operations.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 5\\cdot 10^8$) -- the array $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\leq b_i \\leq 5\\cdot 10^8$) -- the array $b$.\n\nThen $q$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $o$ and $x$ ($o \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, $1 \\leq x \\leq n$), representing an operation.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $4\\cdot 10^5$, respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q + 1$ integers in a line, representing the answers that Chris will calculate, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 4\n\n1 1 2\n\n3 2 1\n\n1 3\n\n2 3\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\n6 8\n\n1 4 2 7 3 5\n\n7 6 5 6 3 3\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n1 5\n\n1 5\n\n1 5\n\n2 3\n\n2 3\n\n1 6\n\n13 8\n\n7 7 6 6 5 5 5 2 2 3 4 5 1\n\n1 4 1 9 6 6 9 1 5 1 3 8 4\n\n2 2\n\n2 11\n\n2 4\n\n2 4\n\n1 7\n\n1 1\n\n2 12\n\n1 5\n\n5 3\n\n10000000 20000000 30000000 40000000 50000000\n\n10000000 20000000 30000000 40000000 50000000\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2 3 3 6 6\n840 840 1008 1344 1680 2016 2016 2016 2352\n2116800 2646000 3528000 3528000 3528000 4233600 4838400 4838400 4838400\n205272023 205272023 205272023 264129429\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n- Before the modifications, Chris can rearrange $b$ to $[1, 2, 3]$ so that $P = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n \\min(a_i, b_i) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$. We can prove that this is the maximum possible value. For example, if Chris rearranges $b = [2, 3, 1]$, $P$ will be equal $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 < 2$, which is not optimal.\n- After the first modification, Chris can rearrange $b$ to $[1, 2, 3]$ so that $P = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$, which is maximized.\n- After the second modification, Chris can rearrange $b$ to $[2, 2, 3]$ so that $P = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$, which is maximized.\n- After the third modification, Chris can rearrange $b$ to $[2, 2, 3]$ so that $P = 6$, which is maximized.\n- After the fourth modification, Chris can rearrange $b$ to $[2, 2, 4]$ so that $P = 6$, which is maximized.",

Let $k$ be the number of 1s in $s$. We will construct a complete undirected weighted graph with $k$ vertices as follows:\n\n- For each $1\\le i\\le n$ with $s_i = \\mathtt{1}$, create a vertex labeled $i$.\n- For any two vertices labeled $u$ and $v$ that are created in the above step, define the edge weight between them $w(u, v)$ as the distance$^{\\text{∗}}$ between vertex $u$ and vertex $v$ in the tree $T$.\n\nA simple path$^{\\text{†}}$ that visits vertices labeled $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_m$ in this order is nice if for all $1\\le i\\le m - 2$, the condition $2\\cdot w(v_i, v_{i + 1})\\le w(v_{i + 1}, v_{i + 2})$ holds. In other words, the weight of each edge in the path must be at least twice the weight of the previous edge.

Steve wishes to sort the permutation $p$.\n\nSteve has an infinite supply of coloured sand blocks, and using them he discovered a physics-based way to sort an array of numbers called gravity sort. Namely, to perform gravity sort on $p$, Steve will do the following:\n\n- For all $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le n$, place a sand block of color $c_i$ in position $(i, j)$ for all $j$ where $1 \\le j \\le p_i$. Here, position $(x, y)$ denotes a cell in the $x$-th row from the top and $y$-th column from the left.\n- Apply downwards gravity to the array, so that all sand blocks fall as long as they can fall.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/bc9da7db75c1cd76ae4b448579a882a11a989364.png)An example of gravity sort for the third testcase. $p = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]$, $c = [2, 1, 4, 1, 5]$\n\nAlex looks at Steve's sand blocks after performing gravity sort and wonders how many pairs of arrays $(p',c')$ where $p'$ is a permutation would have resulted in the same layout of sand. Note that the original pair of arrays $(p, c)$ will always be counted.\n\nPlease calculate this for Alex. As this number could be large, output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order.

To do this, they ask you to rearrange the characters in the string $s$ so that the value of the number represented by the string $s$ is maximized.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A subsequence of a string $a$ is a string $b$ that can be obtained by deleting several (possibly $0$) characters from $a$.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, $t \\le 1000$, $n \\le 5000$ and the sum of $n$ does not exceed $5000$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nFor a non-empty sequence $c$ of length $k$, define $f(c)$ as follows:\n\n- Turtle and Piggy are playing a game on a sequence. They are given the sequence $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the third, etc.).\n- The game goes as follows:\n- Let the current length of the sequence be $m$. If $m = 1$, the game ends.\n- If the game does not end and it's Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m - 1$, set $c_i$ to $\\min(c_i, c_{i + 1})$, and remove $c_{i + 1}$.\n- If the game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m - 1$, set $c_i$ to $\\max(c_i, c_{i + 1})$, and remove $c_{i + 1}$.\n- Turtle wants to maximize the value of $c_1$ in the end, while Piggy wants to minimize the value of $c_1$ in the end.\n- $f(c)$ is the value of $c_1$ in the end if both players play optimally.\n\nFor a permutation $p$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$, Turtle defines the beauty of the permutation as $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n \\sum\\limits_{j = i}^n f([p_i, p_{i + 1}, \\ldots, p_j])$ (i.e., the sum of $f(c)$ where $c$ is a non-empty subsegment$^{\\text{†}}$ of $p$).\n\nPiggy gives Turtle a permutation $a$ of length $n$ where some elements are missing and represented by $0$.\n\nTurtle asks you to determine a permutation $b$ of length $n$ such that:\n\n- $b$ can be formed by filling in the missing elements of $a$ (i.e., for all $1 \\le i \\le n$, if $a_i \\ne 0$, then $b_i = a_i$).\n- The beauty of the permutation $b$ is maximized.\n\nFor convenience, you only need to find the maximum beauty of such permutation $b$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A sequence $a$ is a subsegment of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that the elements of $a$ that are not $0$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum beauty of the permutation $b$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n0 0 0\n\n3\n\n0 1 0\n\n5\n\n3 2 4 5 1\n\n7\n\n0 3 2 5 0 0 0\n\n10\n\n1 2 6 5 8 9 0 0 0 0\n\n5\n\n0 4 1 0 0\n\n5\n\n0 1 5 2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n12\n11\n44\n110\n300\n45\n40\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the permutation $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[1, 2]$. The beauty of $[1, 2]$ is $4$ since $f([1]) + f([2]) + f([1, 2]) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. If $c = [1, 2]$, then $f(c) = 1$ since Turtle can only choose $i = 1$ and he will set $c_1$ to $\\min(c_1, c_2) = 1$.\n\nIn the second test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[3, 2, 1]$. The beauty of $[3, 2, 1]$ is $12$ since $f([3]) + f([2]) + f([1]) + f([3, 2]) + f([2, 1]) + f([3, 2, 1]) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 12$.\n\nIn the third test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[2, 1, 3]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, if $c = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]$, then $f(c) = 3$. One of the possible game processes is as follows:\n\n- Turtle can choose $i = 3$. Then he will set $c_3$ to $\\min(c_3, c_4) = 4$ and remove $c_4$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 2, 4, 1]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i = 1$. Then he will set $c_1$ to $\\max(c_1, c_2) = 3$ and remove $c_2$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 4, 1]$.\n- Turtle can choose $i = 2$. Then he will set $c_2$ to $\\min(c_2, c_3) = 1$ and remove $c_3$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 1]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i = 1$. Then he will set $c_1$ to $\\max(c_1, c_2) = 3$ and remove $c_2$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3]$.\n- The length of the sequence becomes $1$, so the game will end. The value of $c_1$ will be $3$ in the end.\n\nIn the fifth test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7]$.",

We decided to test this love. ErnKor will have to swim across a river with a width of $1$ meter and a length of $n$ meters.\n\nThe river is very cold. Therefore, in total (that is, throughout the entire swim from $0$ to $n+1$) ErnKor can swim in the water for no more than $k$ meters. For the sake of humanity, we have added not only crocodiles to the river, but also logs on which he can jump. Our test is as follows:\n\nInitially, ErnKor is on the left bank and needs to reach the right bank. They are located at the $0$ and $n+1$ meters respectively. The river can be represented as $n$ segments, each with a length of $1$ meter. Each segment contains either a log 'L', a crocodile 'C', or just water 'W'. ErnKor can move as follows:\n\n- If he is on the surface (i.e., on the bank or on a log), he can jump forward for no more than $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10$) meters (he can jump on the bank, on a log, or in the water).\n- If he is in the water, he can only swim to the next river segment (or to the bank if he is at the $n$-th meter).\n- ErnKor cannot land in a segment with a crocodile in any way.\n\nDetermine if ErnKor can reach the right bank.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)  -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three numbers $n, m, k$ ($0 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le m \\le 10$) -- the length of the river, the distance ErnKor can jump, and the number of meters ErnKor can swim without freezing.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $a$ of length $n$. $a_i$ denotes the object located at the $i$-th meter. ($a_i \\in \\{$'W','C','L'$\\}$)\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if ErnKor can pass the test, and output \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n6 2 0\n\nLWLLLW\n\n6 1 1\n\nLWLLLL\n\n6 1 1\n\nLWLLWL\n\n6 2 15\n\nLWLLCC\n\n6 10 0\n\nCCCCCC\n\n6 6 1\n\nWCCCCW\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's consider examples:\n\n- First example: We jump from the shore to the first log ($0 \\rightarrow 1$), from the first log to the second ($1 \\rightarrow 3$), from the second to the fourth ($3 \\rightarrow 5$), and from the last log to the shore ($5 \\rightarrow 7$). So, we have $0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 7$. Since we did not encounter a crocodile and swam no more than k meters, the answer is «YES».\n- Second example: $0 \\rightarrow 1$, we jump into the water from the first log ($1 \\rightarrow 2$), swim a cell to the log ($2 \\leadsto 3$), $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 7$. Since we did not encounter a crocodile and swam no more than k meters, the answer is «YES».\n- In the third example, ErnKor needs to swim two cells 'W', but can only swim one. Therefore, the answer is «NO».\n- Sixth example: We jump from the shore into the water ($0 \\rightarrow 6$) and swim one cell in the water ($6 \\leadsto 7$).

Recently, the KDOI Team has developed a new Online Judge called Forcescode.\n\nKevin has participated in $n$ contests on Forcescode. In the $i$-th contest, his performance rating is $a_i$.\n\nNow he has hacked into the backend of Forcescode and will select an interval $[l,r]$ ($1\\le l\\le r\\le n$), then skip all of the contests in this interval. After that, his rating will be recalculated in the following way:\n\n- Initially, his rating is $x=0$;\n- For each $1\\le i\\le n$, after the $i$-th contest,\n- If $l\\le i\\le r$, this contest will be skipped, and the rating will remain unchanged;\n- Otherwise, his rating will be updated according to the following rules:\n- If $a_i>x$, his rating $x$ will increase by $1$;\n- If $a_i=x$, his rating $x$ will remain unchanged;\n- If $a_i<x$, his rating $x$ will decrease by $1$.\n\nYou have to help Kevin to find his maximum possible rating after the recalculation if he chooses the interval $[l,r]$ optimally. Note that Kevin has to skip at least one contest.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The only difference is that you need to also output the number of optimal sequences in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.\n\nYou're given an array $a$ of length $n$, and an array $b$ of length $m$ ($b_i > b_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\le i < m$). Initially, the value of $k$ is $1$. Your aim is to make the array $a$ empty by performing one of these two operations repeatedly:\n\n- Type $1$ -- If the value of $k$ is less than $m$ and the array $a$ is not empty, you can increase the value of $k$ by $1$. This does not incur any cost.\n- Type $2$ -- You remove a non-empty prefix of array $a$, such that its sum does not exceed $b_k$. This incurs a cost of $m - k$.\n\nYou need to minimize the total cost of the operations to make array $a$ empty. If it's impossible to do this through any sequence of operations, output $-1$. Otherwise, output the minimum total cost of the operations, and the number of sequences of operations which yield this minimum cost modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nTwo sequences of operations are considered different if you choose a different type of operation at any step, or the size of the removed prefix is different at any step.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$).

The first should be the minimum total cost of the operations, and the second should be the number of sequences of operations which achieve this minimum cost, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nIf there is no possible sequence of operations which makes $a$ empty, then output a single integer $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n4 2\n\n9 3 4 3\n\n11 7\n\n1 2\n\n20\n\n19 18\n\n10 2\n\n2 5 2 1 10 3 2 9 9 6\n\n17 9\n\n10 11\n\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 1\n\n1 6\n\n10\n\n32 16 8 4 2 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 3\n-1\n2 11\n10 42\n4 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are $3$ optimal sequences of operations which yield a total cost of $1$:\n\n- All $3$ sequences begin with a type $2$ operation, removing the prefix $[9]$ to make $a = [3, 4, 3]$, incurring a cost of $1$. Then, we perform a type $1$ operation to increase the value of $k$ by $1$. All subsequent operations now incur a cost of $0$.\n- One sequence continues by removing the prefixes $[3, 4]$ then $[3]$.\n- Another sequence continues by removing the prefixes $[3]$ then $[4, 3]$.\n- Another sequence continues by removing the prefixes $[3]$ then $[4]$ then $[3]$.\n\nIn the second test case, it's impossible to remove any prefix of the array since $a_1 > b_1$, so array $a$ cannot be made empty by any sequence of operations.",

Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with $n$ vertices, with the root at vertex $1$. Each vertex of the tree has a number $a_i$ recorded, which represents the danger of vertex $i$. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nFor a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximumalternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex $i$ is defined as $a_i - a_{p_i} + a_{p_{p_i}} - \\ldots$, where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ on the path to the root (to vertex $1$).\n\nFor example, in the tree below, vertex $4$ has the following vertical paths:\n\n- $[4]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 = 6$;\n- $[4, 3]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 = 6 - 2 = 4$;\n- $[4, 3, 2]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$;\n- $[4, 3, 2, 1]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 6 - 2 + 5 - 4 = 5$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1d786fdded1f234d101767c2c7b55e98960c8af0.png)The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red.\n\nHelp Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe following describes the test cases.\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the dangers of the vertices.\n\nThe next $n - 1$ lines contain the numbers $v, u$ ($1 \\le v, u \\le n$, $v \\neq u$) -- the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to output a valid sequence of operations if one exists. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nKevin has an undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Initially, some vertices contain stones, which Kevin wants to move to new positions.\n\nKevin can perform the following operation:\n\n- For each stone at $u_i$, select a neighboring vertex $v_i$. Simultaneously move each stone from $u_i$ to its corresponding $v_i$.\n\nAt any time, each vertex can contain at most one stone.\n\nDetermine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that moves the stones from the initial state to the target state. Output a valid sequence of operations with no more than $2n$ moves if one exists. It can be proven that if a valid sequence exists, a valid sequence with no more than $2n$ moves exists.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1\\leq n \\leq 2000$, $0\\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 10^4)$) -- the number of vertices and edges in the graph.\n\nThe second line contains a binary string $s$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $i$-th bit of $s$ indicates the number of stones on the $i$-th vertex in the initial state.\n\nThe third line contains a binary string $t$ consisting of '0' and '1'.

There are no self-loops and parallel edges in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the numbers of '1' in $s$ and $t$ are the same.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, on the first line, output \"Yes\" or \"No\" to indicate whether a valid sequence of operations exists.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\nIf a valid sequence of operations exists, output a single integer $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 2n$) on the second line, representing the number of operations. Suppose there are $c$ stones in the initial state. The next $k + 1$ lines should each contain distinct $c$ integers, representing the positions of the stones before the operations and after each operation. These positions should satisfy the following:\n\n- The positions of the stones in the first line match the initial state from the input, in any order.\n- The positions of the stones in the last line match the target state from the input, in any order.\n- For all $i$ ($1\\leq i\\leq k$) and $j$ ($1\\leq j\\leq c$), ensure that the $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line and the $j$-th integer in the $(i+1)$-th line correspond to adjacent vertices in the graph.

It's up to Florida Man to stop it, but he first needs to find an important item.\n\nThere are $n$ haystacks labelled from $1$ to $n$, where haystack $i$ contains $a_i$ haybales. One of the haystacks has a needle hidden beneath it, but you do not know which one. Your task is to move the haybales so that each haystack is emptied at least once, allowing you to check if the needle is hidden under that particular haystack.\n\nHowever, the process is not that simple. Once a haystack $i$ is emptied for the first time, it will be assigned a height limit and can no longer contain more than $b_i$ haybales. More formally, a move is described as follows:\n\n- Choose two haystacks $i$ and $j$. If haystack $i$ has not been emptied before, or haystack $i$ contains strictly less than $b_i$ haybales, you may move exactly $1$ haybale from haystack $j$ to haystack $i$.\n\nNote: Before a haystack is emptied, it has no height limit, and you can move as many haybales as you want onto that haystack.\n\nCompute the minimum number of moves required to ensure that each haystack is emptied at least once, or report that it is impossible.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 5\\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of haystacks.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1\\le a_i, b_i\\le 10^9$) -- the initial number of haybales in the $i$-th haystack, and the height limit that it is assigned after it is emptied for the first time.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum number of moves required to ensure that each haystack is emptied at least once. If it is not possible to empty each haystack at least once, output -1.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n2\n\n3 5\n\n2 4\n\n2\n\n10 1\n\n1 10\n\n3\n\n1 3\n\n4 3\n\n1 1\n\n3\n\n5 4\n\n2 4\n\n1 10\n\n6\n\n2 1\n\n3 3\n\n5 4\n\n1 5\n\n1 6\n\n1 8\n\n5\n\n3 2\n\n1 2\n\n1 1\n\n1 3\n\n6 5\n\n2\n\n5 10\n\n7 12\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n8\n-1\n8\n9\n14\n15\n19\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, we can do the following sequence of moves:\n\n- Move $3$ haybales from haystack $1$ to haystack $2$. Haystack $1$ is now emptied, and is assigned a height limit of $5$.\n- Move $5$ haybales from haystack $2$ to haystack $1$. Haystack $2$ is now emptied, and is assigned a height limit of $4$.\n\nThe above sequence requires $3 + 5 = 8$ moves. It is not possible to use less than $8$ moves as the following sequence of moves is invalid:\n\n- Move $2$ haybales from haystack $2$ to haystack $1$. Haystack $2$ is now emptied, and is assigned a height limit of $4$.\n- Move $4$ haybales from haystack $1$ to haystack $2$. Haystack $1$ now has $1$ haybale, while haystack $2$ has $4$ haybales.\n- Haystack $1$ cannot be emptied as haystack $2$ is already at its height limit of $4$, so no more haybales can be moved from haystack $1$ to haystack $2$.\n\nIn the second test case, the task is impossible. This is because the height limits of both haystacks are too small that once one of the haystacks is emptied, the other haystack cannot be emptied due to the small height limits.\n\nIn the third test case, the following sequence of moves can be shown to be optimal:\n\n- Move $1$ haybale from haystack $1$ to haystack $3$. Haystack $1$ is now emptied, and is assigned a height limit of $3$.\n- Move $3$ haybales from haystack $2$ to haystack $1$.\n- Move $1$ haybale from haystack $2$ to haystack $3$. Haystack $2$ is now emptied and is assigned a height limit of $3$.\n- Move $3$ haybales from haystack $3$ to haystack $2$. Haystack $3$ is now emptied, and is assigned a height limit of $1$.\n\nThe above sequence requires $1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 8$ moves.",

Specifically, these times are represented by the array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the time (in minutes) at which a chip is installed in the $i$-th room.\n\nAs soon as a chip is installed, it changes the room's light status every $k$ minutes -- it turns on the light for $k$ minutes, then turns it off for the next $k$ minutes, then turns it back on for the next $k$ minutes, and so on. In other words, the light status is changed by the chip at minute $a_i$, $a_i + k$, $a_i + 2k$, $a_i + 3k$, $\\ldots$ for the $i$-th room.\n\nWhat is the earliest moment when all rooms in the apartment have their lights turned on?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of rooms in the apartment and the period of the chips.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the moments when the chips are installed.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the answer to the question (in minutes). If there is no such moment that the lights are turned on in all the rooms, print $-1$ instead.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n4 4\n\n2 3 4 5\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 4 5\n\n4 3\n\n3 4 8 9\n\n3 3\n\n6 2 1\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n7 5\n\n14 34 6 25 46 7 17\n\n6 5\n\n40 80 99 60 90 50\n\n6 5\n\n64 40 50 68 70 10\n\n2 1\n\n1 1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n-1\n10\n8\n1\n47\n100\n-1\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all lights will be on by the minute $5$ without any of them being turned off by the chips. The answer is $5$.\n\nIn the second test case, due to $k=3$, the $1$-st light will be on at minutes $2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, \\ldots$; meanwhile, the $4$-th light will be on at minutes $5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, \\ldots$. These two sequences don't have any number in common, so they will never be on at the same time.\n\nIn the third test case, it can be seen that the $1$-st and $2$-nd lights will be turned off at minutes $6$ and $7$, but the chips will turn them back on at minutes $9$ and $10$. The $3$-rd and $4$-th lights will also be on at minute $10$, so the answer is $10$.",

Find the maximum size of a complex subset of these segments.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) -- the number of segments.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le 2n$) -- the left endpoints of the segments.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$ ($l_i \\leq r_i \\le 2n$) -- the right endpoints of the segments.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum size of a complex subset of the given segments.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n5 4 6\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 6 8\n\n5 4 7 9 10\n\n5\n\n3 1 4 1 5\n\n7 2 6 5 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n4\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all pairs of segments intersect, therefore it is optimal to form a single group containing all of the three segments.\n\nIn the second test case, there is no valid partition for all of the five segments.

The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $m$ and $q$. In this version, $m=2$ and $q=1$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nNarek and Tsovak were busy preparing this round, so they have not managed to do their homework and decided to steal David's homework. Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teachers to help her catch David. And now $m$ teachers together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.\n\nThe classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from $1$ to $n$, inclusive.\n\nAt the start, all $m$ teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move\n\n- David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n- Then, each of the $m$ teachers simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n\nThis continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees others' moves, so they all act optimally.\n\nYour task is to find how many moves it will take for the teachers to catch David if they all act optimally.\n\nActing optimally means the student makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him; and the teachers coordinate with each other to make their moves in a way that minimizes the number of moves they need to catch the student.\n\nAlso, as Narek and Tsovak think this task is easy, they decided to give you $q$ queries on David's position. Note: this is the easy version, and you are given only one query.\n\n### Input\n\nIn the first line of the input, you are given a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, you are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $q$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $m=2$, $q=1$) -- the number of cells on the line, the number of teachers, and the number of queries.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, you are given $m$ distinct integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the cell numbers of the teachers.\n\nIn the third line of each test case, you are given $q$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_q$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- David's cell number for every query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that for any $i$, $j$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $1 \\le j \\le q$, $b_i \\neq a_j$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q$ lines, the $i$-th of them containing the answer of the $i$-th query.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n10 2 1\n\n1 4\n\n2\n\n8 2 1\n\n3 6\n\n1\n\n8 2 1\n\n3 6\n\n8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, the student can just stay at cell $2$.

There are $n$ different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type $1$ and needs a card of type $n$ to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the $n$ types of cards, which can be described by permutations$^{\\text{∗}}$ $q$, $k$, and $j$ for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\nA player values card $a$ more than card $b$ if for their permutation $p$, $p_a > p_b$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $b$ to Alice in exchange for card $a$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $a$ more than card $b$ if $a > b$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card $1$ to card $n$ subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of card types.\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$) -- a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card $n$.\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output $k$ -- the number of trades Alice will make. On the next $k$ lines output space separated a character $c\\in \\{\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{k}, \\texttt{j}\\}$ and integer $x$, denoting that Alice trades with player $c$ to get card $x$. It must be the case that on the $k$'th line, $x = n$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character $c$ denoting the player in the trade ($\\texttt{Q}, \\texttt{K}, \\texttt{J}$ will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n2 1 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 4 2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\n2\nk 2\nq 3\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first testcase, Alice can trade with the King to get card $2$. She can then trade with the Queen to get card $3$.\n\nIn the second testcase, even though Alice can trade with the Queen to get card $3$, with the King to get card $2$, and then with the Jack to get card $4$, this is not a valid solution since it doesn't respect Alice's preferences. We can show that there is no way for Alice to get to card $4$.",

The only difference is the maximum number of operations you can perform.

You need to walk from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, taking only steps to the right or down.\n- Formally, if you are in $(x,y)$ currently, you can step to either $(x+1,y)$ or $(x,y+1)$, but you can not step beyond the boundaries of the grid.\n- When you step in $(i,j)$, you must swap $a_i$ and $a_j$ when $i \\neq j$.\n\nYou can perform at most $n+4$ cool swap walks.

Then, $a=[1,2,3]$. Note that although the array $a$ is already non-decreasing, you can not stop until you reach $(n,n)$.\n\n- In the $2$-nd step, you step right to $(1,3)$.

The road is divided into $n$ sections, numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. The height of the surface in the $i$-th section is equal to $a_i$. If the height of the $i$-th section is greater than $0$, then the dump truck must take sand from the $i$-th section of the road, and if the height of the $i$-th section is less than $0$, the dump truck must fill the pit in the $i$-th section of the road with sand. It is guaranteed that the initial heights are not equal to $0$.\n\nWhen the dump truck is in the $i$-th section of the road, it can either take away $x$ units of sand, in which case the height of the surface in the $i$-th section will decrease by $x$, or it can fill in $x$ units of sand (provided that it currently has at least $x$ units of sand in its bed), in which case the height of the surface in the $i$-th section of the road will increase by $x$.\n\nThe dump truck can start its journey from any section of the road. Moving to an adjacent section on the left or right takes $1$ minute, and the time for loading and unloading sand can be neglected. The dump truck has an infinite capacity and is initially empty.\n\nYou need to find the minimum time required for the dump truck to level the sand so that the height in each section becomes equal to $0$. Note that after all movements, the dump truck may still have sand left in its bed. You need to solve this problem independently for the segments numbered from $l_i$ to $r_i$. Sand outside the segment cannot be used.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of sections and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$, $a_i \\neq 0$) -- the initial height in each section.\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $q$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$) -- the boundaries of the segment of sections for which the minimum time needs to be determined.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases and the sum of $q$ over all test cases do not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, output the minimum time required to level the sand in the segment $[l_i, r_i]$, or $-1$ if it is impossible.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 1\n\n-179\n\n1 1\n\n5 3\n\n-2 2 -1 3 -1\n\n2 4\n\n1 5\n\n1 3\n\n7 1\n\n1 1 1 -4 1 1 1\n\n1 7\n\n7 2\n\n2 -2 2 -2 1 2 -1\n\n1 7\n\n2 7\n\n4 4\n\n1000000000 1000000000 999999999 -1000000000\n\n2 4\n\n3 4\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1\n2\n5\n-1\n8\n6\n6\n2\n-1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $179$ units of sand need to be added to the only section. However, there is nowhere to take it from, so this is impossible.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n- In the first query, the dump truck can start its journey at the second section. It can take $2$ units of sand, after which the height in the second section will become $0$. Then the dump truck can move to the third section. It can pour $1$ unit of sand there, after which the height in the third section will become $0$. Then the dump truck can move to the fourth section. There it can take $3$ units of sand, after which the height in the fourth section will become $0$. In total, the dump truck will spend $2$ minutes on movements.\n- In the second query, the dump truck can start its journey at the fourth section. It can take $3$ units of sand, after which the height in the fourth section will become $0$. Then the dump truck can move to the fifth section. It can pour $1$ unit of sand there, after which the height in the fifth section will become $0$. Then the dump truck can move back to the fourth section and then to the third. It can pour $1$ unit of sand there, after which the height in the third section will become $0$. Then the dump truck can move to the second section. It can take $2$ units of sand. Then it can move to the first section. It can pour $2$ units of sand there, after which the height in the first section will become $0$. In total, the dump truck will spend $5$ minutes on movements.\n- In the third query, the dump truck will not be able to make the height in each section equal to $0$.",

But today he came up with a way to do it for fun! Let's take, for example, a table of size $2 \\times 2$, with rows numbered from top to bottom and columns numbered from left to right. We place $1$ in the top left cell, $2$ in the bottom right, $3$ in the bottom left, and $4$ in the top right. That's all he needs for fun!\n\nFortunately for Vadim, he has a table of size $2^n \\times 2^n$. He plans to fill it with integers from $1$ to $2^{2n}$ in ascending order. To fill such a large table, Vadim will divide it into $4$ equal square tables, filling the top left one first, then the bottom right one, followed by the bottom left one, and finally the top right one. Each smaller table will be divided into even smaller ones as he fills them until he reaches tables of size $2 \\times 2$, which he will fill in the order described above.\n\nNow Vadim is eager to start filling the table, but he has $q$ questions of two types:\n\n- what number will be in the cell at the $x$-th row and $y$-th column;\n- in which cell coordinates will the number $d$ be located.\n\nHelp answer Vadim's questions.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 10)$  -- the number of sets of input data. The following lines describe the input data sets.\n\nIn the first line of each data set, there is an integer $n$, describing the size of the table $(1 \\le n \\le 30)$.\n\nIn the second line of each data set, there is an integer $q$  -- the number of questions $(1 \\le q \\le 20\\,000)$.\n\nIn the following $q$ lines of each data set, the questions are described in the following formats:\n\n- -\\> x y  -- What number will be in the cell $(1 \\le x, y \\le 2^n)$;\n- <\\- d  -- In which cell coordinates will the number $(1 \\le d \\le 2^{2n})$ be located.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $20\\,000$.\n\n### Output\n\nOutput the answers to each question on a separate line.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n-\\> 4 3\n\n<\\- 15\n\n<\\- 4\n\n-\\> 3 1\n\n-\\> 1 3\n\n1\n\n8\n\n-\\> 1 1\n\n-\\> 1 2\n\n-\\> 2 1\n\n-\\> 2 2\n\n<\\- 1\n\n<\\- 2\n\n<\\- 3\n\n<\\- 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n7\n2 3\n1 2\n9\n13\n1\n4\n3\n2\n1 1\n2 2\n2 1\n1 2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThis is how the filled table from the first example looks:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/da748157aec3b2f6a243518e84d255f6a0b8b6c6.png)",

Before you calculate the score, you can shuffle the elements of $a$ however you want.\n\nFind the maximum score that you can get if you shuffle the elements of $a$ optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$) -- the number of elements in $a$.\n\nThe following line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 1000$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum score that you can get.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n1\n\n69\n\n3\n\n7 6 5\n\n5\n\n1 1 1 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n4\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is no other way to rearrange $a$.

They decided to construct a permutation$^{\\dagger}$ of length $n$.\n\nFor the permutation, Noobish\\_Monk came up with the following function: $g(i)$ is the sum of all the numbers in the permutation on a prefix of length $i$ that are not greater than $m$. Similarly, Gorilla came up with the function $f$, where $f(i)$ is the sum of all the numbers in the permutation on a prefix of length $i$ that are not less than $k$. A prefix of length $i$ is a subarray consisting of the first $i$ elements of the original array.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$, $m = 2$, $k = 5$, and the permutation is $[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]$, then:\n\n- $f(1) = 5$, because $5 \\ge 5$; $g(1) = 0$, because $5 > 2$;\n- $f(2) = 5$, because $3 < 5$; $g(2) = 0$, because $3 > 2$;\n- $f(3) = 5$, because $4 < 5$; $g(3) = 0$, because $4 > 2$;\n- $f(4) = 5$, because $1 < 5$; $g(4) = 1$, because $1 \\le 2$;\n- $f(5) = 5$, because $2 < 5$; $g(5) = 1 + 2 = 3$, because $2 \\le 2$.\n\nHelp them find a permutation for which the value of $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i) - \\sum_{i=1}^n g(i)\\right)$ is maximized.\n\n$^{\\dagger}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in any order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (as $2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation (as $n=3$, but $4$ appears in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)  -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each case contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($2\\le n \\le 10^5$; $1 \\le m < k \\le n$) -- the size of the permutation to be constructed and two integers.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the permutation  -- a set of numbers that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

In this case, the trip does not exempt them from completing their homework, so they do their homework right on the plane. Artem is one of those teachers, and he was assigned the following homework at the university.\n\nWith an arbitrary string $a$ of even length $m$, he can perform the following operation. Artem splits the string $a$ into two halves $x$ and $y$ of equal length, after which he performs exactly one of three actions:\n\n- For each $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, \\frac{m}{2}\\right\\}$ assign $x_i = (x_i + y_i) \\bmod 2$;\n- For each $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, \\frac{m}{2}\\right\\}$ assign $y_i = (x_i + y_i) \\bmod 2$;\n- Perform an arbitrary number of operations (the same operations defined above, applied recursively) on the strings $x$ and $y$, independently of each other. Note that in this case, the strings $x$ and $y$ must be of even length.\n\nAfter that, the string $a$ is replaced by the strings $x$ and $y$, concatenated in the same order.\n\nUnfortunately, Artem fell asleep on the plane, so you will have to complete his homework. Artem has two binary strings $s$ and $t$ of length $n$, each consisting of $n$ characters 0 or 1. Determine whether it is possible to make string $s$ equal to string $t$ with an arbitrary number of operations.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$) -- the length of the strings $s$ and $t$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains the string $t$ of length $n$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"Yes\" (without quotes) if it is possible to make string $s$ equal to string $t$, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n8\n\n00001001\n\n10101001\n\n8\n\n00000000\n\n00001001\n\n6\n\n010110\n\n100010\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYes\nNo\nYes\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the string 00001001 can be transformed into the string 10101001 in two operations.

Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teachers to help her catch David. And now $m$ teachers together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.\n\nThe classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from $1$ to $n$, inclusive.\n\nAt the start, all $m$ teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move\n\n- David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n- Then, each of the $m$ teachers simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.\n\nThis continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees others' moves, so they all act optimally.\n\nYour task is to find how many moves it will take for the teachers to catch David if they all act optimally.\n\nActing optimally means the student makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him; and the teachers coordinate with each other to make their moves in a way that minimizes the number of moves they need to catch the student.\n\nAlso, as Narek and Tsovak think this task is easy, they decided to give you $q$ queries on David's position.\n\n### Input\n\nIn the first line of the input, you are given a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, you are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $q$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le m, q \\le 10^5$) -- the number of cells on the line, the number of teachers, and the number of queries.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, you are given $m$ distinct integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the cell numbers of the teachers.\n\nIn the third line of each test case, you are given $q$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_q$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- David's cell number for every query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that for any $i$, $j$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $1 \\le j \\le q$, $b_i \\neq a_j$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q$ lines, the $i$-th of them containing the answer of the $i$-th query.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n8 1 1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n10 3 3\n\n1 4 8\n\n2 3 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the only query of the first example, the student can run to cell $1$. It will take the teacher five moves to reach from cell $6$ to cell $1$, so the answer is $5$.\n\nIn the second query of the second example, the student can just stay at cell $3$. The teacher, initially located in cell $4$, can reach cell $3$ in one move. Therefore, the answer is $1$.",

The $i$-th barrel initially contains $a_i$ kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all barrels weigh the same.\n\nYou know that exactly one of the barrels has a small amount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total weight of $0.179$ kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.\n\nAll the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.\n\nThe scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.\n\nYou also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.\n\nHowever, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be avoided.\n\nHowever, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without touching it.\n\nIn other words, you can choose the numbers $i, j, x$ ($i \\neq j, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, 0 < x \\leq a_i$, the barrel numbered $i$ is not poisonous) and execute $a_i := a_i - x$, $a_j := a_j + x$. Where $x$ is not necessarily an integer.\n\nIs it possible to guarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and remain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know that the poison is located on exactly one of the barrels.\n\nAdditionally, we ask you to process $q$ queries. In each query, either one of the existing barrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of water is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is possible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given that there is exactly one.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) -- the volumes of water in the existing barrels.\n\nThe next $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is either of the form \\+ x or \\- x, which means, respectively, adding and removing a barrel with $x$ kilograms of water. It is guaranteed that when the query \\- x is made, one of the existing barrels has a volume of $x$, and that there is always at least one barrel remaining throughout the queries. In all queries, $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nOutput $q+1$ lines, the answer to the problem before all queries, and after each query. If it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4 7\n\n2 2 4 11\n\n\\- 2\n\n\\+ 4\n\n\\+ 30\n\n\\+ 40\n\n\\- 4\n\n\\+ 2\n\n\\+ 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n6 7\n\n5000 1000 400 400 100 99\n\n\\+ 1\n\n\\- 5000\n\n\\- 1\n\n\\- 400\n\n\\- 400\n\n\\- 100\n\n\\- 99\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test, before any queries, the weights of the barrels are $[2, 2, 4, 11]$. You can compare the values of the first and second barrels. If the result is not equal, you can definitively conclude that the barrel with the greater weight is poisonous. If the result is equal, both barrels are non-poisonous. Then you can pour all the contents of the first barrel into the second. After that, both the second and third barrels will contain $4$ kilograms of water. Now let's compare the values of the second and third barrels. If the result is not equal, the barrel with the greater weight is poisonous. Otherwise, both barrels are non-poisonous. The only barrel that could be poisonous is barrel 4. Thus, with this strategy, we can safely determine the poisonous barrel.",

All items have a cost, and the $i$-th item costs $a_i$. Players move in turns starting from Alice.\n\nIn each turn, the player chooses one of the remaining items and takes it. The game goes on until no items are left.\n\nLet's say that $A$ is the total cost of items taken by Alice and $B$ is the total cost of Bob's items. The resulting score of the game then will be equal to $A - B$.\n\nAlice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both Alice and Bob will play optimally.\n\nBut the game will take place tomorrow, so today Bob can modify the costs a little. He can increase the costs $a_i$ of several (possibly none or all) items by an integer value (possibly, by the same value or by different values for each item). However, the total increase must be less than or equal to $k$. Otherwise, Alice may suspect something. Note that Bob can't decrease costs, only increase.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible score Bob can achieve?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) -- the number of test cases. Then $t$ cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $0 \\le k \\le 10^9$) -- the number of items and the maximum total increase Bob can make.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the initial costs of the items.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum possible score $A - B$ after Bob increases the costs of several (possibly none or all) items.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 5\n\n1 10\n\n3 0\n\n10 15 12\n\n4 6\n\n3 1 2 4\n\n2 4\n\n6 9\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n13\n0\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Bob can increase $a_1$ by $5$, making costs equal to $[6, 10]$. Tomorrow, Alice will take $10$ and Bob will take $6$. The total score will be equal to $10 - 6 = 4$, and it's the minimum possible.\n\nIn the second test case, Bob can't change costs. So the score will be equal to $(15 + 10) - 12 = 13$, since Alice will take $15$, Bob will take $12$, and Alice -- $10$.\n\nIn the third test case, Bob, for example, can increase $a_1$ by $1$, $a_2$ by $3$, and $a_3$ by $2$. The total change is equal to $1 + 3 + 2 \\le 6$ and costs will be equal to $[4, 4, 4, 4]$. Obviously, the score will be equal to $(4 + 4) - (4 + 4) = 0$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, Bob can increase $a_1$ by $3$, making costs equal to $[9, 9]$. The score will be equal to $9 - 9 = 0$.",

We build the the divisor tree $T_{n,d}$ as follows:\n\n- The root of the tree is a node marked with number $n$.

These children will be in the $(i+1)$-st layer.\n- The vertices on the $d$-th layer are the leaves of the tree.\n\nFor example, $T_{6,2}$ (the divisor tree for $n = 6$ and $d = 2$) looks like this:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/78c70e79ff2523fff4760665c9512ce7f9360607.png)\n\nDefine $f(n,d)$ as the number of leaves in $T_{n,d}$.\n\nGiven integers $n$, $k$, and $d$, please compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$, modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n$^\\dagger$ In this problem, we say that an integer $y$ is a divisor of $x$ if $y \\ge 1$ and there exists an integer $z$ such that $x = y \\cdot z$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).

Thus, we need to find the total number of leaves in the divisor trees $T_{1,1}$, $T_{2,1}$, $T_{3,1}$, $T_{4,1}$, $T_{5,1}$, $T_{6,1}$.\n\n- $T_{1,1}$ has only one leaf, which is marked with $1$.\n- $T_{2,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $2$.\n- $T_{3,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $3$.\n- $T_{4,1}$ has three leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, and $4$.\n- $T_{5,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $5$.\n- $T_{6,1}$ has four leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$.\n\nThe total number of leaves is $1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 14$.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 1$, $k = 3$, $d = 3$.

She starts at position $1$, and the path ends at position $L$. When she is at position $x$ with a jump power of $k$, she can jump to any integer position in the interval $[x, x+k]$. Initially, her jump power is $1$.\n\nHowever, her surf path isn't completely smooth. There are $n$ hurdles on her path. Each hurdle is represented by an interval $[l, r]$, meaning she cannot jump to any position in the interval $[l, r]$.\n\nThere are also $m$ power-ups at certain positions on the path. Power-up $i$ is located at position $x_i$ and has a value of $v_i$. When Mualani is at position $x_i$, she has the option to collect the power-up to increase her jump power by $v_i$. There may be multiple power-ups at the same position. When she is at a position with some power-ups, she may choose to take or ignore each individual power-up. No power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $L$ to finish the path? If it is not possible to finish the surf path, output $-1$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $L$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 3 \\leq L \\leq 10^9$) -- the number of hurdles, the number of power-ups, and the position of the end.\n\nThe following $n$ lines contain two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($2 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq L-1$) -- the bounds of the interval for the $i$'th hurdle. It is guaranteed that $r_i + 1 < l_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\leq i < n$ (i.e. all hurdles are non-overlapping, sorted by increasing positions, and the end point of a previous hurdle is not consecutive with the start point of the next hurdle).\n\nThe following $m$ lines contain two integers $x_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \\leq x_i, v_i \\leq L$) -- the position and the value for the $i$'th power-up. There may be multiple power-ups with the same $x$. It is guaranteed that $x_i \\leq x_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\leq i < m$ (i.e. the power-ups are sorted by non-decreasing position) and no power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $L$. If it is not possible, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 5 50\n\n7 14\n\n30 40\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\n3 5\n\n18 2\n\n22 32\n\n4 3 50\n\n4 6\n\n15 18\n\n20 26\n\n34 38\n\n1 2\n\n8 2\n\n10 2\n\n1 4 17\n\n10 14\n\n1 6\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n16 9\n\n1 2 10\n\n5 9\n\n2 3\n\n2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n-1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, she can collect power-ups $1$, $2$, $3$, and $5$ to clear all hurdles.\n\nIn the second test case, she cannot jump over the first hurdle.\n\nIn the fourth test case, by collecting both power-ups, she can jump over the hurdle.",

If Bessie calls the binary search as shown in the above code for $k_i$, it will return $x_i$.\n\nIt might not be possible for all $m$ tests to be correct on the same array, so Farmer John will remove some of them so Bessie can AC. Let $r$ be the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array $[a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$ with $1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$ so that all remaining tests are correct.\n\nIn addition to finding $r$, Farmer John wants you to count the number of arrays $[a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$ with $1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$ such that there exists a way to remove exactly $r$ tests so that all the remaining tests are correct.

Each person considers every piece to be worth a different value.

The division needs to satisfy the following constraints:\n\n- No piece is assigned to more than one person, i.e., no two subarrays among $[l_a,\\ldots,r_a]$, $[l_b, \\ldots, r_b]$ and $[l_c, \\ldots, r_c]$ intersect.\n- $ \\sum_{i = l_a}^{r_a} a_i, \\sum_{i = l_b}^{r_b} b_i, \\sum_{i = l_c}^{r_c} c_i \\geq \\lceil \\frac{tot}{3} \\rceil$.\n\nHere, the notation $\\lceil \\frac{a}{b} \\rceil$ represents ceiling division.

Then, the resulting interval of vulnerability may be either $[l_p - 1, r_p]$ or $[l_p, r_p + 1]$.\n\nGiven a set of planets, orangutans can destroy all planets if the intervals of vulnerability of all planets in the set intersect at least one common point.

They faced the following problem: they traded the same type of goods, and if they traded in the same city, they would inevitably incur losses. They decided to divide up the cities between them where they would trade.\n\nThe map of Rome can be represented in this problem as a plane with certain points marked -- the cities of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe merchants decided to choose a certain dividing point $(x_0, y_0)$. Then, in a city with coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$,\n\n- the first merchant sells goods if $x_0 \\le x_i$ and $y_0 \\le y_i$;\n- the second merchant sells goods if $x_0 > x_i$ and $y_0 \\le y_i$;\n- the third merchant sells goods if $x_0 \\le x_i$ and $y_0 > y_i$;\n- the fourth merchant sells goods if $x_0 > x_i$ and $y_0 > y_i$.\n\nThe merchants want to choose $(x_0, y_0)$ in such a way as to maximize the smallest number of cities that any of them gets (i. e., as fair as possible). Please find such a point for them.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).

This is because some cities may be so close that they cannot be distinguished on the map at the given scale.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, in the first line, print a single integer $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n}{4}$) -- the maximum possible number of cities that each merchant can get at a minimum.\n\nIn the second line, print two integers $x_0$ and $y_0$ ($|x_0|, |y_0| \\le 10^9$) -- the coordinates of the dividing point.

The only difference is that you only need to output the minimum total cost of operations in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.\n\nYou're given an array $a$ of length $n$, and an array $b$ of length $m$ ($b_i > b_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\le i < m$). Initially, the value of $k$ is $1$. Your aim is to make the array $a$ empty by performing one of these two operations repeatedly:\n\n- Type $1$ -- If the value of $k$ is less than $m$ and the array $a$ is not empty, you can increase the value of $k$ by $1$. This does not incur any cost.\n- Type $2$ -- You remove a non-empty prefix of array $a$, such that its sum does not exceed $b_k$. This incurs a cost of $m - k$.\n\nYou need to minimize the total cost of the operations to make array $a$ empty. If it's impossible to do this through any sequence of operations, output $-1$. Otherwise, output the minimum total cost of the operations.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$).

Choose the prefix to be $[9]$. This incurs a cost of $1$.\n- Perform an operation of type $1$. The value of $k$ is now $2$. This incurs no cost.\n- Perform an operation of type $2$. Choose the prefix to be $[3, 4]$. This incurs a cost of $0$.\n- Perform an operation of type $2$. Choose the prefix to be $[3]$. This incurs a cost of $0$.\n- The array $a$ is now empty, and the total cost of all operations is $1$.\n\nIn the second test case, it's impossible to remove any prefix of the array since $a_1 > b_1$, so array $a$ cannot be made empty by any sequence of operations.",

As such, he really needs your help with this one.\n\nIn the wilderness lies a region of mountainous terrain represented as a rectangular grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each cell in the grid is identified by its position $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index. The altitude of cell $(i, j)$ is denoted by $a_{i,j}$.\n\nHowever, this region has been tampered with.

For every cell $(i, j)$ along this path, the altitude $a_{i,j}$ has been set to $0$. The path moves strictly via downward ($\\mathtt{D}$) or rightward ($\\mathtt{R}$) steps.\n\nTo restore the terrain to its original state, it is known that the region possessed a magical property before it was tampered with: all rows and all columns shared the same sum of altitudes. More formally, there exists an integer $x$ such that $\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{i, j} = x$ for all $1\\le i\\le n$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i, j} = x$ for all $1\\le j\\le m$.\n\nYour task is to assign new altitudes to the cells on the path such that the above magical property is restored.

The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$) -- the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n+m-2$ ($s_i = \\mathtt{D}$ or $s_i = \\mathtt{R}$) -- the steps the path makes from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$. The character $\\mathtt{D}$ represents a downward step, and $\\mathtt{R}$ represents a rightward step.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines each contain $m$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$ ($-10^6 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^6$) -- the altitude of each cell in the grid. It is guaranteed that if a cell $(i, j)$ lies on the path, then $a_{i,j} = 0$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ lines of $m$ integers representing the restored grid of altitudes $b_{i, j}$. The altitudes must satisfy $-10^{15} \\leq b_{i,j} \\leq 10^{15}$, and additionally $a_{i,j} = b_{i,j}$ if $(i, j)$ is not on the path. If multiple solutions exist, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 3\n\nDRRD\n\n0 2 3\n\n0 0 0\n\n3 1 0\n\n4 5\n\nDRRRRDD\n\n0 1 0 2 3\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n-1 0 -3 -3 0\n\n0 0 0 -1 0\n\n2 3\n\nRRD\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n5 5\n\nDDDDRRRR\n\n0 25 2 9 11\n\n0 6 13 20 22\n\n0 17 24 1 8\n\n0 3 10 12 19\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\n-6 1 0 2 3\n7 -1 3 2 -11\n-1 0 -3 -3 7\n0 0 0 -1 1\n0 -1 1\n0 1 -1\n18 25 2 9 11\n4 6 13 20 22\n15 17 24 1 8\n21 3 10 12 19\n7 14 16 23 5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the grid has been filled such that every row and column contains the numbers $1, 2, 3$ in some order, resulting in a common sum of $6$.\n\nIn the second test case, the grid has been filled such that all rows and columns sum to $0$.",

In this version, it is guaranteed that $q \\leq 10^5$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nAn integer grid $A$ with $p$ rows and $q$ columns is called beautiful if:\n\n- All elements of the grid are integers between $0$ and $2^{30}-1$, and\n- For any subgrid, the XOR of the values at the corners is equal to $0$.

Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.\n\nHowever, Monocarp thinks that this problem is too easy. Therefore, he will perform $q$ updates on the grid. In each update, he will choose an unfilled cell and assign an integer to it. Note that these updates are persistent. That is, changes made to the grid will apply when processing future updates.\n\nFor each of the $q + 1$ states of the grid, the initial state and after each of the $q$ queries, determine the number of ways Polycarp can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.

In this case, $f(a) = 3$ as the longest palindromic subsequence has length $3$. There are $7$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $3$ that is a palindrome, as shown below:\n\n1. $[a_1, a_2, a_5] = [1, 1, 1]$\n2. $[a_1, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$\n3. $[a_1, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$\n4. $[a_2, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$\n5. $[a_2, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$\n6. $[a_3, a_4, a_6] = [2, 3, 2]$\n7. $[a_3, a_5, a_6] = [2, 1, 2]$\n\nTherefore, $g(a) = 7$, which is greater than $n = 6$. Hence, $a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$ is a valid solution.\n\nIn the second example, one possible solution is $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$. In this case, $f(a) = 5$. There are $24$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $5$ that is a palindrome. Some examples are $[a_2, a_4, a_5, a_8, a_9] = [3, 7, 5, 7, 3]$ and $[a_1, a_4, a_6, a_7, a_8] = [7, 7, 3, 7, 7]$. Therefore, $g(a) = 24$, which is greater than $n = 9$. Hence, $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$ is a valid solution.\n\nIn the third example, $f(a) = 7$ and $g(a) = 190$, which is greater than $n = 15$.",

He wants to partition the array into one or more contiguous segments such that each element $a_i$ belongs to exactly one segment.\n\nA partition is called cool if, for every segment $b_j$, all elements in $b_j$ also appear in $b_{j + 1}$ (if it exists). That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.\n\nFor example, if $a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5]$, a cool partition Yousef can make is $b_1 = [1, 2]$, $b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]$. This is a cool partition because every element in $b_1$ (which are $1$ and $2$) also appears in $b_2$. In contrast, $b_1 = [1, 2, 2]$, $b_2 = [3, 1, 5]$ is not a cool partition, since $2$ appears in $b_1$ but not in $b_2$.\n\nNote that after partitioning the array, you do not change the order of the segments. Also, note that if an element appears several times in some segment $b_j$, it only needs to appear at least once in $b_{j + 1}$.\n\nYour task is to help Yousef by finding the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n6\n\n1 2 2 3 1 5\n\n8\n\n1 2 1 3 2 1 3 2\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n10\n\n5 8 7 5 8 5 7 8 10 9\n\n3\n\n1 2 2\n\n9\n\n3 3 1 4 3 2 4 1 2\n\n6\n\n4 5 4 5 6 4\n\n8\n\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n3\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first test case is explained in the statement. We can partition it into $b_1 = [1, 2]$, $b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]$. It can be shown there is no other partition with more segments.\n\nIn the second test case, we can partition the array into $b_1 = [1, 2]$, $b_2 = [1, 3, 2]$, $b_3 = [1, 3, 2]$. The maximum number of segments is $3$.\n\nIn the third test case, the only partition we can make is $b_1 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$. Any other partition will not satisfy the condition.

In one operation, you can do the following:\n\n- Choose some integer $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and an integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot n \\cdot m$).\n- For all integers $k$ from $i$ to $n$ in increasing order, do the following:\n1. Add the element $x$ to the beginning of the $k$-th array.\n\n2. Assign $x$ the value of the last element in the $k$-th array.\n\n3. Remove the last element from the $k$-th array.\n\nIn other words, you can insert an element at the beginning of any array, after which all elements in this and all following arrays are shifted by one to the right. The last element of the last array is removed.\n\nYou are also given a description of the arrays that need to be obtained after all operations. That is, after performing the operations, the $j$-th element of the $i$-th array should be equal to $b_{i, j}$. It is guaranteed that all $b_{i, j}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of operations that need to be performed to obtain the desired arrays, and also output the sequence of all operations itself.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of arrays and the number of elements in each array.\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, m}$ ($1 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 2 \\cdot n \\cdot m$) -- the elements of the $i$-th original array. It is guaranteed that all $a_{i, j}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $b_{i, 1}, b_{i, 2}, \\ldots, b_{i, m}$ ($1 \\le b_{i, j} \\le 2 \\cdot n \\cdot m$) -- the elements of the $i$-th final array. It is guaranteed that all $b_{i, j}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of operations that need to be performed.\n\nNext, for each operation output two integers $i$ and $x$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$, $1 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot n \\cdot m$) -- the index of the array where the element is inserted and the value of the element, respectively.\n\nIf there are multiple possible sequences with the minimum number of operations, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 2\n\n2 6\n\n3 4\n\n1 2\n\n7 8\n\n1 5\n\n5 4 1 2 3\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\n11 1 2\n\n12 3 4\n\n13 5 6\n\n4 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n5 6 7 8\n\n9 10 11 12\n\n13 14 15 16\n\n17 1 2 3\n\n4 18 5 6\n\n7 19 8 20\n\n9 21 22 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n1 1\n2 8\n2 7\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n3\n1 11\n2 12\n3 13\n6\n3 20\n2 18\n3 19\n4 22\n4 21\n1 17\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the following sequence of $3$ operations is suitable:\n\n- Apply the operation to the first array with $x = 1$. Then the element $1$ will be added to the beginning of the first array, and the value of $x$ will become $6$. The last element will be removed, and the first array will look like $[1, 2]$. Next, the element $x$ is added to the beginning of the second array, and the value of $x$ becomes $4$. The last element of the second array is removed, and both arrays look like $[1, 2]$ and $[6, 3]$ respectively after the first operation.\n- Apply the operation to the second array with $x = 8$. Then the first array remains unchanged, and both arrays will look like $[1, 2]$ and $[8, 6]$ respectively.\n- Apply the operation to the second array with $x = 7$, then both arrays will have the required appearance $[1, 2]$ and $[7, 8]$ respectively.\n\nIn the second test case, the desired array can only be achieved in $5$ operations.\n\nIn the third test case, the following sequence of $3$ operations is suitable:\n\n- Apply the operation with $x = 11$ to the first array.\n- Apply the operation with $x = 12$ to the second array.\n- Apply the operation with $x = 13$ to the third array.",

It's the final round and Robin Hood is playing against Sheriff!\n\nThere are $n$ targets in a row numbered from $1$ to $n$. When a player shoots target $i$, their score increases by $a_i$ and the target $i$ is destroyed. The game consists of turns and players alternate between whose turn it is. Robin Hood always starts the game, then Sheriff and so on. The game continues until all targets are destroyed. Both players start with score $0$.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with most score wins and the other player loses. If both players have the same score, it's a tie and no one wins or loses. In each turn, the player can shoot any target that wasn't shot before. Both play optimally to get the most score possible.\n\nSheriff of Nottingham has a suspicion that he might lose the game! This cannot happen, you must help Sheriff. Sheriff will pose $q$ queries, each specifying $l$ and $r$. This means that the game would be played only with targets $l, l+1, \\dots, r$, as others would be removed by Sheriff before the game starts.\n\nFor each query $l$, $r$, determine whether the Sheriff can not lose the game when only considering the targets $l, l+1, \\dots, r$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($1 \\le n,q \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) -- the number of targets and the queries Sheriff will pose.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) -- the points for hitting each target.\n\nThen follow $q$ lines, each with two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$) -- the range of the targets that is considered for each query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of both $n$ and $q$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, output \"YES\", if the Sheriff does not lose the game when only considering the targets $l, l+1, \\dots, r$, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower).

The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array $a$ and a matrix $b$ of integers with $n$ rows and $m$ columns, numbered from $1$. The cell in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is $(i, j)$.\n\nThey are looking for the elements of $a$ in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of $a$ (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell $(r, c)$. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at $(r + 1, c + 1)$ and ending in $(n, m)$ (the submatrix can be empty if $r=n$ or $c=m$). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\nNote: since the input is large, you may need to optimize input/output for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\n```\n`int main() {<br/>    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);<br/>    cin.tie(NULL); cout.tie(NULL);<br/>}<br/>````\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1500$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $l$, $n$, and $m$ ($1 \\le l, n, m \\le 1500$) -- the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $l$ integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots a_l$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n \\cdot m$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nThe $i$-th of the last $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, b_{i,3}, \\ldots b_{i,m}$ ($1 \\le b_{i,j} \\le n \\cdot m$) -- representing the $i$-th row of the matrix.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $l$ over all test cases does not exceed $1500$.\n\n### Output\n\nYou should output $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the $i$-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3 6\n\n4 6 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 3 2\n\n4 2 5 1\n\n2 4 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n5 6\n\n7 8\n\n8 8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nN\nT\nN\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, Tsovak starts by looking for $1$. There is only one occurrence of $1$ at $(1,1)$, so he chooses it. Then Narek needs to look for $2$ in the submatrix of $(2, 2)$, which consists of just the last two elements: $6$ and $2$. He chooses $2$, and then Tsovak loses since the array has ended.\n\nIn the second example, Tsovak needs to choose $1$. There is a $1$ at the cell $(n,m)$, so he chooses that cell. Then, since the submatrix of $(n + 1, m + 1)$ is empty, Narek cannot find $2$, so he loses.",

He even came up with his own way to calculate its cost.\n\nHe knows that in a regular bracket sequence (RBS), each opening bracket is paired up with the corresponding closing bracket. So he decided to calculate the cost of RBS as the sum of distances between pairs of corresponding bracket pairs.\n\nFor example, let's look at RBS (())(). It has three pairs of brackets:\n\n- (\\_\\_)\\_\\_: the distance between brackets at position $1$ and at $4$ is $4 - 1 = 3$;\n- \\_()\\_\\_\\_: the distance is $3 - 2 = 1$;\n- \\_\\_\\_\\_(): the distance is $6 - 5 = 1$.\n\nSo the cost of (())() is $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nUnfortunately, due to data corruption, Monocarp lost all characters on odd positions $s_1, s_3, \\dots, s_{n-1}$. Only characters on even positions ($s_2, s_4, \\dots, s_{n}$) remain. For example, (())() turned to \\_(\\_)\\_).\n\nMonocarp wants to restore his RBS by placing brackets on the odd positions. But since the restored RBS may not be unique, he wants to choose one with minimum cost. It's too hard to do for Monocarp alone, so can you help him?\n\nReminder: A regular bracket sequence is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted 1-s and +-s, gives a valid mathematical expression. For example, (), (()) or (()())() are RBS, while ), ()( or ())(() are not.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) -- the number of test cases. Next $t$ cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $n$ is even) -- the length of string $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, where all characters on the odd positions are '\\_' and all characters on the even positions are either '(' or ')'.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n\n- $s$ can be restored to at least one regular bracket sequence;\n- the total sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the minimum cost of the regular bracket sequence that can be obtained from $s$ by replacing '\\_'-s with brackets.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\\_(\\_)\\_)\n\n2\n\n\\_)\n\n8\n\n\\_)\\_)\\_)\\_)\n\n8\n\n\\_(\\_)\\_(\\_)\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n4\n8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it's optimal to make $s$ equal to (())(). The cost of $s$ will be equal to $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nIn the second test case, the only option is to make $s$ equal to () with cost $1$.\n\nIn the third test case, the only possible RBS is ()()()() with cost $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it's optimal to make $s$ equal to (())(()) with cost $3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8$.",

Let a caterpillar be denoted by an integer pair $(p, q)$ ($1 \\leq p, q \\leq n$, $p \\neq q$): its head is at vertex $p$, its tail is at vertex $q$, and it dominates all the vertices on the simple path from $p$ to $q$ (including $p$ and $q$). The caterpillar sequence of $(p, q)$ is defined as the sequence consisting only of the vertices on the simple path, sorted in the ascending order of the distance to $p$.\n\nNora and Aron are taking turns moving the caterpillar, with Nora going first. Both players will be using his or her own optimal strategy:\n\n- They will play to make himself or herself win;\n- However, if it is impossible, they will play to prevent the other person from winning (thus, the game will end in a tie).\n\nIn Nora's turn, she must choose a vertex $u$ adjacent to vertex $p$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $u$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$. In Aron's turn, he must choose a vertex $v$ adjacent to vertex $q$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $v$. Note that the moves allowed to the two players are different.\n\nWhenever $p$ is a leaf$^{\\text{†}}$, Nora wins$^{\\text{‡}}$. Whenever $q$ is a leaf, Aron wins. If either initially both $p$ and $q$ are leaves, or after $10^{100}$ turns the game has not ended, the result is a tie.\n\nPlease count the number of integer pairs $(p, q)$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq n$ and $p \\neq q$ such that, if the caterpillar is initially $(p, q)$, Aron wins the game.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$In other words: Let the current caterpillar sequence be $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$, then after the move, the new caterpillar sequence becomes $d(u, c_1), d(u, c_2), \\ldots, d(u, c_k)$. Here, $d(x, y)$ is the next vertex on the simple path from $y$ to $x$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$In a tree, a vertex is called a leaf if and only if its degree is $1$.\n\n$^{\\text{‡}}$Therefore, Nora never fails to choose a vertex $u$ when the game has not ended. The same goes for Aron.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 2\\cdot 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $n - 1$ lines each contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$), denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $4\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of integer pairs $(p, q)$ which make Aron win.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n12\n\n1 6\n\n11 2\n\n4 8\n\n12 3\n\n2 7\n\n6 12\n\n8 1\n\n2 3\n\n5 12\n\n9 2\n\n10 3\n\n10\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 6\n\n4 7\n\n6 8\n\n4 9\n\n4 10\n\n25\n\n1 16\n\n11 22\n\n6 14\n\n3 1\n\n20 14\n\n23 17\n\n25 19\n\n10 11\n\n3 18\n\n10 6\n\n2 21\n\n4 5\n\n11 12\n\n4 9\n\n9 13\n\n8 6\n\n6 1\n\n3 7\n\n8 19\n\n10 24\n\n15 13\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n17 8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n6\n40\n27\n171\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all possible caterpillars are $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$, resulting in a tie at the beginning, since both $p$ and $q$ are leaves.\n\nIn the second test case, the caterpillars that allow Aron to win are the following: $(1, 3)$, $(1, 4)$, $(1, 5)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$, $(2, 5)$. Let's look at some specific caterpillars.\n\n- For the caterpillar $(1, 5)$: vertex $p = 1$ is not a leaf, but vertex $q = 5$ is, so Aron wins at the beginning.\n- For the caterpillar $(2, 1)$: vertex $p = 2$ is not a leaf, neither is vertex $q = 1$. In Nora's first move, she can choose to move the caterpillar towards vertex $5$, therefore the caterpillar becomes $(5, 2)$, and vertex $p = 5$ is a leaf, so Nora will win.",

In the two versions, the constraints on $q$ and the time limit are different. In this version, $0 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.\n\nA team consisting of $n$ members, numbered from $1$ to $n$, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains $m$ slides.\n\nThere is an array $a$ of length $n$. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide $1$ to slide $m$. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is $[\\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$. After member $3$ presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either $[\\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$, $[1,\\color{red}{3},2,4]$, $[1,2,\\color{red}{3},4]$ or $[1,2,4,\\color{red}{3}]$.\n\nThere is also an array $b$ of length $m$. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member $b_i$ present slide $i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $m$ under these constraints.\n\nHowever, your annoying boss wants to make $q$ updates to the array $b$. In the $i$-th update, he will choose a slide $s_i$ and a member $t_i$ and set $b_{s_i} := t_i$. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array $b$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nFor each of the $q+1$ states of array $b$, the initial state and after each of the $q$ updates, determine if the slideshow is good.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $0 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of members and the number of sections.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the initial order of the members from front to back. It is guaranteed that each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once in $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the members who should present each section.\n\nEach of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $s_i$ and $t_i$ ($1 \\le s_i \\le m$, $1 \\le t_i \\le n$) -- parameters of an update.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$, the sum of $m$ and the sum of $q$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q+1$ lines corresponding to the $q+1$ states of the array $b$. Output \"YA\" if the slide show is good, and \"TIDAK\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yA\", \"Ya\", \"ya\", and \"YA\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4 2 2\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n1 1\n\n3 6 2\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 2 3 3 2\n\n3 3\n\n2 2\n\n4 6 2\n\n3 1 4 2\n\n3 1 1 2 3 4\n\n3 4\n\n4 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYA\nTIDAK\nYA\nYA\nTIDAK\nYA\nTIDAK\nYA\nYA\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, you do not need to move the members as both slides are presented by member $1$, who is already at the front of the line. After that, set $b_1 := 2$, now slide $1$ must be presented by member $2$ which is impossible as member $1$ will present slide $1$ first. Then, set $b_1 = 1$, the $b$ is the same as the initial $b$, making a good presentation possible.",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $k$ and $m$ ($1 \\le k \\le 200$, $1 \\le m \\le 500$) -- the number of bits in $n$ and the upper bound on the elements in sequence $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $k$ -- the binary representation of $n$ with no leading zeros.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $k$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the bitwise XOR of the median of all good sequences $a$ of length $n$ where $0\\le a_i < m$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n2 3\n\n10\n\n2 3\n\n11\n\n5 1\n\n11101\n\n7 9\n\n1101011\n\n17 34\n\n11001010001010010\n\n1 500\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n2\n0\n8\n32\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, $n = 10_2 = 2$ and $m = 3$.

Some good sequences are $[2, 2, 2]$, $[1, 0, 1]$, and $[2, 0, 1]$. However, a sequence $[2, 0, 0]$ is not good, because $\\text{cnt}_0 = 2$, $\\text{cnt}_2 = 1$.

Looking back at the past, everybody has lived the life they wanted.\n\nAquawave has a matrix $A$ of size $n\\times m$, whose elements can only be integers in the range $[1, k]$, inclusive. In the matrix, some cells are already filled with an integer, while the rest are currently not filled, denoted by $-1$.\n\nYou are going to fill in all the unfilled places in $A$.

Well, no, he likes to flex his research paper on line graphs to everyone more. To start a conversation with you, he decides to give you a problem on line graphs. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of a simple undirected graph $G$ is another simple undirected graph $L(G)$ that represents the adjacency between every two edges in $G$.\n\nPrecisely speaking, for an undirected graph $G$ without self-loops or multiple edges, its line graph $L(G)$ is a graph such that\n\n- Each vertex of $L(G)$ represents an edge of $G$.\n- Two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint in $G$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/7c4456d69ec30bde9274559f9dca34dcf6879258.png)\n\nAlso, $L^0(G)=G$ and $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$ for $k\\geq 1$.\n\nAn Euler trail is a sequence of edges that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. This trail can be either a path (starting and ending at different vertices) or a cycle (starting and ending at the same vertex). Vertices may be revisited during the trail, but each edge must be used exactly once.\n\nAryan gives you a simple connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and an integer $k$, and it is guaranteed that $G$ has an Euler trail and it is not a path graph$^{\\text{∗}}$. He asks you to determine if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler trail.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A path graph is a tree where every vertex is connected to atmost two other vertices.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($5 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n-1 \\le m \\le \\min(\\frac{n\\cdot(n-1)}{2} ,2 \\cdot 10^5)$, $1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u,v \\le n$, $u \\neq v$), denoting that an edge connects vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler trail; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n5 5 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 1\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 1\n\n1 3\n\n10 11 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n4 6\n\n4 7\n\n5 7\n\n6 7\n\n7 8\n\n8 9\n\n9 10\n\n7 8 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 3\n\n1 4\n\n4 5\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n6 7\n\n2 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, $L^2(G)$ is isomorphic to $G$ itself. So, since $G$ has an Euler trail, $L^2(G)$ also has an Euler trail.\n\nFor the second test case, $L(G)$ looks as follows(Vertex $i-j$ of $L(G)$ in figure corresponds to edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$). It can be proven that this doesn't have an Euler trail.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b376c533b0c565921bd0995db02694519661b79c.png)",

Alice and Bob are frogs initially positioned on distinct lilypads, $a$ and $b$, respectively. They take turns jumping, starting with Alice.\n\nDuring a frog's turn, it can jump either one space to the left or one space to the right, as long as the destination lilypad exists. For example, on Alice's first turn, she can jump to either lilypad $a-1$ or $a+1$, provided these lilypads are within bounds. It is important to note that each frog must jump during its turn and cannot remain on the same lilypad.\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions:\n\n- The two frogs cannot occupy the same lilypad. This means that Alice cannot jump to a lilypad that Bob is currently occupying, and vice versa.\n- If a frog cannot make a valid jump on its turn, it loses the game. As a result, the other frog wins.\n\nDetermine whether Alice can guarantee a win, assuming that both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end after a finite number of moves if both players play optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $a$, and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$, $1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$, $a\\neq b$) -- the number of lilypads, and the starting positions of Alice and Bob, respectively.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing either \"YES\" or \"NO\", representing whether or not Alice has a winning strategy.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2 1 2\n\n3 3 1\n\n4 2 3\n\n5 2 4\n\n7 6 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Alice has no legal moves. Therefore, Alice loses on the first turn.\n\nIn the second test case, Alice can only move to lilypad $2$. Then, Bob has no legal moves. Therefore, Alice has a winning strategy in this case.\n\nIn the third test case, Alice can only move to lilypad $1$. Then, Bob can move to lilypad $2$. Alice is no longer able to move and loses, giving Bob the win. It can be shown that Bob can always win regardless of Alice's moves; hence, Alice does not have a winning strategy.",

His friend will sell drinks for $n$ days, numbered from day $1$ to day $n$. There are also $m$ types of drinks, numbered from $1$ to $m$.\n\nThe profit gained from selling a drink on a particular day can vary. On day $i$, the projected profit from selling drink of type $j$ is $A_{i, j}$.

On day $i$, Pak Chanek must choose to sell at least one type of drink. Furthermore, the types of drinks sold on a single day must form a subarray. In other words, in each day, Pak Chanek will select $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m$. Then all types of drinks between $i$ and $j$ (inclusive) will be sold.\n\nHowever, to ensure that customers from the previous day keep returning, the selection of drink types sold on day $i$ ($i>1$) must meet the following conditions:\n\n- At least one drink type sold on day $i$ must also have been sold on day $i-1$.\n- At least one drink type sold on day $i$ must not have been sold on day $i-1$.\n\nThe daily profit is the sum of the profits from all drink types sold on that day.

You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nLeo works as a programmer in the city center, and his lover teaches at a high school in the suburbs. Every weekend, Leo would ride his bike to the suburbs to spend a nice weekend with his lover.\n\nThere are $n$ cyclists riding in front of Leo on this road right now. They are numbered $1$, $2$, $\\ldots$, $n$ from front to back. Initially, Leo is behind the $n$-th cyclist. The $i$-th cyclist has an agility value $a_i$.\n\nLeo wants to get ahead of the $1$-st cyclist. Leo can take the following actions as many times as he wants:\n\n- Assuming that the first person in front of Leo is cyclist $i$, he can go in front of cyclist $i$ for a cost of $a_i$. This puts him behind cyclist $i - 1$.\n- Using his super powers, swap $a_i$ and $a_j$ ($1\\le i < j\\le n$) for a cost of $(j - i)$.\n\nLeo wants to know the minimum cost to get in front of the $1$-st cyclist. Here you only need to print the answer for the whole array, i.e. $[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^3$), representing the number of the cyclists.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5\\cdot 10^3$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer representing the minimum cost for Leo to go from behind the $n$-th cyclist to in front of the $1$-st cyclist.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1 2 4\n\n4\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n4\n\n4 1 3 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n7\n4\n3\n8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one possible way to move from the position behind the $n$-th cyclist to the position in front of the $1$-st cyclist is:\n\n- Leo swaps $a_2$ $(i=2)$ and $a_3$ $(j=3)$, then the array becomes $[1,4,2]$; it costs $j-i=3-2=1$.\n- Leo is behind the $3$-rd cyclist and moves behind the $2$-nd cyclist; it costs $a_3=2$.\n- Leo swaps $a_1$ $(i=1)$ and $a_2$ $(j=2)$, then the array becomes $[4,1,2]$; it costs $j-i=2-1=1$.\n- Leo is behind the $2$-nd cyclist and moves behind the $1$-st cyclist; it costs $a_2=1$.\n- Leo swaps $a_1$ $(i=1)$ and $a_2$ $(j=2)$, then the array becomes $[1,4,2]$; it costs $j-i=2-1=1$.\n- Leo moves ahead of the $1$-st cyclist; it costs $a_1=1$.\n\nSo the total cost is $1+2+1+1+1+1=7$. It can be proved that $7$ is the minimum cost.\n\nIn the second test case, to move ahead of the $1$-st cyclist from the position behind the $n$-th cyclist, Leo should not swap anyone's agility value.

Since the answer could be quite large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nIt is also possible that you made a mistake in your records, and there is no possible way to restore the gaps. In that case, the answer is considered to be $0$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n, c, m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le c \\le 100$, $c \\le m \\le n \\cdot c$) -- the number of floors in the building, the minimum required number of airplanes, and the number of airplanes actually launched.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- $a_i$ indicates the resident from which floor launched the $i$-th airplane; $a_i = 0$ indicates a gap.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of ways to fill in the gaps with numbers from $1$ to $n$, so that the chronology of the airplane launches could be credible, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n3 2 4\n\n0 0 0 0\n\n5 5 7\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n6 1 3\n\n2 0 0\n\n2 3 5\n\n0 0 1 0 2\n\n3 3 4\n\n3 3 3 0\n\n2 1 2\n\n0 1\n\n2 1 2\n\n0 2\n\n5 3 12\n\n0 0 1 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n6\n190\n3\n2\n0\n0\n1\n14\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test example, all six possible ways to fill in the gaps are as follows:\n\n1. $[1, 1, 3, 3]$\n2. $[1, 2, 3, 3]$\n3. $[1, 3, 2, 3]$\n4. $[2, 1, 3, 3]$\n5. $[2, 2, 3, 3]$\n6. $[3, 1, 2, 3]$\n\nNote that the array $[2, 3, 1, 3]$ is not a valid way to fill in the gaps, as the third airplane could not have been launched by the person on the $1$st floor, since from their perspective, $c = 2$ airplanes had already been launched.\n\nAlso, the array $[1, 1, 2, 3]$ is not a valid way to fill in the gaps, as from the perspective of the person on the $3$rd floor, only $1$ airplane has been launched, while $c = 2$.",

The only difference is that you need to output the number of choices of games where Bob wins in this version, where the number of stones in each pile are not fixed. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a familiar game where they take turns removing stones from $n$ piles. Initially, there are $x_i$ stones in the $i$-th pile, and it has an associated value $a_i$. A player can take $d$ stones away from the $i$-th pile if and only if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- $1 \\le d \\le a_i$, and\n- $x \\, \\& \\, d = d$, where $x$ is the current number of stones in the $i$-th pile and $\\&$ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).\n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses, and Alice goes first.\n\nYou're given the $a_i$ values of each pile, but the number of stones in the $i$-th pile has not been determined yet. For the $i$-th pile, $x_i$ can be any integer between $1$ and $b_i$, inclusive. That is, you can choose an array $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ such that the condition $1 \\le x_i \\le b_i$ is satisfied for all piles.\n\nYour task is to count the number of games where Bob wins if both players play optimally. Two games are considered different if the number of stones in any pile is different, i.e., the arrays of $x$ differ in at least one position.\n\nSince the answer can be very large, please output the result modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

If $x_1 = 2$, then no stones can be taken from it, so Bob will make the last move. If $x_1 = 1$ or $x_1 = 3$, then exactly one move can be made on that pile, so Alice will make the last move. So Bob wins when $x = [2, 1, 1]$ or $x = [2, 1, 2]$ or $x = [2, 2, 1]$ or $x = [2, 2, 2]$.\n\nIn the second test case, Bob wins when $x_1 = 14$ or $x_1 = 30$ by removing $14 - k$ stones, where $k$ is the number of stones Alice removes on her turn. Bob also wins when $x_1 = 16$ or $x_1 = 32$ since Alice does not have any moves to begin with.",

For his birthday, Kohane wants to combine them with a gift: $n$ BBQ buns arranged from left to right. There are $10^6$ available fillings of BBQ buns, numbered from $1$ to $10^6$. To ensure that Penchick would love this gift, Kohane has a few goals:\n\n- No filling is used exactly once; that is, each filling must either not appear at all or appear at least twice.\n- For any two buns $i$ and $j$ that have the same filling, the distance between them, which is $|i-j|$, must be a perfect square$^{\\text{∗}}$.\n\nHelp Kohane find a valid way to choose the filling of the buns, or determine if it is impossible to satisfy her goals! If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A positive integer $x$ is a perfect square if there exists a positive integer $y$ such that $x = y^2$. For example, $49$ and $1$ are perfect squares because $49 = 7^2$ and $1 = 1^2$ respectively. On the other hand, $5$ is not a perfect square as no integer squared equals $5$\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Otherwise, output $n$ integers, where the $i$-th integer represents the filling of the $i$-th BBQ bun. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3\n\n12\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1\n1 2 3 6 10 2 7 6 10 1 7 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the choice of fillings \"1 1 1\" is not allowed because buns $1$ and $3$ have the same filling, but are distance $2$ apart, which is not a perfect square. The choice of fillings \"1 1 2\" is also not allowed as filling $2$ is only used once.\n\nIn the second test case, the solution is valid because no filling is used exactly once, and any two buns with the same filling are spaced at a distance equal to a perfect square. For example, buns $1$ and $10$ both have filling $1$ and are spaced at a distance of $9=3^2$. Similarly, buns $5$ and $9$ both have filling $10$ and are spaced at a distance of $4=2^2$.",

But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.\n\nThere are $n+m$ distinct points $(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \\ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \\ldots, (b_{m},2)$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $0$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose three distinct points which are not [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity);\n- Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;\n- Then, erase the three points from the plane.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5f6a73286fffbc2708f1d388ed58ca5bc0d69d23.png)An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice.\n\nLet $k_{\\max}$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $k_\\max$ is $0$. Additionally, define $f(k)$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $k$ times. Here, $f(k)$ is defined for all integers $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le k_{\\max}$.\n\nFind the value of $k_{\\max}$, and find the values of $f(x)$ for all integers $x=1,2,\\ldots,k_{\\max}$ independently.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le {3 \\cdot 10^4}$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n}$ -- the points on $y=0$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ pairwise distinct integers $b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_{m}$ -- the points on $y=2$ ($-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $k_{\\max}$, you must output at most two lines:\n\n- The first line contains the value of $k_{\\max}$;\n- The second line contains $k_{\\max}$ integers denoting $f(1),f(2),\\ldots,f(k_{\\max})$. You are allowed to omit this line if $k_{\\max}$ is $0$.\n\nNote that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $f(x)$ are integers no greater than $10^{16}$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 3\n\n0\n\n0 1 -1\n\n2 4\n\n0 100\n\n-100 -50 0 50\n\n2 4\n\n0 1000\n\n-100 -50 0 50\n\n6 6\n\n20 1 27 100 43 42\n\n100 84 1 24 22 77\n\n8 2\n\n564040265 -509489796 469913620 198872582 -400714529 553177666 131159391 -20796763\n\n-1000000000 1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n150 200\n2\n1000 200\n4\n99 198 260 283\n2\n2000000000 2027422256\n```\n\n### Note\n\nOn the first test case, there are $1+3=4$ points $(0,0),(0,2),(1,2),(-1,2)$.\n\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform two or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $1$, and you are only asked for the value of $f(1)$.\n\nYou can choose $(0,0)$, $(-1,2)$, and $(1,2)$ as the three vertices of the triangle. After that, your score is increased by the area of the triangle, which is $2$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2$.\n\nOn the fifth test case, there are $8+2=10$ points.\n\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform three or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $2$, and you are asked for the values $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\n\nTo maximize the score with only one operation, you can choose three points $(198\\,872\\,582,0)$, $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$.\n\nTo maximize the score with exactly two operations, you can choose the following sequence of operations.\n\n- Choose three points $(-509\\,489\\,796,0)$, $(553\\,177\\,666,0)$, and $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased.\n- Choose three points $(-400\\,714\\,529,0)$, $(564\\,040\\,265,0)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased.\n\nThen, the score after two operations becomes $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing exactly two operations is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$.",

For example, $f(\\texttt{00110001}) = 4$ because $t$ can be partitioned as $\\texttt{[00][11][000][1]}$ where each bracketed segment consists of identical characters.\n\nSkibidus gives you a binary string $s$ and $q$ queries. In each query, a single character of the string is flipped (i.e. $\\texttt{0}$ changes to $\\texttt{1}$ and $\\texttt{1}$ changes to $\\texttt{0}$); changes are saved after the query is processed. After each query, output the sum over all $f(b)$ where $b$ is a non-empty subsequence$^{\\text{†}}$ of $s$, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A binary string consists of only characters $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A subsequence of a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ ($1 \\leq |s| \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe following line of each test case contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of queries.\n\nThe following line contains $q$ integers $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_q$ ($1 \\leq v_i \\leq |s|$), denoting $s_{v_i}$ is flipped for the $i$'th query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q$ integers on a single line -- the answer after each query modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n101\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n10110\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n101110101\n\n5\n\n7 2 4 4 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n10 7\n61 59 67\n1495 1169 1417 1169 1396\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $s$ becomes $\\texttt{001}$ after the first query. Let's calculate the answer for each subsequence:\n\n- $f(s_1) = f(\\texttt{0}) = 1$\n- $f(s_2) = f(\\texttt{0}) = 1$\n- $f(s_3) = f(\\texttt{1}) = 1$\n- $f(s_1 s_2) = f(\\texttt{00}) = 1$\n- $f(s_1 s_3) = f(\\texttt{01}) = 2$\n- $f(s_2 s_3) = f(\\texttt{01}) = 2$\n- $f(s_1 s_2 s_3) = f(\\texttt{001}) = 2$\n\nThe sum of these values is $10$, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.",

Naturally, he's sending it back in the most inconvenient manner possible.\n\nA crow is sitting at position $0$ of the number line. There are $n$ scarecrows positioned at integer coordinates $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ along the number line. These scarecrows have been enchanted, allowing them to move left and right at a speed of $1$ unit per second.\n\nThe crow is afraid of scarecrows and wants to stay at least a distance of $k$ ahead of the nearest scarecrow positioned at or before it. To do so, the crow uses its teleportation ability as follows:\n\n- Let $x$ be the current position of the crow, and let $y$ be the largest position of a scarecrow such that $y \\le x$. If $x - y < k$, meaning the scarecrow is too close, the crow will instantly teleport to position $y + k$.\n\nThis teleportation happens instantly and continuously. The crow will keep checking for scarecrows positioned at or to the left of him and teleport whenever one gets too close (which could happen at non-integral times). Note that besides this teleportation ability, the crow will not move on its own.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum time required to make the crow teleport to a position greater than or equal to $\\ell$, assuming the scarecrows move optimally to allow the crow to reach its goal. For convenience, you are asked to output twice the minimum time needed for the crow to reach the target position $\\ell$. It can be proven that this value will always be an integer.\n\nNote that the scarecrows can start, stop, or change direction at any time (possibly at non-integral times).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n, k, \\ell$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq \\ell \\leq 10^8$) -- the number of scarecrows, the teleportation distance, and the target position of the crow, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\leq a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_n \\leq \\ell$) -- the initial positions of the $n$ scarecrows.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the twice the minimum time required for the crow to teleport to a position greater than or equal to $\\ell$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n1 3 5\n\n0\n\n3 2 5\n\n2 5 5\n\n1 10 10\n\n10\n\n10 1 10\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n2 1 2\n\n0 0\n\n2 1 2\n\n0 2\n\n2 1 3\n\n0 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 1\n\n9 12 54\n\n3 3 8 24 25 27 29 34 53\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n5\n20\n0\n2\n1\n2\n2\n7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the crow instantly teleports to position $3$ due to the scarecrow at position $0$. This scarecrow may then move to position $2$, causing the crow to continuously move from position $3$ to position $5$, completing the trip in $2$ seconds. Therefore, the output is $4$.\n\nIn the second test case, scarecrow $1$ and scarecrow $2$ can move to positions $0$ and $3$, respectively, in $2$ seconds, while scarecrow $3$ remains at position $5$. The crow teleports to position $2$ due to scarecrow $1$. Then, scarecrow $1$ moves to the right while scarecrow $2$ and scarecrow $3$ move to the left for $0.5$ seconds. This causes the crow to continuously move from position $2$ to position $2.5$ due to scarecrow $1$ moving right from position $0$. After this half second, the scarecrows will be at positions $0.5, 2.5, 4.5$. Scarecrow $2$, now at position $2.5$, causes the crow to instantly teleport to position $4.5$, and scarecrow $3$ at position $4.5$ causes it to instantly teleport to position $6.5$, which exceeds $\\ell = 5$. Therefore, the crow finishes the trip in just $2.5$ seconds, and the output is $5$.\n\nIt can be shown that these are the minimum possible times for both test cases.",

Players take turns making moves, with Alice going first.\n\nOn each move, the player does the following three-step process:\n\n1. Choose an integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq \\frac n 2$).

Since neither $1$ nor $2$ can be split into two prime numbers, Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.\n\nIn the second test case, there are $3$ piles of stones with $3$, $5$, and $7$ stones respectively. Alice can choose $k = 1$, remove the pile of $7$ stones, and then split the pile of $5$ stones into two piles of prime numbers of stones, $2$ and $3$. Then, the piles consist of $3$ piles of stones with $3$, $2$, and $3$ stones respectively, leaving Bob with no valid moves, so Alice wins.\n\nIn the third test case, there are $4$ piles of stones with $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$ stones respectively. Alice can choose $k = 2$, removing two piles of $8$ and $10$ stones. She splits the pile of $4$ stones into two piles of prime numbers of stones, $2$ and $2$, and the pile of $6$ stones into two piles of $3$ and $3$ stones. Then, Bob has no valid moves, so Alice wins.\n\nIn the fourth test case, there are $5$ piles of stones, each containing $8$ stones.

To enter one of these rooms, you must unlock a circular lock by selecting the correct code. This code is updated every day.\n\nToday's code is a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ of the numbers from $1$ to $n$, with the property that in every cyclic shift$^{\\text{†}}$ of it, there is exactly one fixed point.

You can apply several (possibly zero) operations to the sequence. In each operation, you select two integers $1\\le l\\le r\\le |a|$ (where $|a|$ is the current length of $a$) and replace $[a_l,\\ldots,a_r]$ with a single element $x$, where $x$ is the majority of $[a_l,\\ldots,a_r]$.\n\nHere, the majority of a sequence consisting of $0$ and $1$ is defined as follows: suppose there are $c_0$ zeros and $c_1$ ones in the sequence, respectively.\n\n- If $c_0\\ge c_1$, the majority is $0$.\n- If $c_0<c_1$, the majority is $1$.\n\nFor example, suppose $a=[1,0,0,0,1,1]$.

In particular, flying in airplanes brings him extraordinary pleasure. He was about to fly to another city, but the runway was heavily covered with snow and needed to be cleared.\n\nThe runway can be represented as $n$ consecutive sections numbered from $1$ to $n$. The snowstorm was quite strong, but it has already stopped, so Vasya managed to calculate that the $i$-th section is covered with $a_i$ meters of snow. For such situations, the airport has a snowplow that works in a rather unusual way. In one minute, the snowplow can do the following:\n\n- Choose a consecutive segment of length no more than $d$ and remove one meter of snow from the most snow-covered sections.\nFormally, one can choose $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$ ($r - l + 1 \\le d$). After that, $c = \\max \\{ a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots , a_r \\}$ is calculated, and if $c > 0$, then for all $i \\colon l \\le i \\le r$ such that $a_i = c$, the value of $a_i$ is decreased by one.\n\n\nVasya has been preparing for the flight for a long time and wants to understand how much time he has left to wait until all sections are completely cleared of snow. In other words, it is required to calculate the minimum number of minutes that the snowplow will need to achieve $a_i = 0$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le d \\le n$) -- the number of sections on the runway and the maximum length of the segment that the snowplow can choose.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the number of meters of snow on the $i$-th section.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of minutes required for the snowplow to achieve $a_i = 0$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n5 2\n\n1 5 2 1 2\n\n3 1\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n8\n3000000000\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is an optimal sequence of operations. First, select the segment $[2, 3]$ four times. After three operations, $a_2$ will turn into $2$, and the array $a$ will look like $[1, 2, 2, 1, 2]$. After the fourth operation, the array $a$ will become $[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$. Next, the array can be transformed into zeros by selecting the segments $[1, 2]$, $[3, 3]$, $[5, 5]$, and $[4, 5]$ (in that exact order).\n\nIn the second test case, $d = 1$, which means that each section is cleared independently of the others, and the answer is equal to the sum of all $a_i$.",

Find the perimeter of this colored shape.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $2 \\le m \\le 100$) -- the number of operations performed and the side length of the square stamp.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le m - 1$) -- the distance that the stamp will be moved right and up during the $i$-th operation, respectively.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer representing the perimeter of the colored shape on the paper.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4 3\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n1 1\n\n6 7\n\n3 6\n\n1 1\n\n3 1\n\n6 6\n\n5 4\n\n6 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n32\n8\n96\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, the stamp has a side length of $3$ and is pressed $4$ times at coordinates $(1, 1)$, $(3, 3)$, $(5, 4)$, and $(6, 6)$. The piece of paper looks like that afterwards:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/9fc3f24b6fa5d2b61c12e4b03034cf4461356a4e.png)\n\nHere, the square formed by the first press is colored blue, the second red, the third green, and the fourth purple. The combined shape, whose perimeter we need to calculate, looks like that:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d3769976097a17e12f245e090e7d4b21ac6d0111.png)\n\nFrom the diagram, it can be seen that this shape has a perimeter of $32$.",

If you decide to remove the digits $1$, $4$, and one digit $5$, you will end up with the number $035$, whose cost is $\\frac{035}{0 + 3 + 5} = 4.375$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of digits you need to remove from the number so that its cost becomes the minimum possible?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a positive integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n < 10^{100}$) without leading zeros.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer on a new line -- the number of digits that need to be removed from the number so that its cost becomes minimal.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n666\n\n13700\n\n102030\n\n7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n4\n3\n0\n```",

That is, the elements of array $A$ were first written into array $C$, followed by the elements of array $B$.\n\nYou can ask the kind spirit up to $250$ questions. Each question contains an index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n$). In response, you will receive the $i$-th element of the concatenated array $C$.\n\nYou need to find the lengths of arrays $A$ and $B$, or report that it is impossible to determine them uniquely.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The answer is not counted when counting the number of queries.\n\nIf it is impossible to determine the lengths of the arrays uniquely, output \"! -1\" (without quotes). Note that if you answer $-1$ while there is a sequence of at most $250$ queries that uniquely determines the lengths of arrays, you will get a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are arrays $A$ and $B$ that do not contradict the statement, for which the interactor output is correct.\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive, which means that the answer is known before the participant makes queries and does not depend on the queries made by the participant.\n\nIf your program makes more than $250$ queries, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive a verdict of \"IL\" (Idleness limit exceeded). To flush the buffer, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- see the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nHacks are disabled for this problem.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n6\n5 2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n18 4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3 1\n\n10 5\n\n9 3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n12 4\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n\n? 1\n\n? 2\n\n? 3\n\n! 2 3\n\n? 9\n\n? 13\n\n? 10\n\n? 14\n\n? 6\n\n! 9 9\n\n! -1\n\n! 5 5\n\n? 3\n\n? 6\n\n? 9\n\n! 6 3\n\n? 1\n\n? 2\n\n? 5\n\n? 6\n\n? 9\n\n? 10\n\n! -1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nConsider the first example. We queried the first $3$ elements out of $5$. Now we know that the array $C$ looks like $[1, 2, 2, ?, ?]$. We know for sure that the third element is not from array $A$ -- because according to the condition, any $k$ consecutive elements (in our case $k = 2$) in array $A$ are different. Thus, the third element is definitely located in array $B$. This means that the length of array $A$ is $2$, and the length of array $B$ is $3$.\n\nThe picture shows arrays from all test cases.

Thus, the answer is $0$.\n\nIn the second test case, we can swap $a_1$ and $a_2$ to obtain $[1, \\underline{2, 1, 3}, 1, 1, 2]$, which has a colorful subarray $[a_2, a_3, a_4] = [2, 1, 3]$. And the given array initially does not have any colorful subarrays, so the answer is $1$.",

Your task is to select two non-empty substrings$^{\\text{∗}}$ of $s$ (which can be overlapped) to maximize the XOR value of these two substrings.\n\nThe XOR of two binary strings $a$ and $b$ is defined as the result of the $\\oplus$ operation applied to the two numbers obtained by interpreting $a$ and $b$ as binary numbers, with the leftmost bit representing the highest value. Here, $\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nThe strings you choose may have leading zeros.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A string $a$ is a substring of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$).\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ that starts with 1 ($1\\le\\lvert s\\rvert\\le 5000$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $\\lvert s\\rvert$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output four integers $l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2$ ($1 \\le l_1 \\le r_1 \\le |s|$, $1 \\le l_2 \\le r_2 \\le |s|$) -- in the case the two substrings you selected are $s_{l_1} s_{l_1 + 1} \\ldots s_{r_1}$ and $s_{l_2} s_{l_2 + 1} \\ldots s_{r_2}$.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n111\n\n1000\n\n10111\n\n11101\n\n1100010001101\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2 2 1 3\n1 3 1 4\n1 5 1 4\n3 4 1 5\n1 13 1 11\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, we can choose $ s_2=\\texttt{1} $ and $ s_1 s_2 s_3=\\texttt{111} $, and $ \\texttt{1}\\oplus\\texttt{111}=\\texttt{110} $.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, $t \\le 10^4$, $n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$ and the sum of $n$ does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nFor a non-empty sequence $c$ of length $k$, define $f(c)$ as follows:\n\n- Turtle and Piggy are playing a game on a sequence. They are given the sequence $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the third, etc.).\n- The game goes as follows:\n- Let the current length of the sequence be $m$. If $m = 1$, the game ends.\n- If the game does not end and it's Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m - 1$, set $c_i$ to $\\min(c_i, c_{i + 1})$, and remove $c_{i + 1}$.\n- If the game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le m - 1$, set $c_i$ to $\\max(c_i, c_{i + 1})$, and remove $c_{i + 1}$.\n- Turtle wants to maximize the value of $c_1$ in the end, while Piggy wants to minimize the value of $c_1$ in the end.\n- $f(c)$ is the value of $c_1$ in the end if both players play optimally.\n\nFor a permutation $p$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$, Turtle defines the beauty of the permutation as $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n \\sum\\limits_{j = i}^n f([p_i, p_{i + 1}, \\ldots, p_j])$ (i.e., the sum of $f(c)$ where $c$ is a non-empty subsegment$^{\\text{†}}$ of $p$).\n\nPiggy gives Turtle a permutation $a$ of length $n$ where some elements are missing and represented by $0$.\n\nTurtle asks you to determine a permutation $b$ of length $n$ such that:\n\n- $b$ can be formed by filling in the missing elements of $a$ (i.e., for all $1 \\le i \\le n$, if $a_i \\ne 0$, then $b_i = a_i$).\n- The beauty of the permutation $b$ is maximized.\n\nFor convenience, you only need to find the maximum beauty of such permutation $b$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A sequence $a$ is a subsegment of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that the elements of $a$ that are not $0$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum beauty of the permutation $b$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n0 0 0\n\n3\n\n0 1 0\n\n5\n\n3 2 4 5 1\n\n7\n\n0 3 2 5 0 0 0\n\n10\n\n1 2 6 5 8 9 0 0 0 0\n\n5\n\n0 4 1 0 0\n\n5\n\n0 1 5 2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n12\n11\n44\n110\n300\n45\n40\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the permutation $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[1, 2]$. The beauty of $[1, 2]$ is $4$ since $f([1]) + f([2]) + f([1, 2]) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. If $c = [1, 2]$, then $f(c) = 1$ since Turtle can only choose $i = 1$ and he will set $c_1$ to $\\min(c_1, c_2) = 1$.\n\nIn the second test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[3, 2, 1]$. The beauty of $[3, 2, 1]$ is $12$ since $f([3]) + f([2]) + f([1]) + f([3, 2]) + f([2, 1]) + f([3, 2, 1]) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 12$.\n\nIn the third test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[2, 1, 3]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, if $c = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]$, then $f(c) = 3$. One of the possible game processes is as follows:\n\n- Turtle can choose $i = 3$. Then he will set $c_3$ to $\\min(c_3, c_4) = 4$ and remove $c_4$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 2, 4, 1]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i = 1$. Then he will set $c_1$ to $\\max(c_1, c_2) = 3$ and remove $c_2$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 4, 1]$.\n- Turtle can choose $i = 2$. Then he will set $c_2$ to $\\min(c_2, c_3) = 1$ and remove $c_3$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3, 1]$.\n- Piggy can choose $i = 1$. Then he will set $c_1$ to $\\max(c_1, c_2) = 3$ and remove $c_2$. The sequence $c$ will become $[3]$.\n- The length of the sequence becomes $1$, so the game will end. The value of $c_1$ will be $3$ in the end.\n\nIn the fifth test case, one of the permutations $b$ with the maximum beauty is $[1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7]$.",

Each component (a light or a switch) has two states: on or off. The lights and switches are arranged in a way that:\n\n- Each light is connected to exactly two switches.\n- Each switch is connected to exactly one light. It's unknown which light each switch is connected to.\n- When all switches are off, all lights are also off.\n- If a switch is toggled (from on to off, or vice versa), the state of the light connected to it will also toggle.\n\nAlice brings the circuit, which shows only the states of the $2n$ switches, to her sister Iris and gives her a riddle: what is the minimum and maximum number of lights that can be turned on?\n\nKnowing her little sister's antics too well, Iris takes no more than a second to give Alice a correct answer. Can you do the same?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$) -- the number of lights in the circuit.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2n}$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$) -- the states of the switches in the circuit. $a_i = 0$ means the $i$-th switch is off, and $a_i = 1$ means the $i$-th switch is on.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output two integers -- the minimum and maximum number of lights, respectively, that can be turned on.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0 0\n\n1\n\n0 1\n\n1\n\n1 1\n\n3\n\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n\n3\n\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 0\n1 1\n0 0\n0 2\n1 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is only one light in the circuit, and no switch is on, so the light is certainly off.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one light in the circuit, but one switch connected to it is on, so the light is on.\n\nIn the third test case, there is only one light in the circuit, and both switches are on, so the light is off as it was toggled twice.\n\nIn the fourth test case, to have no lights on, the switches can be arranged in this way:\n\n- Switch $1$ and switch $4$ are connected to light $1$. Since both switches are off, light $1$ is also off.\n- Switch $2$ and switch $6$ are connected to light $2$. Since both switches are off, light $2$ is also off.\n- Switch $3$ and switch $5$ are connected to light $3$. Both switches are on, so light $3$ is toggled twice from its initial off state, and thus also stays off.\n\nAnd to have $2$ lights on, the switches can be arranged in this way:\n\n- Switch $1$ and switch $2$ are connected to light $1$. Since both switches are off, light $1$ is also off.\n- Switch $3$ and switch $4$ are connected to light $2$. Since switch $3$ is on and switch $4$ is off, light $2$ is toggled once from its initial off state, so it is on.\n- Switch $5$ and switch $6$ are connected to light $3$. Since switch $5$ is on and switch $6$ is off, light $3$ is toggled once from its initial off state, so it is on.",

Kevin remembers all the participants and all the contest problems from that time, but he has forgotten the specific rounds, the distribution of problems, and the exact rankings.\n\nThere are $ m $ problems in total, with the $ i $-th problem having a difficulty of $ b_i $. Let each contest consist of $ k $ problems, resulting in a total of $ \\lfloor \\frac{m}{k} \\rfloor $ contests. This means that you select exactly $ \\lfloor \\frac{m}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k $ problems for the contests in any combination you want, with each problem being selected at most once, and the remaining $m\\bmod k$ problems are left unused. For example, if $m = 17$ and $k = 3$, you should create exactly $5$ contests consisting of $3$ problems each, and exactly $2$ problems will be left unused.\n\nThere are $ n $ participants in the contests, with Kevin being the $1$-st participant. The $ i $-th participant has a rating of $ a_i $. During the contests, each participant solves all problems with a difficulty not exceeding their rating, meaning the $ i $-th participant solves the $ j $-th problem if and only if $ a_i \\geq b_j $. In each contest, Kevin's rank is one plus the number of participants who solve more problems than he does.\n\nFor each $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, m $, Kevin wants to know the minimum sum of his ranks across all $ \\lfloor \\frac{m}{k} \\rfloor $ contests. In other words, for some value of $k$, after selecting the problems for each contest, you calculate the rank of Kevin in each contest and sum up these ranks over all $ \\lfloor \\frac{m}{k} \\rfloor $ contests. Your goal is to minimize this value.\n\nNote that contests for different values of $k$ are independent. It means that for different values of $k$, you can select the distribution of problems into the contests independently.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ($ 1 \\le t \\le 5\\cdot 10^4 $).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ($ 1 \\le n, m \\leq 3\\cdot 10^5 $) -- the number of participants and the number of problems.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ($ 0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $) -- the rating of each participant.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $ m $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m $ ($ 0 \\le b_i \\le 10^9 $) -- the difficulty of each problem.\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $ n $ and the sum of $ m $ over all test cases do not exceed $ 3 \\cdot 10^5 $.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $m$ integers -- the minimum sum of Kevin's ranks for each $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n4 4\n\n4 3 7 5\n\n2 5 4 6\n\n5 5\n\n5 0 4 8 6\n\n1 3 9 2 7\n\n6 7\n\n1 1 4 5 1 4\n\n1 9 1 9 8 1 0\n\n7 6\n\n1 9 1 9 8 1 0\n\n1 1 4 5 1 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n7 4 2 3\n6 2 1 1 2\n7 3 2 1 1 1 1\n15 9 5 4 4 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case:\n\nWhen $k=1$, since each contest only contains one problem, the distribution is in fact unique. For example, in the contest which only includes the third problem (which has a difficulty of $4$), all participants except the $2$-nd can solve it. Since no one solves strictly more problems than Kevin, his ranking in this contest is $1$. Similarly, in all $4$ contests, Kevin's rankings are $1,3,1,2$, and the sum is $7$.\n\nWhen $k=2$, one optimal way is to choose the $1$-st and the $3$-rd problem to form a contest, while the $2$-nd and $4$-th for another. In the former contest, $4$ participants respectively solve $2,1,2,2$ problems, so Kevin's ranking is $1$; in the latter one, they respectively solve $0,0,2,1$, since there are $2$ participants ($3$-rd and $4$-th) solve more problems than Kevin, his ranking is $1+2=3$. Thus the answer is $1+3=4$. It can be proven that there's no way to achieve a lower sum.\n\nWhen $k=3$, we can simply choose the $1$-st, the $3$-rd, and the $4$-th problem to make a contest, and Kevin has a ranking of $2$, which is optimal.\n\nWhen $k=4$, since there's only one contest, the distribution is also unique, and Kevin's ranking is $3$.",

Initially, all of the lightbulbs are turned off, except for one lightbulb, where you buried your proudest treasure.\n\nIn order to hide your treasure's position, you perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- Choose two integer numbers $x$ and $y$, and switch the state of the $4$ lightbulbs at $(x, y)$, $(x, y + 1)$, $(x + 1, y - 1)$, and $(x + 1, y)$. In other words, for each lightbulb, turn it on if it was off, and turn it off if it was on. Note that there are no constraints on $x$ and $y$.\n\nIn the end, there are $n$ lightbulbs turned on at coordinates $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$.

Then, you did not perform any operations.\n\nIn the end, only the lightbulb at $(2, 3)$ is turned on.\n\nFor the second test case, one possible scenario is that you hid your treasure at position $(-2, -2)$. Then, you performed $1$ operation with $x = -2$, $y = -2$.\n\nThe operation switches the state of the $4$ lightbulbs at $(-2, -2)$, $(-2, -1)$, $(-1, -3)$, and $(-1, -2)$.\n\nIn the end, the lightbulbs at $(-2, -1)$, $(-1, -2)$, and $(-1, -3)$ are turned on.",

Farmer John has a deck of $n \\cdot m$ cards numbered from $0$ to $n \\cdot m-1$. He distributes $m$ cards to each of his $n$ cows.\n\nFarmer John wants the game to be fair, so each cow should only be able to play $1$ card per round. He decides to determine a turn order, determined by a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ of length $n$, such that the $p_i$'th cow will be the $i$'th cow to place a card on top of the center pile in a round.\n\nIn other words, the following events happen in order in each round:\n\n- The $p_1$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n- The $p_2$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n- ...\n- The $p_n$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n\nThere is a catch. Initially, the center pile contains a card numbered $-1$. In order to place a card, the number of the card must be greater than the number of the card on top of the center pile. Then, the newly placed card becomes the top card of the center pile. If a cow cannot place any card in their deck, the game is considered to be lost.\n\nFarmer John wonders: does there exist $p$ such that it is possible for all of his cows to empty their deck after playing all $m$ rounds of the game? If so, output any valid $p$. Otherwise, output $-1$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ contains each integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 400$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 2\\,000$) -- the number of cows and the number of cards each cow receives.\n\nThe following $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each -- the cards received by each cow. It is guaranteed all given numbers (across all $n$ lines) are distinct and in the range from $0$ to $n \\cdot m - 1$, inclusive.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\,000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the following on a new line:\n\n- If $p$ exists, output $n$ space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$.\n- Otherwise, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 3\n\n0 4 2\n\n1 5 3\n\n1 1\n\n0\n\n2 2\n\n1 2\n\n0 3\n\n4 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2\n1\n-1\n3 1 2 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one turn order that allows all cards to be played is by having the first cow go before the second cow. The cards played will be $0\\rightarrow1\\rightarrow2\\rightarrow3\\rightarrow4\\rightarrow5$.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one cow, so having the cow play all of her cards in increasing order will empty the deck.\n\nIn the third test case, it can be shown there is no valid turn order that allows all cards to be played.",

When such a sleeper is reawakened, what kind of surprises will be waiting?\n\nM received her toy box as a birthday present from her mother. A jewellery designer would definitely spare no effort in decorating yet another priceless masterpiece as a starry firmament with exquisitely shaped gemstones. In addition, $l$ distinct locks secure the tiny universe of her lovely daughter: a hair clip featuring a flower design, a weathered feather pen, a balloon shaped like the letter M ... each piece obscures a precious moment.\n\nA few days ago, M rediscovered her toy box when she was reorganizing her bedroom, along with a ring of keys uniquely designed for the toy box. Attached to the key ring are $(l + k)$ keys, of which $l$ keys are able to open one of the $l$ locks correspondingly, while the other $k$ keys are nothing but counterfeits to discourage brute-force attack. To remind the correspondence, M's mother adorned each key with a gemstone of a different type. However, passing days have faded M's memory away.\n\n\"...

If there are multiple such pairs, a member will randomly choose one of such pairs with equal probability. Apparently, if a lock has been matched with a key, then neither the lock nor the key will be chosen again in following attempts.\n\nAssume that at the very beginning, the probability that a lock can be opened by any key is equal. If everyone always tries the optimal pairs of keys and locks based on all the historical trials, what will the expected number of successful matches be for each member?\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Kazan can be represented as an undirected tree consisting of $n$ vertices. In his youth, Marat often got into street fights, and now he has $m$ enemies, numbered from $1$ to $m$, living in Kazan along with him.\n\nEvery day, all the people living in the city go to work. Marat knows that the $i$-th of his enemies lives at vertex $a_i$ and works at vertex $b_i$. He himself lives at vertex $x$ and works at vertex $y$. It is guaranteed that $a_i \\ne x$.\n\nAll enemies go to work via the shortest path and leave their homes at time $1$. That is, if we represent the shortest path between vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$ as $c_1, c_2, c_3, \\ldots, c_k$ (where $c_1 = a_i$ and $c_k = b_i$), then at the moment $p$ ($1 \\le p \\le k$), the enemy numbered $i$ will be at vertex $c_p$.\n\nMarat really does not want to meet any of his enemies at the same vertex at the same time, as this would create an awkward situation, but they can meet on an edge. Marat also leaves his home at time $1$, and at each subsequent moment in time, he can either move to an adjacent vertex or stay at his current one.\n\nNote that Marat can only meet the $i$-th enemy at the moments $2, 3, \\ldots, k$ (where $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$ is the shortest path between vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$). In other words, starting from the moment after the enemy reaches work, Marat can no longer meet him.\n\nHelp Marat find the earliest moment in time when he can reach work without encountering any enemies along the way, or determine that it is impossible.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Note that Marat will meet a single enemy on an edge, not at a vertex.\n\nIn the second test case, the optimal strategy is to wait for one moment in time at the starting vertex and then go along the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $5$. If he does not stop at the beginning, Marat will meet his enemy at a vertex, not on an edge.\n\nIn the third test case, it is beneficial to go from vertex $1$ to vertex $4$. After that, he should not move anywhere for one moment in time, and then go along the shortest path from vertex $4$ to vertex $9$.",

In other words, output such an integer $e_i$ that $0 \\le x < M$ and $e_i \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 1 4\n\n3 2 0\n\n25 2 5\n\n4 102 9\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n800000006 800000006 400000003\n500000004 1 500000004\n142857144 166666668 615646263 639455787 234126986 257936510 195918369 502040820 478316330 81264173 190523433 471438023 23809524 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n568832210 85779764 969938175 375449967\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, there is only $1$ lock, so the strategy will always be choosing any key that no one has ever tried. Since there are $1 + 4 = 5$ keys in total, the probability that each member successfully opens the lock will be $2/5, 2/5, 1/5$ respectively, which are also the expected numbers of successful matches.\n\nFor the second test case, there are exactly $2$ locks and $2$ keys, with each key corresponding to one of the locks. Without extra information, the first member randomly chooses a key and a lock with equal probabilities, for which the probability of success is $1/2$.\n\n- If the first member succeeds, the second member will open the other lock with the other key.\n- If the first member fails, then the key she selected can open the other lock, and the other key must correspond to the lock she chose. This information allows both the second and the third member to open a lock.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected numbers of successful matches will be:\n\n\n\n$$ \\begin{split} e_1 &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\times 0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\equiv 500,000,004 \\pmod {10^9+7},\\\\ e_2 &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = 1,\\\\ e_3 &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\equiv 500,000,004\\pmod {10^9+7}. \\end{split} $$",

The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $n$ and $t$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size $2^n - 1$, with nodes numbered from $1$ to $2^n-1$ and rooted at $1$. For each vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$), vertex $2v$ is its left child and vertex $2v + 1$ is its right child. Each node $v$ also has a value $a_v$ assigned to it.\n\nDefine the operation $\\mathrm{pop}$ as follows:\n\n1. initialize variable $v$ as $1$;\n2. repeat the following process until vertex $v$ is a leaf (i.e. until $2^{n - 1} \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$);\n1. among the children of $v$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $x$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$), you can choose any of them;\n2. assign $a_x$ to $a_v$ (i.e. $a_v := a_x$);\n3. assign $x$ to $v$ (i.e. $v := x$);\n3. assign $-1$ to $a_v$ (i.e. $a_v := -1$).\n\nThen we say the $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $a_{2v} \\neq a_{2v + 1}$ would hold whenever choosing between them.\n\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$), both $a_v \\ge a_{2v}$ and $a_v \\ge a_{2v + 1}$ hold.\n\nA max-heap is deterministic if the $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.\n\nInitially, $a_v := 0$ for every vertex $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $\\mathrm{add}$ exactly $k$ times:\n\n- Choose an integer $v$ ($1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$) and, for every vertex $x$ on the path between $1$ and $v$, add $1$ to $a_x$.\n\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\n\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo $p$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n, k, p$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 500$, $10^8 \\le p \\le 10^9$, $p$ is a prime).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $k$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation $\\mathrm{add}$ exactly $k$ times, modulo $p$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n1 13 998244353\n\n2 1 998244353\n\n3 2 998244853\n\n3 3 998244353\n\n3 4 100000037\n\n4 2 100000039\n\n4 3 100000037\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n12\n52\n124\n32\n304\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n1\n\n500 500 100000007\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n76297230\n```\n\n#### Input #3\n\n```\n\n6\n\n87 63 100000037\n\n77 77 100000039\n\n100 200 998244353\n\n200 100 998244353\n\n32 59 998244853\n\n1 1 998244353\n\n```\n\n#### Output #3\n\n```\n26831232\n94573603\n37147649\n847564946\n727060898\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first testcase, there is only one way to generate $a$, and such sequence is a deterministic max-heap, so the answer is $1$.\n\nFor the second testcase, if we choose $v = 1$ and do the operation, we would have $a = [1, 0, 0]$, and since $a_2 = a_3$, we can choose either of them when doing the first $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation, so such heap is not a deterministic max-heap.\n\nAnd if we choose $v = 2$, we would have $a = [1, 1, 0]$, during the first $\\mathrm{pop}$, the following would happen:\n\n- initialize $v$ as $1$\n- since $a_{2v} > a_{2v + 1}$, choose $2v$ as $x$, then $x = 2$\n- assign $a_x$ to $a_v$, then $a = [1, 1, 0]$\n- assign $x$ to $v$, then $v = 2$\n- since $v$ is a leaf, assign $-1$ to $a_v$, then $a = [1, -1, 0]$\n\nSince the first $\\mathrm{pop}$ operation is deterministic, this is a deterministic max-heap. Also, if we choose $v = 3$, $a$ would be a deterministic max-heap, so the answer is $2$.",

For example: $median([2,1,5,4,3]) = 3$, $median([5]) = 5$, and $median([6,8,2,4]) = 4$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the largest median possible after performing the operations.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n4 3\n\n3 9 9 2\n\n5 3\n\n3 2 5 6 4\n\n7 1\n\n5 9 2 6 5 4 6\n\n8 2\n\n7 1 2 6 8 3 4 5\n\n4 5\n\n3 4 5 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n4\n9\n6\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can select a subarray $(l, r)$ which can be either $(1, 3)$ or $(2, 4)$. Thus, two obtainable final arrays are $[3]$ and $[2]$. The former one has the larger median ($3 > 2$) so the answer is $3$.\n\nIn the second test case, three obtainable final arrays are $[6, 4]$, $[3, 4]$, and $[3, 2]$. Their medians are $4$, $3$, and $2$ respectively. The answer is $4$.\n\nIn the third test case, only one element is left in the final array and it can be any element of the initial array. The largest one among them is $9$, so the answer is $9$.",

That is why Sakurakos teacher decided to go on a field trip. It is known that all of the students will be walking in one line. The student with index $i$ has some topic of interest which is described as $a_i$. As a teacher, you want to minimise the disturbance of the line of students.\n\nThe disturbance of the line is defined as the number of neighbouring people with the same topic of interest. In other words, disturbance is the number of indices $j$ ($1 \\le j < n$) such that $a_j = a_{j + 1}$.\n\nIn order to do this, you can choose index $i$ ($1\\le i\\le n$) and swap students at positions $i$ and $n-i+1$. You can perform any number of swaps.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimal amount of disturbance that you can achieve by doing the operation described above any number of times.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by two lines.\n\n- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) -- the length of the line of students.\n- The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1\\le a_i\\le n$) -- the topics of interest of students in line.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimal possible disturbance of the line that you can achieve.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n5\n\n1 1 1 2 3\n\n6\n\n2 1 2 2 1 1\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 1\n\n6\n\n2 1 1 2 2 4\n\n4\n\n2 1 2 3\n\n6\n\n1 2 2 1 2 1\n\n5\n\n4 5 5 1 5\n\n7\n\n1 4 3 5 1 1 3\n\n7\n\n3 1 3 2 2 3 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, it is necessary to apply the operation to $i=2$, thus the array will become $[1, \\textbf{2}, 1, \\textbf{1}, 3]$, with the bold elements indicating those that have swapped places.

This graph encodes a hidden permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ of size $n$. The graph is constructed as follows:\n\n- For every pair of integers $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, an undirected edge is added between vertex $p_i$ and vertex $p_j$ if and only if $p_i < p_j$. Note that the edge is not added between vertices $i$ and $j$, but between the vertices of their respective elements. Refer to the notes section for better understanding.\n\nYour task is to reconstruct and output the permutation $p$. It can be proven that permutation $p$ can be uniquely determined.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains a string of $n$ characters $g_{i, 1}g_{i, 2}\\ldots g_{i, n}$ ($g_{i, j} = \\mathtt{0}$ or $g_{i, j} = \\mathtt{1}$) -- the adjacency matrix. $g_{i, j} = \\mathtt{1}$ if and only if there is an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists a permutation $p$ which generates the given graph. It is also guaranteed that the graph is undirected and has no self-loops, meaning $g_{i, j} = g_{j, i}$ and $g_{i, i} = \\mathtt{0}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ representing the reconstructed permutation.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n00101\n\n00101\n\n11001\n\n00001\n\n11110\n\n6\n\n000000\n\n000000\n\n000000\n\n000000\n\n000000\n\n000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n4 2 1 3 5\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first case $p = [1]$. Since there are no pairs $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, there are no edges in the graph.\n\nThe graph in the second case is shown below. For example, when we choose $i = 3$ and $j = 4$, we add an edge between vertices $p_i = 1$ and $p_j = 3$, because $p_i < p_j$. However, when we choose $i = 2$ and $j = 3$, $p_i = 2$ and $p_j = 1$, so $p_i < p_j$ doesn't hold. Therefore, we don't add an edge between $2$ and $1$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/73c807a602602d5ad6dd697dfea7a886d23aec16.png)\n\nIn the third case, there are no edges in the graph, so there are no pairs of integers $1 \\le i < j \\le n$ such that $p_i < p_j$. Therefore, $p = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$.",

The dimensions of the kayak can be neglected.\n\nGleb is a strong programmer! Initially, his power is $k$. Gleb's power directly affects the movement of his kayak. If his current power is $x$, then with one paddle stroke the kayak moves $x$ meters in the current direction. Gleb can turn around and continue moving in the opposite direction, but such a maneuver is quite challenging, and after each turn, his power decreases by $1$. The power can never become $0$ -- if his current power is $1$, then even after turning it remains $1$. Moreover, Gleb cannot make two turns in a row -- after each turn, he must move at least once before making another turn. Similarly, Gleb cannot make a turn immediately after the start -- he must first perform a paddle stroke.\n\nGleb wants to reach point $s$ from point $0$ without leaving the segment $[0, s]$ and while preserving as much power as possible.

The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $k$ and the sum of $k$.\n\nIn ancient Persia, [Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam), a clever merchant and mathematician, is playing a game with his prized treasure chest containing $n$ red rubies worth $2$ dinars each and $m$ blue sapphires worth $1$ dinar each. He also has a satchel, which starts empty, and $k$ scrolls with pairs $(r_1, b_1), (r_2, b_2), \\ldots, (r_k, b_k)$ that describe special conditions.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3576d678d9cd8a4cfa1efad5eb4bc61b9ecbcf4d.webp)\n\nThe game proceeds for $n + m$ turns as follows:\n\n1. Khayyam draws a gem uniformly at random from the chest.\n2. He removes the gem from the chest and places it in his satchel.\n3. If there exists a scroll $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq k$) such that the chest contains exactly $r_i$ red rubies and $b_i$ blue sapphires, Khayyam receives a royal decree that doubles the value of all the gems in his satchel as a reward for achieving a special configuration.\n\nNote that the value of some gems might be affected by multiple decrees, and in that case the gems' value is doubled multiple times.\n\nDetermine the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the game, modulo $998,244,353$.\n\nFormally, let $M = 998,244,353$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$. Output the integer equal to $p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$. In other words, output such an integer $x$ that $0 \\le x < M$ and $x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $0 \\leq k \\leq 500$) -- the number of red rubies, the number of blue sapphires, and the number of scrolls describing special conditions, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $k$ lines contains two integers $r_i$, $b_i$ ($0 \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $0 \\leq b_i \\leq m$, $1 \\leq r_i + b_i \\leq n+m-1$). It is guaranteed that the pairs $(r_i, b_i)$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $k$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer: the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the process, modulo $998,244,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3 4 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 0\n\n3 3 2\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n3 3 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\n10 4 5\n\n1 0\n\n8 0\n\n6 4\n\n0 2\n\n7 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n10\n499122180\n798595498\n149736666\n414854846\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, at the end of the process, there will always be $3$ red rubies and $4$ blue sapphires. None of the special conditions described in the scrolls are met, so the value of Khayyam's satchel remains unchanged. The total value of the satchel at the end is always $2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 4 = 10$.\n\nIn the second test case, consider the following two cases:\n\n- With probability $1/2$, Khayyam draws a red ruby, and the value of his satchel becomes $2$. Then with probability $1$, he draws a blue sapphire, and the value of his satchel becomes $3$.\n- With probability $1/2$, Khayyam draws a blue sapphire, and the value of his satchel becomes $1$. At this point, the chest contains $r_1 = 1$ red rubies and $b_1 = 0$ blue sapphires, which match the special condition described in a scroll. As a result, the value of the satchel is doubled to $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. Then with probability $1$, he draws a red ruby, and the value of his satchel becomes $4$.\n\nThus, the expected value at the end is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{7}{2}$, which is $499,122,180$ modulo $998,244,353$.",

They decided to play forever in the following way:\n\n- In each match, two players compete while the third spectates.\n\n- To ensure fairness, no player can play three times in a row. The player who plays twice in a row must sit out as a spectator in the next match, which will be played by the other two players. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator will play in the next match, while the loser will spectate.\n\nNow, the players, fully immersed in this infinite loop of matches, have tasked you with solving the following problem:\n\nGiven an integer $k$, determine whether the spectator of the first match can be the spectator in the $k$-th match.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains one integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 10^9$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if the spectator of the first match can be the spectator of the $k$-th match, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n333\n\n1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the spectator of the first match is already a spectator in the $1$st match.\n\nIn the second test case, the spectator of the first match will play in the $2$nd match regardless of the result of the first match.",

Each vertex has a value of $\\mathtt 0$ or $\\mathtt 1$.\n\nLet's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex $1$ is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of $\\mathtt{10}$ and $\\mathtt{01}$ substrings in it.\n\nTake the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of $\\mathtt 1$ while white vertices have a value of $\\mathtt 0$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d9350fda5ff8865950ffe82ce845754501957e88.png)\n\n- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $5$: the formed string is $\\mathtt{10110}$. The number of occurrences of substring $\\mathtt{10}$ is $2$, the number of occurrences of substring $\\mathtt{01}$ is $1$, so the difference is $2 - 1 = 1$.\n- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $6$: the formed string is $\\mathtt{101}$. The number of occurrences of substring $\\mathtt{10}$ is $1$, the number of occurrences of substring $\\mathtt{01}$ is $1$, so the difference is $1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nThe score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.\n\nBut the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as $\\texttt{?}$. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value $\\texttt{?}$ and changes its value to $\\mathtt{0}$ or $\\mathtt{1}$, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value $\\mathtt{?}$ left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.\n\nAssuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 5\\cdot 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $n - 1$ lines each contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$) -- denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nThe last line contains a string $s$ of length $n$. The $i$-th character of $s$ represents the value of vertex $i$. It's guaranteed that $s$ only contains characters $\\mathtt{0}$, $\\mathtt{1}$ and $\\mathtt{?}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the final score of the tree.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 1\n\n0101\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n3 2\n\n2 4\n\n???0\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n?1?01\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n5 3\n\n3 6\n\n?0????\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n11?1?\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n??\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all the values of the vertices have been determined. There are three different paths from the root to a leaf:\n\n- From vertex $1$ to vertex $2$. The string formed by the path is $\\mathtt{01}$, so the weight of the leaf is $0-1=-1$.\n- From vertex $1$ to vertex $3$. The string formed by the path is $\\mathtt{00}$, so the weight of the leaf is $0-0=0$.\n- From vertex $1$ to vertex $4$. The string formed by the path is $\\mathtt{01}$, so the weight of the leaf is $0-1=-1$.\n\nThus, there are two leaves with non-zero weight, so the score of the tree is $2$.\n\nIn the second test case, one of the sequences of optimal choices for the two players can be:\n\n- Iris chooses to change the value of the vertex $3$ to $\\mathtt 1$.\n- Dora chooses to change the value of the vertex $1$ to $\\mathtt 0$.\n- Iris chooses to change the value of the vertex $2$ to $\\mathtt 0$.\n\nThe final tree is as follows:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/e0dfb0666ab640a4b73dd23d5176bbf71153cf68.png)\n\nThe only leaf with non-zero weight is $3$, so the score of the tree is $1$. Note that this may not be the only sequence of optimal choices for Iris and Dora.",

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $t$ and $n$ are bigger. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \"buddha palm\".\n\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\n\n1. The empty sequence $\\varnothing$ is balanced.\n2. If the bracket sequence $A$ is balanced, then $\\mathtt{(}A\\mathtt{)}$ is also balanced.\n3. If the bracket sequences $A$ and $B$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $A B$ is also balanced.\n\nFor example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\", \"(()(()))\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.\n\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $s$, a pair of indices $(i,j)$ ($i<j$) is called a good pair if $s_i$ is '(', $s_j$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $s$. For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, and $(5,6)$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $2n$ brackets contains exactly $n$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $s$ containing $n$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $n$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $n$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $l\\;r$: The sequence $s$ contains a good pair $(l,r)$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $s$ has $3$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $(2,5)$. Out of $5$ balanced bracket sequences with $3$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair $(2,5)$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $n$ turns to guess $s$.\n\nTo find out the content of $s$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of good pairs.\n\nThen, each of the $n$ following lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ representing the $i$-th clue ($1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 2n$).\n\nThe clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n+1$ integers on a separate line:\n\n- The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n- For all $i \\ge 1$, the $i+1$-th integer is the answer after the $i$-th clue, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n3 4\n\n4\n\n1 6\n\n7 8\n\n2 3\n\n4 5\n\n6\n\n2 3\n\n1 6\n\n7 8\n\n9 12\n\n10 11\n\n4 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5 1 1 1\n14 2 2 1 1\n132 42 5 2 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first test case of the example is explained in the problem description.\n\nThe third test case of the example is explained as follows. It can be shown that there are $132$ balanced bracket sequences with $6$ good pairs. The answers after each clue are given as follows:\n\n1. You are given the good pair $(2,3)$. There are $42$ balanced bracket sequences having the good pair $(2,3)$.\n2. You are given the good pair $(1,6)$. There are $5$ balanced bracket sequences having good pairs $(2,3)$, $(1,6)$.\n3. You are given the good pair $(7,8)$. There are $2$ balanced bracket sequences having the three good pairs. The strings are \"(()())()(())\" and \"(()())()()()\", respectively.\n4. You are given the good pair $(9,12)$. There is only one balanced bracket sequence having the four good pairs. The content of $s$ is therefore the only string, which is \"(()())()(())\".\n\nThen, the number of bracket sequences after the fifth and the sixth clue are both $1$ as you already know the content of $s$.",

This time, they want to obtain an array of strings $a$ of length $n$.\n\nInitially, they have an array $c$ of length $n$, filled with blanks, which are denoted by the symbol $*$. Thus, if $n=4$, then initially $c=[*,*,*,*]$.\n\nThe hackers have access to $m$ neural networks, each of which has its own version of the answer to their request -- an array of strings $b_i$ of length $n$.\n\nThe hackers are trying to obtain the array $a$ from the array $c$ using the following operations:\n\n1. Choose a neural network $i$, which will perform the next operation on the array $c$: it will select a randomblank, for example, at position $j$, and replace $c_j$ with $b_{i, j}$.\nFor example, if the first neural network is chosen and $c = [*, \\text{«like»}, *]$, and $b_1 = [\\text{«I»}, \\text{«love»}, \\text{«apples»}]$, then after the operation with the first neural network, $c$ may become either $[\\text{«I»}, \\text{«like»}, *]$ or $[*, \\text{«like»}, \\text{«apples»}]$.\n\n2. Choose position $j$ and replace $c_j$ with a blank.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the way hackers access neural networks, they will only be able to see the modified array $c$ after all operations are completed, so they will have to specify the entire sequence of operations in advance.\n\nHowever, the random behavior of the neural networks may lead to the situation where the desired array is never obtained, or obtaining it requires an excessive number of operations.\n\nTherefore, the hackers are counting on your help in choosing a sequence of operations that will guarantee the acquisition of array $a$ in the minimum number of operations.\n\nMore formally, if there exists a sequence of operations that can guarantee obtaining array $a$ from array $c$, then among all such sequences, find the one with the minimum number of operations, and output the number of operations in it.\n\nIf there is no sequence of operations that transforms array $c$ into array $a$, then output $-1$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 500$) -- the length of the original array $a$ and the number of neural networks, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the array $a$, consisting of $n$ strings $a_i$ ($1 \\le |a_i| \\le 10$), separated by spaces.\n\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain the arrays $b_i$ -- one in each line, consisting of $n$ strings $b_{i, j}$ ($1 \\le |b_{i,j}| \\le 10$), separated by spaces.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|a_i|$ and $|b_{i, j}|$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$, and that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ across all test cases also does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input strings consist only of characters from the Latin alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.\n\nNote that the length of each individual input string does not exceed $10$.\n\n### Output\n\nOutput $t$ numbers -- one number for each test case, each on a separate line.\n\nIf there exists a sequence of operations that guarantees obtaining array $a$ from the $i$-th test case, then the $i$-th number is the number of operations in the minimum such sequence.\n\nOtherwise, for the $i$-th number, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n4\n3 3\nI love apples\nHe likes apples\nI love cats\nThey love dogs\n3 2\nIcy wake up\nwake Icy up\nwake up Icy\n4 3\nc o D E\nc o D s\nc O l S\nc o m E\n4 5\na s k A\nd s D t\nO R i A\na X b Y\nb a k A\nu s k J\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n-1\n6\n8\n```",

In this version, it is guaranteed that $q = 0$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nAn integer grid $A$ with $p$ rows and $q$ columns is called beautiful if:\n\n- All elements of the grid are integers between $0$ and $2^{30}-1$, and\n- For any subgrid, the XOR of the values at the corners is equal to $0$.

Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.\n\nHowever, Monocarp thinks that this problem is too easy. Therefore, he will perform $q$ updates on the grid. In each update, he will choose an unfilled cell and assign an integer to it. Note that these updates are persistent. That is, changes made to the grid will apply when processing future updates.\n\nFor each of the $q + 1$ states of the grid, the initial state and after each of the $q$ queries, determine the number of ways Polycarp can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.

He loves to duel with anyone he meets. To gather all fans who love to play as well, he decided to organize a big Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament and invited $n$ players.\n\nMouf arranged the $n$ players in a line, numbered from $1$ to $n$. They then held $n - 1$ consecutive duels: for each $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$, player $i$ faced player $i + 1$, producing one winner and one loser per match. Afterward, each player reports a value $a_i(0 \\le a_i \\le 1)$:\n\n- $0$ indicating they won no duels;\n- $1$ indicating they won at least one duel.\n\nSince some may lie about their results (e.g., reporting a $1$ instead of a $0$, or vice versa) to influence prize outcomes, Mouf will cancel the tournament if he can prove any report to be false.\n\nGiven the array $a$, determine whether at least one player must be lying.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) -- the number of players in the tournament.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$) -- denoting the report of the $i$-th player.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if there is at least one liar among the players, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower).

The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array $a$ and a matrix $b$ of integers with $n$ rows and $m$ columns, numbered from $1$. The cell in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is $(i, j)$.\n\nThey are looking for the elements of $a$ in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of $a$ (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell $(r, c)$. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at $(r + 1, c + 1)$ and ending in $(n, m)$ (the submatrix can be empty if $r=n$ or $c=m$). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 300$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $l$, $n$, and $m$ ($1 \\le l, n, m \\le 300$) -- the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $l$ integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots a_l$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le \\min(7, n \\cdot m)$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nThe $i$-th of the last $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, b_{i,3}, \\ldots b_{i,m}$ ($1 \\le b_{i,j} \\le \\min(7, n \\cdot m)$) -- representing the $i$-th row of the matrix.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $l$ over all test cases does not exceed $300$.\n\n### Output\n\nYou should output $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the $i$-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3 5\n\n4 5 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 3 2\n\n4 2 5 1\n\n2 4 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nN\nT\nN```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, Tsovak starts by looking for $1$. There is only one occurrence of $1$ at $(1,1)$, so he chooses it. Then Narek needs to look for $2$ in the submatrix of $(2, 2)$, which consists of just the last two elements: $5$ and $2$. He chooses $2$, and then Tsovak loses since the array has ended.\n\nIn the second example, Tsovak needs to choose $1$. There is a $1$ at the cell $(n,m)$, so he chooses that cell. Then, since the submatrix of $(n + 1, m + 1)$ is empty, Narek cannot find $2$, so he loses.",

Please help her find this number.\n\n$^\\dagger$ Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $a_i$, $d_i$, and $k_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le a_i + k_i\\cdot d_i \\le n$, $1 \\le d_i \\le 10$, $0 \\le k_i \\le n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of connected components.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\n1 2 4\n\n2 2 4\n\n100 1\n\n19 2 4\n\n100 3\n\n1 2 5\n\n7 2 6\n\n17 2 31\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n96\n61\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are $n = 10$ points.

If he can collect $m$ flowers without using the operation, output $0$. If it is impossible to collect $m$ flowers despite using the operation, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n9 5\n\n3 5 2 3 3 5 8 1 2\n\n4 6 2 4 6\n\n6 3\n\n1 2 6 8 2 1\n\n5 4 3\n\n5 3\n\n4 3 5 4 3\n\n7 4 5\n\n6 3\n\n8 4 2 1 2 5\n\n6 1 4\n\n5 5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n6 3\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n9 8 7\n\n5 5\n\n7 7 6 7 7\n\n7 7 7 7 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n6\n3\n7\n0\n-1\n-1\n7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, suppose Igor grows a flower of beauty $6$ and places it between the third and the fourth flowers. Then, the garden will look like the following: $[3, 5, 2, 6, 3, 3, 5, 8, 1, 2]$. Then, he can select the second, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth flowers with beauties $[5, 6, 3, 5, 8]$.\n\nIn the third test case, he can grow a flower of beauty $7$ and place it before the first flower. The garden will look like the following: $[7, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3]$. Now, he can choose the first, second, and fourth flowers.\n\nIn the fourth test case, Igor does not need to use the operation, so the answer is $0$.\n\nIn the sixth test case, no matter how Igor performs the operation, he cannot collect $3$ flowers such that the $i$-th flower he collects has a beauty of at least $b_i$, therefore the answer is $-1$.",

However, Reyhaneh is particular and will only accept a k-harmonic set of permutations.\n\nWe define a k-harmonic set of permutations as a set of $k$ pairwise distinct permutations $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ of size $n$ such that for every pair of indices $i$ and $j$ (where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$), the following condition holds:\n\n\n\n$$ p_1[i] + p_2[i] + \\ldots + p_k[i] = p_1[j] + p_2[j] + \\ldots + p_k[j] $$\n\nYour task is to help Rayan by either providing a valid k-harmonic set of permutations for given values of $n$ and $k$ or by determining that such a set does not exist.\n\nWe call a sequence of length $n$ a permutation if it contains every integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$), the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n, k \\leq 10^5$). The sum of $n \\cdot k$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if a k-harmonic set of permutations exists, print YES on the first line. Then, print $k$ lines, each containing a distinct permutation of the integers from $1$ to $n$.\n\nIf no such set exists, print NO on the first line.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\n\nIf multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 3\n\n4 2\n\n5 1\n\n3 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\nYES\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\nNO\nYES\n1 2 3\n3 2 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn example 1, we have $p_1 = [1, 2, 3]$, $p_2 = [2, 3, 1]$, and $p_3 = [3, 1, 2]$. It's easy to see that $p_1[1] + p_2[1] + p_3[1] = p_1[2] + p_2[2] + p_3[2] = p_1[3] + p_2[3] + p_3[3] = 6$.\n\nIn example 2, we have $p_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]$ and $p_2 = [4, 3, 2, 1]$. It's easy to see that $p_1[1] + p_2[1] = p_1[2] + p_2[2] = p_1[3] + p_2[3] = p_1[4] + p_2[4] = 5$.\n\nIn example 3, as there are five distinct elements in $p_1$, it's obvious that the answer is \"No\".",

In other words, update $a_i := a_i - x$ and $a_j := a_j + x$.\n\nNote that the constraints on $x$ ensure that all elements of array $a$ remain between $0$ and $k$ throughout the operations.\n\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to make the array $a$ non-decreasing$^{\\text{∗}}$ using the above operation. If it is possible, find a sequence of at most $3n$ operations that transforms the array into a non-decreasing one.\n\nIt can be proven that if it is possible to make the array non-decreasing using the above operation, there exists a solution that uses at most $3n$ operations.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$ An array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ is said to be non-decreasing if for all $1 \\le i \\le n - 1$, it holds that $a_i \\le a_{i+1}$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, $n$ and $k$ ($4 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le k \\le 10^9$) -- the length of the array $a$ and the required sum for the operation.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le k$) -- the elements of array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $-1$ if it is not possible to make the array non-decreasing using the operation.\n\nOtherwise, output the number of operations $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le 3n$). On each of the next $m$ lines, output three integers $i$, $j$, and $x$ representing an operation where $a_i$ is decreased by $x$ and $a_j$ is increased by $x$.\n\nNote that you are not required to minimize the number of operations. If there are multiple solutions requiring at most $3n$ operations, you may output any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n5 100\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n5 6\n\n1 2 3 5 4\n\n5 7\n\n7 1 5 3 1\n\n10 10\n\n2 5 3 2 7 3 1 8 4 0\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n1\n4 1 1\n-1\n6\n1 8 2\n3 5 2\n5 7 3\n5 9 3\n8 10 5\n2 10 4```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the array is already non-decreasing, so we do not need to perform any operations.\n\nIn the second test case, we can perform an operation with $i=4$, $j=1$, and $x=1$. $a_4$ decreases by $1$ to become $5 - 1 = 4$ while $a_1$ increases by $1$ to become $1 + 1 = 2$. After the operation, the array becomes $[2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$, which is non-decreasing.\n\nNote that there are other ways to make the array non-decreasing, all of which would be considered correct as long as they do not use more than $3 \\cdot n = 15$ operations.\n\nIn the third test case, it is not possible to make the array non-decreasing. This is because there are no distinct pairs of indices $i$ and $j$ where $a_i + a_j = 7$, so no operation can be done on the array.\n\nIn the fourth test case, the array is transformed as follows:\n\n1. $[\\textbf{0}, 5, 3, 2, 7, 3, 1, \\textbf{10}, 4, 0]$\n2. $[0, 5, \\textbf{1}, 2, \\textbf{9}, 3, 1, 10, 4, 0]$\n3. $[0, 5, 1, 2, \\textbf{6}, 3, \\textbf{4}, 10, 4, 0]$\n4. $[0, 5, 1, 2, \\textbf{3}, 3, 4, 10, \\textbf{7}, 0]$\n5. $[0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, \\textbf{5}, 7, \\textbf{5}]$\n6. $[0, \\textbf{1}, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, \\textbf{9}]$",

The journalists' experiment will last for $m$ days. It is known that at midnight before the first day of the experiment, there were $s_j$ lost pieces of luggage in the $j$-th airport. On the $i$-th day, the following occurs:\n\n- In the morning, $2n$ flights take off simultaneously, including $n$ flights of the first type and $n$ flights of the second type.\n- The $j$-th flight of the first type flies from airport $j$ to airport $(((j-2) \\bmod n )+ 1)$ (the previous airport, with the first airport being the last), and it can carry no more than $a_{i,j}$ lost pieces of luggage.\n- The $j$-th flight of the second type flies from airport $j$ to airport $((j \\bmod n) + 1)$ (the next airport, with the last airport being the first), and it can carry no more than $c_{i,j}$ lost pieces of luggage.\n- In the afternoon, a check of lost luggage is conducted at the airports. If after the flights have departed on that day, there are $x$ pieces of luggage remaining in the $j$-th airport and $x \\ge b_{i, j}$, then at least $x - b_{i, j}$ pieces of luggage are found, and they cease to be lost.\n- In the evening, all $2n$ flights conclude, and the lost luggage transported that day arrives at the corresponding airports.\n\nFor each $k$ from $1$ to $m$, the journalists want to know the maximum number of lost pieces of luggage that may be unfound during the checks over the first $k$ days. Note that for each $k$, these values are calculated independently.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \\le n \\le 12$, $1 \\le m \\le 2000$) -- the number of airports and the number of days of the experiment.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ ($0 \\le s_i \\le 10^8$) -- the initial number of lost pieces of luggage in each airport.\n\nNext, the descriptions for each of the $m$ days follow in order.\n\nThe first line of the description of the $i$-th day contains $n$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,n}$ ($0 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 10^8$) -- the maximum number of lost pieces of luggage that can be transported to the previous airport for each airport.\n\nThe second line of the description of the $i$-th day contains $n$ integers $b_{i,1}, \\ldots, b_{i,n}$ ($0 \\le b_{i, j} \\le 10^8$) -- the minimum number of lost pieces of luggage that will be found on the $i$-th day in each airport.\n\nThe third line of the description of the $i$-th day contains $n$ integers $c_{i,1}, \\ldots, c_{i,n}$ ($0 \\le c_{i, j} \\le 10^8$) -- the maximum number of lost pieces of luggage that can be transported to the next airport for each airport.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $m$ integers -- the maximum number of unfound pieces of luggage for each number of days from $1$ to $m$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n5 3\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n0 0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0 1\n\n1 0 0 1 0\n\n0 1 0 0 0\n\n9 0 9 9 9\n\n0 1 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n9 0 9 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n3 1\n\n0 100000000 5\n\n0 100000000 5\n\n0 100000000 5\n\n0 100000000 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n4\n2\n100000005\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n- On the first day, all $5$ pieces of luggage may not be found, as the lost luggage can be sent on flights from each airport.\n- In the morning of the second day, there may be no more than $3$ pieces of luggage in the $2$-nd airport, no more than $2$ pieces in the $5$-th airport, and no luggage in the other airports. All luggage from the $5$-th airport may remain there. In the $2$-nd airport, no more than $2$ pieces of luggage can be sent on flights to neighboring airports. Thus, at least $1$ piece of luggage will be found.\n- By the end of the third day, lost luggage may only be in the $1$-st and $2$-nd airports. There can be no more than one piece in each, meaning that at most $2$ pieces of luggage will remain unfound in total.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75b781e883fa683f8e14854d82606ce873c13b96.png)The found luggage is marked in green.\n\nIn the second test case, all pieces of luggage may remain in their original airports, and the inspection won't find any lost suitcases. Therefore, the answer is $10^9 + 5$.",

He wants to test Goblin's intelligence, but he has gotten bored of his standard test. So, he decided to make it a bit harder.\n\nFirst, he creates a binary string$^{\\text{∗}}$ $s$ having $n$ characters. Then, he creates $n$ binary strings $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. It is known that $a_i$ is created by first copying $s$, then flipping the $i$-th character ($\\texttt{1}$ becomes $\\texttt{0}$ and vice versa). After creating all $n$ strings, he arranges them into an $n \\times n$ grid $g$ where $g_{i, j} = a_{i_j}$.\n\nA set $S$ of size $k$ containing distinct integer pairs $\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_k, y_k)\\}$ is considered good if:\n\n- $1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$.\n- $g_{x_i, y_i} = \\texttt{0}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$.\n- For any two integers $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\leq i, j \\leq k$), coordinate $(x_i, y_i)$ is reachable from coordinate $(x_j, y_j)$ by traveling through a sequence of adjacent cells (which share a side) that all have a value of $\\texttt{0}$.\n\nGoblin's task is to find the maximum possible size of a good set $S$. Because Dr. TC is generous, this time he gave him two seconds to find the answer instead of one.

The game uses a deck of $2n$ cards with different values.\n2. The deck is evenly split between the player and the dealer: each receives $n$ cards.\n3. Over $n$ rounds, the player and the dealer simultaneously play one top card from their hand. The cards are compared, and the point goes to the one whose card has a higher value. The winning card is removed from the game, while the losing card is returned to the hand and placed on top of the other cards in the hand of the player who played it.\n\nNote that the game always lasts exactly $n$ rounds.\n\nYou have tracked the shuffling of the cards and know the order of the cards in the dealer's hand (from top to bottom). You want to maximize your score, so you can swap any two cards in your hand no more than once (to avoid raising suspicion).\n\nDetermine the maximum number of points you can achieve.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The gameplay will be organized as follows:\n\n1. The cards with values $5$ and $2$ are compared. The player wins and receives a point.\n2. The cards with values $6$ and $2$ are compared.

Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{5}$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_{i} \\le n$) -- the original permutation. All $p_i$ are distinct.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$ ($1 \\le d_{i} \\le n$). All $d_{i}$ are distinct.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input:\n\n- the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^{5}$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing $n$ integers, where the $i$-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to fix the array which was obtained after the $i$-th query (i.e., the permutation $p$ where all integers $p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, \\dots, p_{d_i}$ are replaced by zeroes).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n3 2 1\n\n5\n\n4 5 3 1 2\n\n4 5 1 3 2\n\n7\n\n4 3 1 2 7 5 6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 3\n2 4 4 5 5\n4 4 4 4 7 7 7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, after each query, every integer which was replaced by $0$ can be restored by one operation.\n\nIn the second test case, you can act as follows:\n\n- Query $1$: $p = [4, 5, 3, 0, 2]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, 5, 3, {\\color{red}4}, 2]$.\n- Query $2$: $p = [4, 5, 3, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, 3, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $3$: $p = [0, 5, 3, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, 3, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $4$: $p = [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, {\\color{red}3}, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $5$: $p = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, {\\color{red}3}, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n\nThe numbers that were changed are highlighted in red.",

The following are the descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le m \\le 10^5$) -- the number of intersections and streets in the city.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains three integers $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$ ($1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < t_0 \\le 10^9$) -- the start time of the event, the start time of the phone call, and its end time, respectively.\n\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain descriptions of the streets.\n\nThe $i$-th line contains four integers $u_i$, $v_i$, $l_{i1}$, $l_{i2}$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$, $1 \\le l_{i1} < l_{i2} \\le 10^9$) -- the numbers of the intersections connected by the $i$-th street, as well as the travel time along the street by bus and on foot. It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of intersections and that it is possible to reach any intersection from any other.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of the values of $m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the latest time you can leave home to have time to talk on the phone and not be late for the event. If you cannot reach the event on time, output -1.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n5 5\n\n100 20 80\n\n1 5 30 100\n\n1 2 20 50\n\n2 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n4 5 20 50\n\n2 1\n\n100 50 60\n\n1 2 55 110\n\n4 4\n\n100 40 60\n\n1 2 30 100\n\n2 4 30 100\n\n1 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n3 3\n\n100 80 90\n\n1 2 1 10\n\n2 3 10 50\n\n1 3 20 21\n\n3 2\n\n58 55 57\n\n2 1 1 3\n\n2 3 3 4\n\n2 1\n\n12 9 10\n\n2 1 6 10\n\n5 5\n\n8 5 6\n\n2 1 1 8\n\n2 3 4 8\n\n4 2 2 4\n\n5 3 3 4\n\n4 5 2 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n-1\n60\n80\n53\n3\n2\n```",

It is a directed graph, in which each vertex has exactly one outgoing arc. The graph is given as the array $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$, where $g_i$ means that there is an arc that goes from $i$ to $g_i$. For some vertices, the outgoing arcs might be self-loops.\n\nInitially, all vertices of the graph are colored in color $1$. You can perform the following operation: select a vertex and a color from $1$ to $k$, and then color this vertex and all vertices that are reachable from it. You can perform this operation any number of times (even zero).\n\nYou should process $q$ queries. The query is described by three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$. For each query, you should:\n\n- assign $g_x := y$;\n- then calculate the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$ (two colorings are different if there exists at least one vertex that is colored in different colors in these two colorings); since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $3$.\n\nNote that in every query, the initial coloring of the graph is reset (all vertices initially have color $1$ in each query).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$ ($1 \\le g_i \\le n$).\n\nThe $q$ lines follow.

The only local minimum in $[3, 2, 1]$ is $1$. Hence, elements $3$ and $2$ are removed. There is only one remaining element; hence the process terminates.\n\nThis satisfies array $a = [1, 1, -1]$ as both $p_1$ and $p_2$ were removed on iteration number $1$, while $p_3$ was not removed.\n\nIn the second test case, operations will be applied to permutation $p = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$ as follows:\n\n1. The local minima in $[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$ are $3$ and $1$. Hence, elements $4$, $5$, and $2$ are removed.\n2. The only local maximum in $[3, 1]$ is $3$. Hence, element $1$ is removed. There is only one remaining element; hence the process terminates.\n\nThis satisfies array $a = [1, -1, 1, 2, 1]$ as elements $p_1 = 4$, $p_3 = 5$, and $p_5 = 2$ were removed on iteration $1$, element $p_4 = 1$ was removed on iteration $2$, and element $p_2 = 3$ was not removed.\n\nIn the third test case, operations will be applied on permutation $[6, 7, 2, 4, 3, 8, 5, 1]$ as follows:\n\n1. The local minima in $[6, 7, 2, 4, 3, 8, 5, 1]$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, and $1$. Hence, elements $7$, $4$, $8$, and $5$ are removed.\n2. The local maxima in $[6, 2, 3, 1]$ are $6$ and $3$. Hence, elements $2$ and $1$ are removed.\n3. The only local minimum in $[6, 3]$ is $3$. Hence, element $6$ is removed. There is only one remaining element; hence the process terminates.\n\nIn the fourth test case, one permutation satisfying the constraints is \\[$6$, $5$, $2$, $1$, $3$, $4$, $7$\\]. $1$ is the only local minimum, so only it will stay after the first iteration. Note that there are other valid permutations; for example, \\[$6$, $4$, $3$, $1$, $2$, $5$, $7$\\] would also be considered correct.",

Dora considers the mural as the matrix $b$ of size $n \\times n$. Initially, $b_{i,j} = 0$ for all $1 \\le i, j \\le n$.\n\nDora has only two brushes which have two different colors. In one operation, she can paint the matrix with one of two brushes:\n\n- The first brush has color $1$ on it and can paint one column of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $1 \\leq j \\leq n$ and makes $b_{i,j} := 1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$;\n- The second brush has color $2$ on it and can paint one row of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and makes $b_{i,j} := 2$ for all $1 \\leq j \\leq n$.\n\nDora paints the matrix so that the resulting matrix $b$ contains only $1$ and $2$.\n\nFor a matrix $b$, let $f(b)$ denote the minimum number of operations needed to turn the initial matrix (containing only $0$) into $b$. The beauty of a matrix $b$ is the number of ways to paint the initial matrix in exactly $f(b)$ operations to turn it into $b$. If there's no way to turn the initial matrix into $b$, the beauty of $b$ is $0$.\n\nHowever, Dora made a uniformly random mistake; there's exactly one element different in the matrix $a$ given to you from the real matrix $b$. That is, there is exactly one pair $(i, j)$ such that $a_{i, j} = 3 - b_{i, j}$.\n\nPlease help Dora compute the expected beauty of the real matrix $b$ modulo $998\\,244\\,353$ (all possible $n^2$ mistakes have equal probability).\n\nSince the size of the matrix is too large, Dora will only tell you the positions of $m$ elements of color $1$, and the remaining $n^2-m$ elements have color $2$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(10^6, n^2)$) -- the size of the matrix and the number of elements of color $1$.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow, each containing two positive integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$) -- denoting that $a_{x_i, y_i} = 1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if $i \\neq j$, then $(x_i, y_i) \\neq (x_j, y_j)$.\n\nIt is also guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $4\\cdot10^5$, and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the expected beauty of the real matrix $b$, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n2 2\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 1\n\n3 2\n\n1 1\n\n3 3\n\n6 0\n\n5 10\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 1\n\n2 3\n\n5 1\n\n5 2\n\n5 3\n\n5 4\n\n5 5\n\n3 5\n\n1 1\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\n3 3\n\n4 3\n\n1 1\n\n2 3\n\n2 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n499122178\n665496236\n120\n79859554\n776412275\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the matrix $a = \\left[\\begin{matrix}1&1\\\\2&2\\end{matrix}\\right]$. Let's consider changing the element $(1,1)$ to calculate the answer.\n\nIt can be proved that the minimum steps to paint the initial matrix into $\\left[\\begin{matrix}2&1\\\\2&2\\end{matrix}\\right]$ is $3$. We can first paint the first row into color $2$, then paint the second column into color $1$, and finally paint the second row into color $2$. The process is listed below:\n\n\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{matrix}0&0\\\\0&0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\Rightarrow\\left[\\begin{matrix}2&2\\\\0&0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\Rightarrow\\left[\\begin{matrix}2&1\\\\0&1\\end{matrix}\\right]\\Rightarrow\\left[\\begin{matrix}2&1\\\\2&2\\end{matrix}\\right]$$\n\nIt can be proved that this is the only way to paint the matrix in $3$ steps. So the beauty of the matrix $\\left[\\begin{matrix}2&1\\\\2&2\\end{matrix}\\right]$ is $1$. Similarly, if any other element of the matrix is changed, the beauty is always $1$, so the expected beauty of the real matrix $b$ is $1$.\n\nIn the second test case, the matrix $a = \\left[\\begin{matrix}1&2\\\\2&2\\end{matrix}\\right]$. Let's consider changing the element $(2, 2)$ to calculate the answer.\n\nIt can be proven that it's impossible to paint the initial matrix into $\\left[\\begin{matrix}1&2\\\\2&1\\end{matrix}\\right]$, so its beauty is $0$. If any other element of the matrix is changed, the beauty is always $2$, so the expected beauty is $\\frac{0 + 2 + 2 + 2}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} \\equiv 499\\,122\\,178 \\pmod {998\\,244\\,353}$.",

As a reward, she received a permutation $p$. Kosuke was not entirely satisfied because he failed one exam and did not receive a gift. He decided to sneak into her room (thanks to the code for her lock) and spoil the permutation so that it becomes simple.\n\nA permutation $p$ is considered simple if for every $i$ $(1\\le i \\le n)$ one of the following conditions holds:\n\n- $p_i=i$\n- $p_{p_i}=i$\n\nFor example, the permutations $[1, 2, 3, 4]$, $[5, 2, 4, 3, 1]$, and $[2, 1]$ are simple, while $[2, 3, 1]$ and $[5, 2, 1, 4, 3]$ are not.\n\nIn one operation, Kosuke can choose indices $i,j$ $(1\\le i,j\\le n)$ and swap the elements $p_i$ and $p_j$.\n\nSakurako is about to return home. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by two lines.\n\n- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1\\le n \\le 10^6$) -- the length of the permutation $p$.\n- The second line contains $n$ integers $p_i$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$) -- the elements of the permutation $p$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $p$ is a permutation.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n5\n\n2 3 4 5 1\n\n4\n\n2 3 4 1\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n7\n\n2 3 1 5 6 7 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n0\n2\n1\n0\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first and second examples, the permutations are already simple.\n\nIn the fourth example, it is sufficient to swap $p_2$ and $p_4$.

Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. Each vertex has an integer from $1$ to $n$ written on it. Each value from $1$ to $n$ is written on exactly two different vertices. Each vertex also has a cost --vertex $i$ costs $2^i$.\n\nYou need to choose a subset of vertices of the tree such that:\n\n- the subset is connected; that is, from each vertex in the subset, you can reach every other vertex in the subset by passing only through the vertices in the subset;\n- each value from $1$ to $n$ is written on at least one vertex in the subset.\n\nAmong all such subsets, you need to find the one with the smallest total cost of the vertices in it. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of vertices in the subset.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2n}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$). Each value from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly twice.\n\nEach of the next $2n-1$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \\le v, u \\le 2n$) -- the edges of the tree. These edges form a valid tree.\n\n### Output\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer $k$ -- the number of vertices in the subset.\n\nIn the second line, print $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $2n$ -- the indices of the vertices in the chosen subset.

Only one monkey may sit in each seat, and each monkey's preference must be followed if it is seated.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of monkeys that Ball can seat?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains four integers $m$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($1 \\leq m, a, b, c \\leq 10^8$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of monkeys you can seat.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n10 5 5 10\n\n3 6 1 1\n\n15 14 12 4\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n420 6 9 69\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n20\n5\n30\n2\n84\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the second test case, $6$ monkeys want to sit in the front row, but only $3$ seats are available. The monkeys that have no preference and the monkeys who prefer sitting in the second row can sit in the second row together. Thus, the answer is $3+2=5$.",

In other words, there does not exist a pair of indices $(i, j)$ ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$) such that the $i$-th teddy bear is pink, and the $j$-th teddy bear is black.\n\nYou want to reorder the teddy bears into a beautiful arrangement. You are too short to reach the shelf, but luckily, you can send instructions to a robot to move the teddy bears around.

But Harshith likes to mess with Aryan. Harshith gives Aryan three rectangles of sizes $l_1\\times b_1$, $l_2\\times b_2$, and $l_3\\times b_3$ such that $l_3\\leq l_2\\leq l_1$ and $b_3\\leq b_2\\leq b_1$. Aryan, in order to defeat Harshith, decides to arrange these three rectangles to form a square such that no two rectangles overlap and the rectangles are aligned along edges. Rotating rectangles is not allowed. Help Aryan determine if he can defeat Harshith.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Such operation can be performed only if after the operation, $1 \\le i \\le n$ holds.\n\nYour task is to construct any permutation $p$ of length $n$, such that the minimum number of carriage return operations needed to make $a = p$ is the same no matter which typewriter Misuki is using.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

It can be proven that, for both typewriters, it is impossible to write $p$ with $0$ carriage returns.\n\nWith the first typewriter it is possible to:\n\n- Move pointer: move the pointer to the next position.

In this version, $\\mathbf{u = v}$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a fun game on a tree. This game is played on a tree with $n$ vertices, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Recall that a tree with $n$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $n - 1$ edges.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. Each player starts at some vertex.\n\nOn their turn, a player must move from the current vertex to a neighboring vertex that has not yet been visited by anyone. The first player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nYou are given two vertices $u$ and $v$. Represent the simple path from vertex $u$ to $v$ as an array $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_m$, where $p_1 = u$, $p_m = v$, and there is an edge between $p_i$ and $p_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ ($1 \\le i < m$).\n\nYou need to determine the winner of the game if Alice starts at vertex $1$ and Bob starts at vertex $p_j$ for each $j$ (where $1 \\le j \\le m$).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nEach of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le n$), denoting an undirected edge between vertices $a$ and $b$.

Print \"Alice\" (without quotes) if Alice wins, or \"Bob\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 3\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n4 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nBob\nAlice\nAlice\n```\n\n### Note\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/70e2519179e33349716846c2c5f4c4b2ac3f9c21.png)Tree from the first and second examples.\n\nIn the first test case, the path will be ($2,2$).
