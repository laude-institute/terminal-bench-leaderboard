    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2101A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given $n^2$ cards with values from $0$ to $n^2-1$. You are to arrange them in a $n$ by $n$ grid such that there is exactly one card in each cell.\n\nThe MEX (minimum excluded value) of a subgrid$^{\\text{∗}}$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the subgrid.\n\nYour task is to arrange the cards such that the sum of MEX values over all $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$ subgrids is maximized.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A subgrid of a $n$ by $n$ grid is specified by four numbers $l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2$ satisfying $1\\le l_1\\le r_1\\le n$ and $1\\le l_2\\le r_2\\le n$. The element in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column of the grid is part of the subgrid if and only if $l_1\\le i\\le r_1$ and $l_2\\le j\\le r_2$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 500$) -- the side length of the grid.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ lines, each containing $n$ integers representing the elements of the grid.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 1\n2 3\n8 4 5\n6 0 1\n7 2 3```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, one valid arrangement is:\n\n0123\n\nThere are $9$ subgrids in total, and the $4$ of them with non-zero MEX are shown below:\n\n0values:$[0]$ -- MEX: $1$\n\n01values:$[0, 1]$  -- MEX: $2$\n\n02values:$[0, 2]$  -- MEX: $1$\n\n0123values:$[0, 1, 2, 3]$  -- MEX: $4$\n\nThe sum of MEX over all subgrids would be $1+2+1+4 = 8$. It can be proven that no other arrangements have a larger sum of MEX values.",
