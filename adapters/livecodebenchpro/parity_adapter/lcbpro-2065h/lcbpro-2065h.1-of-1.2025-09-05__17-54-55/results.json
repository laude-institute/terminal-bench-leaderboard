    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2065H)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSkibidus thinks he's Him! He proved it by solving this difficult task. Can you also prove yourself?\n\nGiven a binary string$^{\\text{∗}}$ $t$, $f(t)$ is defined as the minimum number of contiguous substrings, each consisting of identical characters, into which $t$ can be partitioned. For example, $f(\\texttt{00110001}) = 4$ because $t$ can be partitioned as $\\texttt{[00][11][000][1]}$ where each bracketed segment consists of identical characters.\n\nSkibidus gives you a binary string $s$ and $q$ queries. In each query, a single character of the string is flipped (i.e. $\\texttt{0}$ changes to $\\texttt{1}$ and $\\texttt{1}$ changes to $\\texttt{0}$); changes are saved after the query is processed. After each query, output the sum over all $f(b)$ where $b$ is a non-empty subsequence$^{\\text{†}}$ of $s$, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A binary string consists of only characters $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A subsequence of a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ ($1 \\leq |s| \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe following line of each test case contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of queries.\n\nThe following line contains $q$ integers $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_q$ ($1 \\leq v_i \\leq |s|$), denoting $s_{v_i}$ is flipped for the $i$'th query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $q$ integers on a single line -- the answer after each query modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n101\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n10110\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n101110101\n\n5\n\n7 2 4 4 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n10 7\n61 59 67\n1495 1169 1417 1169 1396\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $s$ becomes $\\texttt{001}$ after the first query. Let's calculate the answer for each subsequence:\n\n- $f(s_1) = f(\\texttt{0}) = 1$\n- $f(s_2) = f(\\texttt{0}) = 1$\n- $f(s_3) = f(\\texttt{1}) = 1$\n- $f(s_1 s_2) = f(\\texttt{00}) = 1$\n- $f(s_1 s_3) = f(\\texttt{01}) = 2$\n- $f(s_2 s_3) = f(\\texttt{01}) = 2$\n- $f(s_1 s_2 s_3) = f(\\texttt{001}) = 2$\n\nThe sum of these values is $10$, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.",
