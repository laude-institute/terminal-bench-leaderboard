    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2065C2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. In this version, $m \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\nSkibidus has obtained two arrays $a$ and $b$, containing $n$ and $m$ elements respectively. For each integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$, he is allowed to perform the operation at most once:\n\n- Choose an integer $j$ such that $1 \\leq j \\leq m$. Set $a_i := b_j - a_i$. Note that $a_i$ may become non-positive as a result of this operation.\n\nSkibidus needs your help determining whether he can sort $a$ in non-decreasing order$^{\\text{∗}}$ by performing the above operation some number of times.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$a$ is sorted in non-decreasing order if $a\\_1 \\\\leq a\\_2 \\\\leq \\\\ldots \\\\leq a\\_n$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe following line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nThe following line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if it is possible to sort $a$ in non-decreasing order, print \"YES\" on a new line. Otherwise, print \"NO\" on a new line.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will also be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 3\n\n5\n\n9 1 1000000000\n\n3 2\n\n1 4 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 4 6 5\n\n6 1 8\n\n5 2\n\n6 4 5 4 5\n\n4 1000\n\n3 1\n\n9 8 7\n\n8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $[5]$ is already sorted.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible.\n\nIn the third test case, we can set $a_2:=b_1-a_2=6-4=2$ and $a_3:=b_3-a_3=8-6=2$. The sequence $[2,2,2,5]$ is in nondecreasing order.\n\nIn the last case, we can apply operations on each index. The sequence becomes $[-1,0,1]$, which is in nondecreasing order.",
