    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2117F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYousef has a rooted tree$^{\\text{∗}}$ consisting of exactly $n$ vertices, which is rooted at vertex $1$. You would like to give Yousef an array $a$ of length $n$, where each $a_i$ $(1 \\le i \\le n)$ can either be $1$ or $2$.\n\nLet $s_u$ denote the sum of $a_v$ where vertex $v$ is in the subtree$^{\\text{†}}$ of vertex $u$. Yousef considers the tree special if all the values in $s$ are pairwise distinct (i.e., all subtree sums are unique).\n\nYour task is to help Yousef count the number of different arrays $a$ that result in the tree being special. Two arrays $b$ and $c$ are different if there exists an index $i$ such that $b_i \\neq c_i$.\n\nAs the result can be very large, you should print it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A tree is a connected undirected graph with $n - 1$ edges.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$The subtree of a vertex $v$ is the set of all vertices that pass through $v$ on a simple path to the root. Note that vertex $v$ is also included in the set.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ $(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$ -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of several lines. The first line of the test case contains an integer $n$ $(2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $n−1$ lines follow, each of them contains two integers $u$ and $v$ $(1 \\le u,v \\le n, u \\ne v)$ which describe a pair of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and has no loops or multiple edges.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer $x$ -- the number of different arrays $a$ that result in the tree being special, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 8\n\n2 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 6\n\n6 7\n\n10\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 6\n\n4 7\n\n7 8\n\n4 9\n\n9 10\n\n7\n\n1 4\n\n4 2\n\n3 2\n\n3 5\n\n2 6\n\n6 7\n\n7\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n3 5\n\n4 6\n\n6 7\n\n7\n\n5 7\n\n4 6\n\n1 6\n\n1 3\n\n2 6\n\n6 7\n\n5\n\n3 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n24\n0\n16\n48\n0\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe tree given in the fifth test case:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/bd9f04ef8898b0b29a6e5e86a17295ed03a19d03.png)",
