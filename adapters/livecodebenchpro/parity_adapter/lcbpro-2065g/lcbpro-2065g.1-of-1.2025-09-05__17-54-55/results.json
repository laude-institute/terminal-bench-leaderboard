Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2065G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSkibidus was abducted by aliens of Amog! Skibidus tries to talk his way out, but the Amog aliens don't believe him. To prove that he is not totally capping, the Amog aliens asked him to solve this task:\n\nAn integer $x$ is considered a semi-prime if it can be written as $p \\cdot q$ where $p$ and $q$ are (not necessarily distinct) [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number). For example, $9$ is a semi-prime since it can be written as $3 \\cdot 3$, and $3$ is a prime number.\n\nSkibidus was given an array $a$ containing $n$ integers. He must report the number of pairs $(i, j)$ such that $i \\\\leq j$ and $\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a\\_i, a\\_j)$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$ is semi-prime.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$Given two integers $x$ and $y$, $\\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$ denotes the [least common multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) of $x$ and $y$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe following line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($2 \\leq a_i \\leq n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of ordered pairs of indices on a new line.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2 2 3 4\n\n6\n\n2 2 3 4 5 6\n\n9\n\n2 2 4 5 7 8 9 3 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n12\n18\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the $5$ pairs of indices are $(1, 3)$, $(1, 4)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$, and $(4, 4)$.",
