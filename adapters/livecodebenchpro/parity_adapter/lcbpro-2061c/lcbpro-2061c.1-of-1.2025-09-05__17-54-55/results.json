    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2061C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKevin enjoys logic puzzles.\n\nHe played a game with $n$ classmates who stand in a line. The $i$-th person from the left says that there are $a_i$ liars to their left (not including themselves).\n\nEach classmate is either honest or a liar, with the restriction that no two liars can stand next to each other. Honest classmates always say the truth. Liars can say either the truth or lies, meaning their statements are considered unreliable.\n\nKevin wants to determine the number of distinct possible game configurations modulo $998\\,244\\,353$. Two configurations are considered different if at least one classmate is honest in one configuration and a liar in the other.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1\\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of classmates.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0\\leq a_i \\leq n$) -- the number of liars to the left of the $i$-th person they claimed.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer -- the number of distinct game configurations modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n3\n\n0 1 2\n\n5\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n5\n\n0 0 1 1 2\n\n5\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n5\n\n0 0 1 1 1\n\n5\n\n5 1 5 2 5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n0\n4\n1\n2\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nWe will use $\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$ to mark liars and $\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}$ to mark honest people.\n\nIn the first test case, the only possible way is $(\\color{red}{0},\\color{blue}{1},\\color{red}{2})$.\n\nIn the second test case, two possible ways are $(\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0})$ and $(\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{red}{0})$.\n\nIn the third test case, three possible ways are $(\\color{blue}{0},\\color{blue}{0},\\color{red}{1},\\color{blue}{1},\\color{red}{2})$, $(\\color{blue}{0},\\color{red}{0},\\color{blue}{1},\\color{red}{1},\\color{blue}{2})$, $(\\color{blue}{0},\\color{red}{0},\\color{blue}{1},\\color{blue}{1},\\color{red}{2})$.",
