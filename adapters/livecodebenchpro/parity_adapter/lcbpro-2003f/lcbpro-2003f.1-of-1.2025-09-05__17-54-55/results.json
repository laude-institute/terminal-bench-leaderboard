    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2003F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nPiggy gives Turtle three sequences $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$, and $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$.\n\nTurtle will choose a subsequence of $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ of length $m$, let it be $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- $a_{p_1} \\le a_{p_2} \\le \\cdots \\le a_{p_m}$;\n- All $b_{p_i}$ for all indices $i$ are pairwise distinct, i.e., there don't exist two different indices $i$, $j$ such that $b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}$.\n\nHelp him find the maximum value of $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $m$ that satisfies the conditions above.\n\nRecall that a sequence $a$ is a subsequence of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3000$, $1 \\le m \\le 5$) -- the lengths of the three sequences and the required length of the subsequence.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the elements of the sequence $a$.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the elements of the sequence $b$.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le 10^4$) -- the elements of the sequence $c$.\n\n### Output\n\nOutput a single integer -- the maximum value of $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$. If it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $m$ that satisfies the conditions above, output $-1$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4 2\n\n2 3 4 2\n\n1 3 3 2\n\n1 4 2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n7 3\n\n1 4 5 2 3 6 7\n\n1 2 2 1 1 3 2\n\n1 5 6 7 3 2 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n13\n```\n\n#### Input #3\n\n```\n\n5 3\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n1 1 2 1 2\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #3\n\n```\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, we can choose $p = [1, 2]$, then $c_{p_1} + c_{p_2} = 1 + 4 = 5$. We can't choose $p = [2, 4]$ since $a_2 > a_4$, violating the first condition. We can't choose $p = [2, 3]$ either since $b_2 = b_3$, violating the second condition. We can choose $p = [1, 4]$, but $c_1 + c_4 = 4$, which isn't maximum.\n\nIn the second example, we can choose $p = [4, 6, 7]$.\n\nIn the third example, it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $3$ that satisfies both of the conditions.",
