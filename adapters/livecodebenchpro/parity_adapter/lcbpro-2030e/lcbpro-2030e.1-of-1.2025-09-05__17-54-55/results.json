    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2030E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSuppose we partition the elements of an array $b$ into any number $k$ of non-empty multisets $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k$, where $k$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Define the score of $b$ as the maximum value of $\\\\operatorname{MEX}(S\\_1)\n\n$$^{\\text{∗}}$$\n\noperatorname{MEX}(S\\_2) + \\\\ldots + \\\\operatorname{MEX}(S\\_k)$ over all possible partitions of $b$ for any integer $k$.\n\nEnvy is given an array $a$ of size $n$. Since he knows that calculating the score of $a$ is too easy for you, he instead asks you to calculate the sum of scores of all $2^n - 1$ non-empty subsequences of $a$.$^{\\text{†}}$ Since this answer may be large, please output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$ of a collection of integers $c\\_1, c\\_2, \\\\ldots, c\\_k$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ that does not occur in the collection $c$. For example, $\\\\operatorname{MEX}(\\[0,1,2,2\\]) = 3$ and $\\\\operatorname{MEX}(\\[1,2,2\\]) = 0$\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A sequence $x$ is a subsequence of a sequence $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by deleting several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\leq a_i < n$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the answer, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0 0 1\n\n4\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n5\n\n0 0 1 2 2\n\n4\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n11\n26\n53\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first testcase, we must consider seven subsequences:\n\n- $[0]$: The score is $1$.\n- $[0]$: The score is $1$.\n- $[1]$: The score is $0$.\n- $[0,0]$: The score is $2$.\n- $[0,1]$: The score is $2$.\n- $[0,1]$: The score is $2$.\n- $[0,0,1]$: The score is $3$.\n\nThe answer for the first testcase is $1+1+2+2+2+3=11$.\n\nIn the last testcase, all subsequences have a score of $0$.",
