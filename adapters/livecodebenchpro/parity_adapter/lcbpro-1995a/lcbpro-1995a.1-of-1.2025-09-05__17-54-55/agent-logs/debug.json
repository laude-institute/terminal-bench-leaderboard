He realized that all these $k$ chips need to be placed on the cells of the board (no more than one chip can be placed on a single cell).\n\nLet's denote the cell in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column as $(i ,j)$. A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value $i + j$ is the same. For example, cells $(3, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(1, 3)$ lie on the same diagonal, but $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$ do not. A diagonal is called occupied if it contains at least one chip.\n\nDetermine what is the minimum possible number of occupied diagonals among all placements of $k$ chips.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$)\u00a0-- the number of sets of input data.

In the second test case, both chips can be placed on diagonal $(2, 1), (1, 2)$, so the answer is 1. In the third test case, 3 chips can't be placed on one diagonal, but placing them on $(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)$ makes 2 diagonals occupied.
