    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2103A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. An array $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m$ is beautiful if there exists an array $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m$ such that the elements of $y$ are distinct (in other words, $y_i\\neq y_j$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le m$), and the product of $x_i$ and $y_i$ is the same for all $1 \\le i \\le m$ (in other words, $x_i\\cdot y_i = x_j\\cdot y_j$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le m$).\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum size of a subsequence$^{\\text{∗}}$ of array $a$ that is beautiful.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A sequence $b$ is a subsequence of a sequence $a$ if $b$ can be obtained from $a$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) -- the length of the array $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the elements of array $a$.\n\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum size of a subsequence of array $a$ that is beautiful.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n5\n\n3 1 4 1 5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n4\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the entire array $a = [1, 2, 3]$ is already beautiful. A possible array $y$ is $[6, 3, 2]$, which is valid since the elements of $y$ are distinct, and $1\\cdot 6 = 2\\cdot 3 = 3\\cdot 2$.\n\nIn the second test case, the subsequence $[3, 1, 4, 5]$ is beautiful. A possible array $y$ is $[20, 60, 15, 12]$. It can be proven that the entire array $a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]$ is not beautiful, so the maximum size of a subsequence of array $a$ that is beautiful is $4$.",
