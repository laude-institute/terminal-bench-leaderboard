    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1993D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nGiven two positive integers $n$ and $k$, and another array $a$ of $n$ integers.\n\nIn one operation, you can select any subarray of size $k$ of $a$, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let $(l, r)$ be an operation on subarray $a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$ such that $r-l+1=k$, then performing this operation means replacing $a$ with $[a_1, \\ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, \\ldots, a_n]$.\n\nFor example, if $a=[1,2,3,4,5]$ and we perform operation $(3,5)$ on this array, it will become $a=[1,2]$. Moreover, operation $(2, 4)$ results in $a=[1,5]$, and operation $(1,3)$ results in $a=[4,5]$.\n\nYou have to repeat the operation while the length of $a$ is greater than $k$ (which means $|a| \\gt k$). What is the largest possible median$^\\dagger$ of all remaining elements of the array $a$ after the process?\n\n$^\\dagger$The median of an array of length $n$ is the element whose index is $\\left \\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\right \\rfloor$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $median([2,1,5,4,3]) = 3$, $median([5]) = 5$, and $median([6,8,2,4]) = 4$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the largest median possible after performing the operations.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n4 3\n\n3 9 9 2\n\n5 3\n\n3 2 5 6 4\n\n7 1\n\n5 9 2 6 5 4 6\n\n8 2\n\n7 1 2 6 8 3 4 5\n\n4 5\n\n3 4 5 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n4\n9\n6\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can select a subarray $(l, r)$ which can be either $(1, 3)$ or $(2, 4)$. Thus, two obtainable final arrays are $[3]$ and $[2]$. The former one has the larger median ($3 > 2$) so the answer is $3$.\n\nIn the second test case, three obtainable final arrays are $[6, 4]$, $[3, 4]$, and $[3, 2]$. Their medians are $4$, $3$, and $2$ respectively. The answer is $4$.\n\nIn the third test case, only one element is left in the final array and it can be any element of the initial array. The largest one among them is $9$, so the answer is $9$.",
