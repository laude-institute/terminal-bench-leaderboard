    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2026C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere is a shop that sells action figures near Monocarp's house. A new set of action figures will be released shortly; this set contains $n$ figures, the $i$-th figure costs $i$ coins and is available for purchase from day $i$ to day $n$.\n\nFor each of the $n$ days, Monocarp knows whether he can visit the shop.\n\nEvery time Monocarp visits the shop, he can buy any number of action figures which are sold in the shop (of course, he cannot buy an action figure that is not yet available for purchase). If Monocarp buys at least two figures during the same day, he gets a discount equal to the cost of the most expensive figure he buys (in other words, he gets the most expensive of the figures he buys for free).\n\nMonocarp wants to buy exactly one $1$-st figure, one $2$-nd figure, ..., one $n$-th figure from the set. He cannot buy the same figure twice. What is the minimum amount of money he has to spend?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n- the first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of figures in the set (and the number of days);\n- the second line contains a string $s$ ($|s| = n$, each $s_i$ is either 0 or 1). If Monocarp can visit the shop on the $i$-th day, then $s_i$ is 1; otherwise, $s_i$ is 0.\n\nAdditional constraints on the input:\n\n- in each test case, $s_n$ is 1, so Monocarp is always able to buy all figures during the $n$-th day;\n- the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the minimum amount of money Monocarp has to spend.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n101101\n\n7\n\n1110001\n\n5\n\n11111\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n8\n18\n6\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Monocarp buys the $1$-st figure on the $1$-st day and spends $1$ coin.\n\nIn the second test case, Monocarp can buy the $1$-st and the $3$-rd figure on the $3$-rd day, the $2$-nd and the $4$-th figure on the $4$-th day, and the $5$-th and the $6$-th figure on the $6$-th day. Then, he will spend $1+2+5=8$ coins.\n\nIn the third test case, Monocarp can buy the $2$-nd and the $3$-rd figure on the $3$-rd day, and all other figures on the $7$-th day. Then, he will spend $1+2+4+5+6 = 18$ coins.",
