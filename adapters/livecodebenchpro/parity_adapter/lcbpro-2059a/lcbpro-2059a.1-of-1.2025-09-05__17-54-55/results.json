    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2059A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAn array is called good if for any element $x$ that appears in this array, it holds that $x$ appears at least twice in this array. For example, the arrays $[1, 2, 1, 1, 2]$, $[3, 3]$, and $[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4]$ are good, while the arrays $[1]$, $[1, 2, 1]$, and $[2, 3, 4, 4]$ are not good.\n\nMilya has two good arrays $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. She can rearrange the elements in array $a$ in any way. After that, she obtains an array $c$ of length $n$, where $c_i = a_i + b_i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$).\n\nDetermine whether Milya can rearrange the elements in array $a$ such that there are at least $3$ distinct elements in array $c$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 50$) -- the length of the arrays $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $b$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $«$YES$»$ (without quotes) if it is possible to obtain at least $3$ distinct elements in array $c$, and $«$NO$»$ otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (for example, $«$YES$»$, $«$Yes$»$, $«$yes$»$, $«$yEs$»$ will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n1 2 1 2\n\n6\n\n1 2 3 3 2 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n6\n\n1 52 52 3 1 3\n\n59 4 3 59 3 4\n\n4\n\n100 1 100 1\n\n2 2 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can swap the second and third elements. Then the array $a = [1, 1, 2, 2]$, $b = [1, 2, 1, 2]$, and then $c = [2, 3, 3, 4]$.\n\nIn the second test case, you can leave the elements unchanged. Then $c = [2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2]$.\n\nIn the third test case, the array $a$ will not change from rearranging the elements in it. Then $c = [2, 2, 2]$, so the answer is $«$NO$»$.",
