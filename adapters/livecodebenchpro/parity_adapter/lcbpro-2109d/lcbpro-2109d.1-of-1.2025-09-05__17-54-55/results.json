    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2109D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOf course, a problem with the letter D is sponsored by Declan Akaba.\n\nYou are given a simple, connected, undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges. You are also given a multiset $A$ consisting of $\\\\ell$ elements:\n\n$$ A = \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_\\ell\\} $$\n\nStarting from vertex $1$, you may perform the following move any number of times, as long as the multiset $A$ is not empty:\n\n- Select an element $k \\in A$ and remove it from the multiset . You must remove exactly one occurrence of $k$ from $A$.\n- Traverse any walk$^{\\text{∗}}$ of exactly $k$ edges to reach some vertex (possibly the same one you started from).\n\nFor each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$), determine whether there exists a sequence of such moves that starts at vertex $1$ and ends at vertex $i$, using the original multiset $A$.\n\nNote that the check for each vertex $i$ is independent -- you restart from vertex $1$ and use the original multiset $A$ for each case.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A walk of length $k$ is a sequence of vertices $v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_{k - 1}, v_k$ such that each consecutive pair of vertices $(v_i, v_{i + 1})$ is connected by an edge in the graph. The sequence may include repeated vertices.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $\\ell$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n-1 \\leq m \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the size of the multiset, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $\\ell$ integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{\\ell}$ ($1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^4$) -- the elements of the multiset.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u < v \\le n$) -- the endpoints of an edge in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the edges form a simple, connected graph without self-loops or multiple edges.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$, the sum of $m$, and the sum of $\\ell$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$, $4 \\cdot 10^5$, and $2 \\cdot 10^5$, respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length $n$, where the $i$-th character is $\\mathtt{1}$ if there exists a sequence of moves ending at vertex $i$, and $\\mathtt{0}$ otherwise.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n6 5 2\n\n2 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 6\n\n5 5 1\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n3 5\n\n5 4 3\n\n100 200 300\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n2 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n111101\n11111\n10001\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n- Vertex $1$ is reachable without making any moves.\n- Vertex $2$ is reachable by selecting element $3 \\in A$; one possible walk is \\[$1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2$\\].\n- Vertex $3$ can be reached by selecting element $2 \\in A$ and taking the walk \\[$1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$\\].\n- Vertex $4$ is reachable by selecting element $3 \\in A$ and following the walk \\[$1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4$\\].\n- Vertex $5$ is not reachable by any valid sequence of moves.\n- Vertex $6$ is reachable by first selecting element $2 \\in A$ and taking the walk \\[$1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$\\], followed by selecting element $3 \\in A$ and taking the walk \\[$3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6$\\].",
