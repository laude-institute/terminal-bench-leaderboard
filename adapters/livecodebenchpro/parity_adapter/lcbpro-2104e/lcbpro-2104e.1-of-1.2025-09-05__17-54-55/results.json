    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2104E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nLet's call a letter allowed if it is a lowercase letter and is one of the first $k$ letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of allowed letters.\n\nLet's call a string $t$ pleasant if $t$ is a subsequence of $s$.\n\nYou are given $q$ strings $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_q$. All of them consist only of allowed letters. For each string $t_i$, calculate the minimum number of allowed letters you need to append to it on the right so that it stops being pleasant.\n\nA sequence $t$ is a subsequence of a sequence $s$ if $t$ can be obtained from $s$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$; $1 \\le k \\le 26$) -- the length of the string $s$ and the number of allowed letters.\n\nThe second line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters. Each character of the string is one of the first $k$ letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe third line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of queries.\n\nThe next $q$ lines contain queries: one query per line. The $i$-th line contains the string $t_i$, consisting only of allowed letters.\n\nAdditional constraint on input: the total length of all $t_i$ does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, output one integer -- the minimum number of allowed letters that need to be appended to the string on the right so that it stops being pleasant.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7 3\n\nabacaba\n\n3\n\ncc\n\nbcb\n\nb\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n5 1\n\naaaaa\n\n6\n\na\n\naa\n\naaa\n\naaaa\n\naaaaa\n\naaaaaa\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example:\n\n1. The string cc is already unpleasant, so nothing needs to be appended to it;\n2. bcb is pleasant, so at least one letter needs to be appended to the right: bcba will not work, but bcbb and bcbc are unpleasant.\n3. To b, at least two letters need to be appended, since ba, bb, and bc are pleasant. For example, we can obtain an unpleasant string bbb.",
