    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2096G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nYou are a proud teacher at the Millennium Science School. Today, a student named Alice challenges you to a guessing game.\n\nAlice is thinking of an integer from $1$ to $n$, and you must guess it by asking her some queries.\n\nTo make things harder, she says you must ask all the queries first, and she will ignore exactly $1$ query.\n\nFor each query, you choose an array of $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$, where $k$ is even. Then, Alice will respond with one of the following:\n\n- $\\texttt{L}$: the number is one of the first $\\frac{k}{2}$ elements of the array;\n- $\\texttt{R}$: the number is one of the last $\\frac{k}{2}$ elements of the array;\n- $\\texttt{N}$: the number is not in the array;\n- $\\texttt{?}$: this query is ignored.\n\nAlice is impatient, so you must find a strategy that minimizes the number of queries. Can you do it?\n\nFormally, let $f(n)$ be the minimum number of queries required to determine Alice's number. Then you must find a strategy that uses exactly $f(n)$ queries.\n\nNote that the interactor is adaptive, which means Alice's number is not fixed at the beginning and may depend on your queries. However, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one number that is consistent with Alice's responses.\n\nWe can show that $f(n) \\leq 20$ for all $n$ such that $2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the maximum possible value of Alice's number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Interaction\n\nThe interaction begins by reading the integer $n$.\n\nThen, output a single integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 20$) -- the number of queries.\n\nTo ask a query, output a line in the following format:\n\n- $k\\,a_1\\,a_2 \\ldots a_k$ ($2 \\leq k \\leq n$, $k$ is even, $1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$, the $a_i$ are distinct) -- the length of the array, and the array itself.\n\nOnce you've asked all $q$ queries, read a string $s$ ($|s| = q$) -- the responses to the queries as described above.\n\nWhen you know Alice's number, output a single integer $x$ ($1 \\leq x \\leq n$) -- the value of the number.\n\nThen, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there are no more test cases.\n\nAfter outputting all $q$ queries, do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n- System.out.flush() in Java;\n- flush(output) in Pascal;\n- stdout.flush() in Python;\n- See the documentation for other languages.\n\nNote that even if you correctly determine Alice's number but use more than $f(n)$ queries, you will get Wrong answer.\n\nFor this problem, hacks are disabled.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n2\n3\n\n?N\n\n5\n\nR?L\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n\n2\n2 1 2\n2 1 2\n\n3\n\n3\n4 3 2 4 1\n4 5 4 3 1\n4 1 5 3 4\n\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $n = 3$. We ask $2$ queries: $[1, 2]$, and $[1, 2]$ again.\n\n- For the first query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{?}$, which means this query is ignored.\n- For the second query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{N}$, which means her number is not in the array $[1, 2]$.\n\nFrom the information above, we can determine that Alice's number is $3$.\n\nIt can be shown that all valid strategies for $n = 3$ require at least $2$ queries.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 5$. We ask $3$ queries: $[3, 2, 4, 1]$, $[5, 4, 3, 1]$, and $[1, 5, 3, 4]$.\n\n- For the first query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{R}$, which means her number is in the array $[4, 1]$.\n- For the second query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{?}$, which means this query is ignored.\n- For the third query, Alice's response is $\\texttt{L}$, which means her number is in the array $[1, 5]$.\n\nFrom the information above, we can determine that Alice's number is $1$.\n\nIt can be shown that all valid strategies for $n = 5$ require at least $3$ queries.",
