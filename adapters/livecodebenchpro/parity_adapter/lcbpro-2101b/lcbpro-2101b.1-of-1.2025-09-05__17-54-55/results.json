    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2101B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a permutation $a$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- Choose an index $1\\le i\\le n - 3$. Then, swap $a_i$ with $a_{i + 2}$, and $a_{i + 1}$ with $a_{i + 3}$ simultaneously. In other words, permutation $a$ will be transformed from $[\\ldots, a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, \\ldots]$ to $[\\ldots, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots]$.\n\nDetermine the lexicographically smallest permutation$^{\\text{†}}$ that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$An array $x$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $y$ of the same size if and only if the following holds:\n\n- in the first position where $x$ and $y$ differ, the array $x$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $y$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($4\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of permutation $a$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the elements of permutation $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3 4 1 2\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 1 2\n\n10\n\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 3 4 5\n2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 10 9\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, an operation can be done on index $i = 1$, and the permutation will become $[1, 2, 3, 4]$, which is the lexicographically smallest permutation achievable.\n\nIn the second test case, we can do the following sequence of operations:\n\n- Do an operation on index $i = 2$. The permutation becomes $[5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$.\n- Do an operation on index $i = 1$. The permutation becomes $[2, 4, 5, 1, 3]$.\n- Do an operation on index $i = 2$. The permutation becomes $[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]$.",
