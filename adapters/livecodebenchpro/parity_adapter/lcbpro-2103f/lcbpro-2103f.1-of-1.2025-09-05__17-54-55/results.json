    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2103F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThe bitwise nor$^{\\text{∗}}$ of an array of $k$-bit integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ can be computed by calculating the bitwise nor cumulatively from left to right. More formally, $\\operatorname{nor}(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m) = \\operatorname{nor}(\\operatorname{nor}(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{m - 1}), b_m)$ for $m\\ge 2$, and $\\operatorname{nor}(b_1) = b_1$.\n\nYou are given an array of $k$-bit integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. For each index $i$ ($1\\le i\\le n$), find the maximum bitwise nor among all subarrays$^{\\text{†}}$ of $a$ containing index $i$. In other words, for each index $i$, find the maximum value of $\\operatorname{nor}(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r)$ among all $1 \\le l \\le i \\le r \\le n$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$ The [logical nor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_NOR) of two boolean values is $1$ if both values are $0$, and $0$ otherwise. The bitwise nor of two $k$-bit integers is calculated by performing the logical nor operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.\n\nFor example, let us compute $\\operatorname{nor}(2, 6)$ when they are represented as $4$-bit numbers. In binary, $2$=$0010_2$ and $6=0110_2$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{nor}(2,6) = 1001_2 = 9$ as by performing the logical nor operations from left to right, we have:\n\n- $\\operatorname{nor}(0,0) = 1$\n- $\\operatorname{nor}(0,1) = 0$\n- $\\operatorname{nor}(1,0) = 0$\n- $\\operatorname{nor}(1,1) = 0$\n\nNote that if $2$ and $6$ were represented as $3$-bit integers instead, then $\\operatorname{nor}(2,6) = 1$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$An array $x$ is a subarray of an array $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le k \\le 17$) -- the number of elements in the array and the number of bits of the array elements.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 2^k - 1$) -- the elements of array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers, the $i$-th of which is the maximum bitwise nor among all subarrays of $a$ containing index $i$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n5 3\n\n1 7 4 6 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 3\n5 7 5 6 5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, subarrays that have index $1$ are $[1]$ and $[1, 3]$. The values of their bitwise nor are $1$ and $0$ respectively. Hence, the answer for index $1$ is $1$. Subarrays that have index $2$ are $[3]$ and $[1, 3]$. The values of their bitwise nor are $3$ and $0$ respectively. Hence, the answer for index $2$ is $3$.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n- For $i = 1$, the subarray with maximum bitwise nor is $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5] = [1, 7, 4, 6, 2]$, $\\operatorname{nor}(1, 7, 4, 6, 2) = 5$\n- For $i = 2$, the subarray with maximum bitwise nor is $[a_2] = [7]$, $\\operatorname{nor}(7) = 7$\n- For $i = 3$, the subarray with maximum bitwise nor is $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5] = [1, 7, 4, 6, 2]$, $\\operatorname{nor}(1, 7, 4, 6, 2) = 5$\n- For $i = 4$, the subarray with maximum bitwise nor is $[a_4] = [6]$, $\\operatorname{nor}(6) = 6$\n- For $i = 5$, the subarray with maximum bitwise nor is $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5] = [1, 7, 4, 6, 2]$, $\\operatorname{nor}(1, 7, 4, 6, 2) = 5$",
