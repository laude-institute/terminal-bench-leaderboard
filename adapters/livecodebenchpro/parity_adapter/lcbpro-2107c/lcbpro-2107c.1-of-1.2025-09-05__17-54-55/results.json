    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2107C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ of length $n$ and a positive integer $k$, but some parts of the array $a$ are missing. Your task is to fill the missing part so that the maximum subarray sum$^{\\text{∗}}$ of $a$ is exactly $k$, or report that no solution exists.\n\nFormally, you are given a binary string $s$ and a partially filled array $a$, where:\n\n- If you remember the value of $a_i$, $s_i = 1$ to indicate that, and you are given the real value of $a_i$.\n- If you don't remember the value of $a_i$, $s_i = 0$ to indicate that, and you are given $a_i = 0$.\n\nAll the values that you remember satisfy $|a_i| \\le 10^6$. However, you may use values up to $10^{18}$ to fill in the values that you do not remember. It can be proven that if a solution exists, a solution also exists satisfying $|a_i| \\le 10^{18}$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The maximum subarray sum of an array $a$ of length $n$, i.e. $a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$ is defined as $\\max_{1 \\le i \\le j \\le n} S(i, j)$ where $S(i, j) = a_i + a_{i + 1} + \\ldots + a_j$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two numbers $n,k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5,1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary ($\\texttt{01}$) string $s$ of length $n$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($|a_i| \\le 10^6$). If $s_i = \\texttt{0}$, then it's guaranteed that $a_i = 0$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, first output $\\texttt{Yes}$ if a solution exists or $\\texttt{No}$ if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example $\\texttt{YES}$ and $\\texttt{yEs}$ will also be accepted.\n\nIf there's at least one solution, print $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ on the second line. $|a_i| \\le 10^{18}$ must hold.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n10\n\n3 5\n\n011\n\n0 0 1\n\n5 6\n\n11011\n\n4 -3 0 -2 1\n\n4 4\n\n0011\n\n0 0 -4 -5\n\n6 12\n\n110111\n\n1 2 0 5 -1 9\n\n5 19\n\n00000\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n5 19\n\n11001\n\n-8 6 0 0 -5\n\n5 10\n\n10101\n\n10 0 10 0 10\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3 5\n\n111\n\n3 -1 3\n\n4 5\n\n1011\n\n-2 0 1 -5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYes\n4 0 1\nYes\n4 -3 5 -2 1\nYes\n2 2 -4 -5\nNo\nYes\n5 1 9 2 2\nYes\n-8 6 6 7 -5\nYes\n10 -20 10 -20 10\nNo\nYes\n3 -1 3\nYes\n-2 4 1 -5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn test case $1$, only the first position is not filled. We can fill it with $4$ to get the array $[4, 0, 1]$ which has maximum subarray sum of $5$.\n\nIn test case $2$, only the third position is not filled. We can fill it with $5$ to get the array $[4, -3, 5, -2, 1]$. Here the maximum subarray sum comes from the subarray $[4, -3, 5]$ and it is $6$, as required.\n\nIn test case $3$, the first and second positions are unfilled. We can fill both with $2$ to get the array $[2, 2, -4, -5]$ which has a maximum subarray sum of $4$. Note that other outputs are also possible such as $[0, 4, -4, -5]$.\n\nIn test case $4$, it is impossible to get a valid array. For example, if we filled the third position with $0$, we get $[1, 2, 0, 5, -1, 9]$, but this has a maximum subarray sum of $16$, not $12$ as required.",
