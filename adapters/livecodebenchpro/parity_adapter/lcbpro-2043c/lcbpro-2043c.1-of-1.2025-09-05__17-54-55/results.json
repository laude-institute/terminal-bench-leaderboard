    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2043C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers, where all elements except for at most one are equal to $-1$ or $1$. The remaining element $x$ satisfies $-10^9 \\le x \\le 10^9$.\n\nFind all possible sums of subarrays of $a$, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as $0$. In other words, find all integers $x$ such that the array $a$ has at least one subarray (possibly empty) with sum equal to $x$. A subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array.\n\nOutput these sums in ascending order. Each sum should be printed only once, even if it is achieved by multiple subarrays.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. Then, $t$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the size of the array.\n- The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $a$. In the array $a$, there is at most one element that is neither $1$ nor $-1$.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output two lines:\n\n- In the first line, print a single integer -- the number of distinct subarray sums.\n- In the second line, print these sums in ascending order.\n\nEach sum should be printed only once, even if it is produced by multiple subarrays.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n5\n\n1 -1 10 1 1\n\n5\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n2\n\n-1 2\n\n2\n\n7 1\n\n3\n\n1 4 -1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n8\n-1 0 1 2 9 10 11 12\n6\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n4\n-1 0 1 2\n4\n0 1 7 8\n6\n-1 0 1 3 4 5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's define $a[i,j]$ as the subarray of $a$ from position $i$ to position $j$.\n\nConsider the first test case of the example:\n\n- $-1$ is produced by $a[2,2]$;\n- $0$ is produced by the empty subarray;\n- $1$ is produced by $a[4,4]$;\n- $2$ is produced by $a[4,5]$;\n- $9$ is produced by $a[2,3]$;\n- $10$ is produced by $a[1,3]$;\n- $11$ is produced by $a[3,4]$;\n- $12$ is produced by $a[3,5]$.",
