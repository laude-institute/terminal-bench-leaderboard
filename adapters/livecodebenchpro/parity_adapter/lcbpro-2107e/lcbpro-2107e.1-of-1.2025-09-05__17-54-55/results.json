    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2107E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIf I was also hit by an apple falling from an apple tree, could I become as good at physics as Newton?\n\nTo be better at physics, Ain wants to build an apple tree so that she can get hit by apples on it. Her apple tree has $n$ nodes and is rooted at $1$. She defines the weight of an apple tree as $\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n \\sum \\limits_{j=i+1}^n \\text{dep}(\\operatorname{lca}(i,j))$.\n\nHere, $\\text{dep}(x)$ is defined as the number of edges on the unique shortest path from node $1$ to node $x$. $\\operatorname{lca}(i, j)$ is defined as the unique node $x$ with the largest value of $\\text{dep}(x)$ and which is present on both the paths $(1, i)$ and $(1, j)$.\n\nFrom some old books Ain reads, she knows that Newton's apple tree's weight is around $k$, but the exact value of it is lost.\n\nAs Ain's friend, you want to build an apple tree with $n$ nodes for her, and the absolute difference between your tree's weight and $k$ should be at most $1$, i.e. $|\\text{weight} - k| \\le 1$. Unfortunately, this is not always possible, in this case please report it.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two numbers $n,k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5,0 \\le k \\le 10^{15}$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, first output $\\texttt{Yes}$ if a solution exists or $\\texttt{No}$ if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example $\\texttt{YES}$ and $\\texttt{yEs}$ will also be accepted.\n\nIf there's at least one solution, print $n-1$ lines and each line contains two numbers $u,v$ $(1 \\le u,v \\le n)$ represents the apple tree.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2 1\n\n2 2\n\n4 0\n\n5 7\n\n5 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYes\n1 2\nNo\nYes\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nYes\n1 3\n3 5\n4 5\n3 2\nYes\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, we can check that the weight is $0$. This satisfies the condition because $k = 1$ and so the absolute difference is only $1$.\n\nIn the second test case, there exists no solution because there are no trees of $2$ nodes with weights of either $1, 2$ or $3$.",
