    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2036D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOne morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that $1543$ is the most favorite number in his life.\n\nThe first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $n$ by $m$ cells; $n$ and $m$ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $0$ to $9$.\n\nPolycarp became curious about how many times the number $1543$ would appear in all layers$^{\\text{∗}}$ of the carpet when traversed clockwise.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The first layer of a carpet of size $n \\times m$ is defined as a closed strip of length $2 \\cdot (n+m-2)$ and thickness of $1$ element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^3$, $n, m$ -- even integers).\n\nThis is followed by $n$ lines of length $m$, consisting of digits from $0$ to $9$ -- the description of the carpet.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single number -- the total number of times $1543$ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2 4\n\n1543\n\n7777\n\n2 4\n\n7154\n\n8903\n\n2 4\n\n3451\n\n8888\n\n2 2\n\n54\n\n13\n\n2 2\n\n51\n\n43\n\n2 6\n\n432015\n\n512034\n\n4 4\n\n5431\n\n1435\n\n5518\n\n7634\n\n6 4\n\n5432\n\n1152\n\n4542\n\n2432\n\n2302\n\n5942\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n2\n2\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/376751b0f30c54602e78b686b24d2749f7484632.png)Occurrences of $1543$ in the seventh example.
