You are an AI assistant that generates shell commands to solve competitive programming tasks in a Docker container.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.

Instruction:
LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
  - PID: problem id (default 2074C)
  - LANG: language (default cpp)
  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

This time, the pink soldiers have given you an integer $x$ ($x \ge 2$).

Please determine if there exists a positive integer $y$ that satisfies the following conditions.

- $y$ is strictly less than $x$.
- There exists a non-degenerate triangle$^{\text{∗}}$ with side lengths $x$, $y$, $x \oplus y$. Here, $\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Additionally, if there exists such an integer $y$, output any.

$^{\text{∗}}$A triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$ is non-degenerate when $a+b > c$, $a+c > b$, $b+c > a$.

### Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2000$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$).

### Output

For each test case, print one integer on a separate line. The integer you must output is as follows:

- If there exists an integer $y$ satisfying the conditions, output the value of $y$ ($1 \le y < x$);
- Otherwise, output $-1$.

If there exist multiple integers that satisfy the conditions, you may output any.

### Example

#### Input #1

```

7

5

2

6

3

69

4

420

```

#### Output #1

```
3
-1
5
-1
66
-1
320
```

### Note

In the first test case, there exists a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths $3$, $5$, and $3 \oplus 5 = 6$. Therefore, $y=3$ is a valid answer.

In the second test case, $1$ is the only possible candidate for $y$, but it cannot make a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the answer is $-1$.

Generate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.

For competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:
1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp
2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout
3. Handle multiple test cases if specified
4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures

Return your response in JSON format with two fields:

1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute
2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do

Example response format:

{
    "commands": ["cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    // solution code\n    return 0;\n}\nEOF"],
    "explanation": "Create C++ solution file"
}
