    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2091B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAt the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\", there are training sessions in competitive programming -- both individual and team-based!\n\nFor the next team training session, $n$ students will attend, and the skill of the $i$-th student is given by a positive integer $a_i$.\n\nThe coach considers a team strong if its strength is at least $x$. The strength of a team is calculated as the number of team members multiplied by the minimum skill among the team members.\n\nFor example, if a team consists of $4$ members with skills $[5, 3, 6, 8]$, then the team's strength is $4 \\cdot min([5, 3, 6, 8]) = 12$.\n\nOutput the maximum possible number of strong teams, given that each team must have at least one participant and every participant must belong to exactly one team.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$) -- the number of students in training and the minimum strength of a team to be considered strong.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) -- the skill of each student.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible number of teams with strength at least $x$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n6 4\n\n4 5 3 3 2 6\n\n4 10\n\n4 2 1 3\n\n5 3\n\n5 3 2 3 2\n\n3 6\n\n9 1 7\n\n6 10\n\n6 1 3 6 3 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n0\n4\n2\n1\n```",
