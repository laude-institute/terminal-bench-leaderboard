    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2077A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\n[Breach of Faith - Supire feat.eili](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVTiCKIIQSM)\n\nYou and your team have worked tirelessly until you have a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2n+1}$ of positive integers satisfying these properties.\n\n- $1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}$ for all $1 \\le i \\le 2n + 1$.\n- $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2n+1}$ are pairwise distinct.\n- $a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + \\ldots + a_{2n} - a_{2n+1}$.\n\nHowever, the people you worked with sabotaged you because they wanted to publish this sequence first. They deleted one number from this sequence and shuffled the rest, leaving you with a sequence $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{2n}$. You have forgotten the sequence $a$ and want to find a way to recover it.\n\nIf there are many possible sequences, you can output any of them. It can be proven under the constraints of the problem that at least one sequence $a$ exists.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $2n$ distinct integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{2n}$ ($1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$), denoting the sequence $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $2n+1$ distinct integers, denoting the sequence $a$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{18}$).\n\nIf there are multiple possible sequences, you can output any of them. The sequence $a$ should satisfy the given conditions, and it should be possible to obtain $b$ after deleting one element from $a$ and shuffling the remaining elements.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n9 2\n\n2\n\n8 6 1 4\n\n3\n\n99 2 86 33 14 77\n\n2\n\n1 6 3 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n7 9 2\n1 8 4 6 9\n86 99 2 77 69 14 33\n4 6 1 2 3\n```",
