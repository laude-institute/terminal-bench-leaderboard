    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2066C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. Also, you are given three variables $P,Q,R$, initially equal to zero.\n\nYou need to process all the numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, in the order from $1$ to $n$. When processing the next $a_i$, you must perform exactly one of the three actions of your choice:\n\n1. $P := P \\oplus a_i$\n2. $Q := Q \\oplus a_i$\n3. $R := R \\oplus a_i$\n\n$\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nWhen performing actions, you must follow the main rule: it is necessary that after each action, all three numbers $P,Q,R$ are not pairwise distinct.\n\nThere are a total of $3^n$ ways to perform all $n$ actions. How many of them do not violate the main rule? Since the answer can be quite large, find it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the array $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the number of ways to perform all $n$ actions without violating the main rule, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3\n\n1 7 9\n\n4\n\n179 1 1 179\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 3 2\n\n12\n\n8 2 5 3 9 1 8 12 9 9 9 4\n\n1\n\n1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n9\n39\n123\n3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are 3 valid sequences of operations: PPP, QQQ, RRR.\n\nIn the second test case, there are 9 valid sequences of operations: PPPP, PPPQ, PPPR, QQQP, QQQQ, QQQR, RRRP, RRRQ, RRRR.",
