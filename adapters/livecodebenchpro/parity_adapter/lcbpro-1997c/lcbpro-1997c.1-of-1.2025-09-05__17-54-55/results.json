    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1997C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMonocarp had a regular bracket sequence $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is even). He even came up with his own way to calculate its cost.\n\nHe knows that in a regular bracket sequence (RBS), each opening bracket is paired up with the corresponding closing bracket. So he decided to calculate the cost of RBS as the sum of distances between pairs of corresponding bracket pairs.\n\nFor example, let's look at RBS (())(). It has three pairs of brackets:\n\n- (\\_\\_)\\_\\_: the distance between brackets at position $1$ and at $4$ is $4 - 1 = 3$;\n- \\_()\\_\\_\\_: the distance is $3 - 2 = 1$;\n- \\_\\_\\_\\_(): the distance is $6 - 5 = 1$.\n\nSo the cost of (())() is $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nUnfortunately, due to data corruption, Monocarp lost all characters on odd positions $s_1, s_3, \\dots, s_{n-1}$. Only characters on even positions ($s_2, s_4, \\dots, s_{n}$) remain. For example, (())() turned to \\_(\\_)\\_).\n\nMonocarp wants to restore his RBS by placing brackets on the odd positions. But since the restored RBS may not be unique, he wants to choose one with minimum cost. It's too hard to do for Monocarp alone, so can you help him?\n\nReminder: A regular bracket sequence is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted 1-s and +-s, gives a valid mathematical expression. For example, (), (()) or (()())() are RBS, while ), ()( or ())(() are not.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) -- the number of test cases. Next $t$ cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $n$ is even) -- the length of string $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, where all characters on the odd positions are '\\_' and all characters on the even positions are either '(' or ')'.\n\nAdditional constraints:\n\n- $s$ can be restored to at least one regular bracket sequence;\n- the total sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print one integer -- the minimum cost of the regular bracket sequence that can be obtained from $s$ by replacing '\\_'-s with brackets.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\\_(\\_)\\_)\n\n2\n\n\\_)\n\n8\n\n\\_)\\_)\\_)\\_)\n\n8\n\n\\_(\\_)\\_(\\_)\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n4\n8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it's optimal to make $s$ equal to (())(). The cost of $s$ will be equal to $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nIn the second test case, the only option is to make $s$ equal to () with cost $1$.\n\nIn the third test case, the only possible RBS is ()()()() with cost $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it's optimal to make $s$ equal to (())(()) with cost $3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8$.",
