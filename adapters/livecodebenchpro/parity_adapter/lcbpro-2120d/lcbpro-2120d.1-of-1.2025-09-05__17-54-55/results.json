    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2120D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers $a$, $b$, and $k$. Aryan then gives Harshith two integers $n$ and $m$. Harshith then gives Aryan a matrix $X$ with $n$ rows and $m$ columns, such that each of the elements of $X$ is between $1$ and $k$(inclusive). After that, Aryan wins if he can find a submatrix$^{\\text{∗}}$ $Y$ of $X$ with $a$ rows and $b$ columns such that all elements of $Y$ are equal.\n\nFor example, when $a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3$ and $m=3$, if Harshith gives Aryan the matrix below, it is a win for Aryan as it has a submatrix of size $2\\times 2$ with all elements equal to $1$ as shown below.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/69d24173a1df27d03c8b9991eba30c6d7e1b139e.png) Example of a matrix where Aryan wins\n\nAryan gives you the values of $a$, $b$, and $k$. He asks you to find the lexicographically minimum tuple $(n,m)$ that he should give to Harshith such that Aryan always wins. Help Aryan win the game. Assume that Harshith plays optimally. The values of $n$ and $m$ can be large, so output them modulo $10^9+7$. A tuple $(n_1, m_1)$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than $(n_2, m_2)$ if either $n_1<n_2$ or $n_1=n_2$ and $m_1<m_2$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by removing some rows and/or columns from the original matrix.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case contains a single line with three space-separated integers $a, b$ and $k$ ($1\\leq a,b,k\\leq 10^5$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $\\max(a, b, k)$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$, denoting the answer to the problem. The values of $n$ and $m$ can be large, so output them modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n1 1 5\n\n2 2 2\n\n90000 80000 70000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 1\n3 7\n299929959 603196135\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, every $n\\times m$ matrix contains a $1\\times 1$ submatrix with all elements equal. $(1,1)$ is the lexicographically minimum tuple among all of them.\n\nFor the second test case, it can be verified that whatever $3\\times 7$ matrix Harshith gives to Aryan, Aryan can always win by finding a $2\\times 2$ submatrix with all elements equal. $(3,7)$ is also the lexicographically minimum tuple among all possible tuples where Aryan always wins.",
