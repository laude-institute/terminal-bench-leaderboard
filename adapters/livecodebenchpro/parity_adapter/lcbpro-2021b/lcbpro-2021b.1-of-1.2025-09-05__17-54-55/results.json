    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2021B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers and an integer $x$. You can do the following two-step operation any (possibly zero) number of times:\n\n1. Choose an index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n$).\n2. Increase $a_i$ by $x$, in other words $a_i := a_i + x$.\n\nFind the maximum value of the $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ if you perform the operations optimally.\n\nThe $\\operatorname{MEX}$ (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. For example:\n\n- The $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $[2,2,1]$ is $0$ because $0$ is not in the array.\n- The $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $[3,1,0,1]$ is $2$ because $0$ and $1$ are in the array but $2$ is not.\n- The $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $[0,3,1,2]$ is $4$ because $0$, $1$, $2$ and $3$ are in the array but $4$ is not.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $1 \\le x \\le 10^9$) -- the length of the array and the integer to be used in the operation.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the given array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ if you perform the operations optimally.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n6 3\n\n0 3 2 1 5 2\n\n6 2\n\n1 3 4 1 0 2\n\n4 5\n\n2 5 10 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n6\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ is $4$ without performing any operations, which is the maximum.\n\nIn the second test case, the $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ is $5$ without performing any operations. If we perform two operations both with $i=1$, we will have the array $a=[5,3,4,1,0,2]$. Then, the $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ will become $6$, which is the maximum.\n\nIn the third test case, the $\\operatorname{MEX}$ of $a$ is $0$ without performing any operations, which is the maximum.",
