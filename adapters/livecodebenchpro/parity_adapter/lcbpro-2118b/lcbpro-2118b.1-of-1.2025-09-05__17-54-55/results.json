    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2118B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere is a matrix $A$ of size $n\\times n$ where $A_{i,j}=j$ for all $1 \\le i,j \\le n$.\n\nIn one operation, you can select a row and reverse any subarray$^{\\text{∗}}$ in it.\n\nFind a sequence of at most $2n$ operations such that every column will contain a permutation$^{\\text{†}}$ of length $n$.\n\nIt can be proven that the construction is always possible. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$An array $a$ is a subarray of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deleting zero or more elements from the beginning and zero or more elements from the end.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 5000$) -- denoting the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, on the first line, print an integer $k$ $(0 \\le k \\le 2n)$, the number of operations you wish to perform. On the next lines, you should print the operations.\n\nTo print an operation, use the format \"$i\\;l\\;r$\" ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq i \\leq n$) which reverses the subarray $A_{i, l}$, $A_{i, l+1}$, $\\ldots$, $A_{i, r}$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n2 1 3\n2 2 3\n3 1 2\n3 2 3\n5\n2 1 4\n3 1 3\n3 2 4\n4 3 4\n4 1 2```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the following operations are a valid solution:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3b9509868f6d3b65d8a4a7a94688db76911f59b7.png)",
