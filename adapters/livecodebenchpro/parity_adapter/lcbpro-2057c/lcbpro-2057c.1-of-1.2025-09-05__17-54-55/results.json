    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2057C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn the upcoming year, there will be many team olympiads, so the teachers of \"T-generation\" need to assemble a team of three pupils to participate in them. Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...\n\nEach pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In \"T-generation\", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from $l$ to $r$, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels $a$, $b$, and $c$, the value of their team independence is equal to $(a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c)$, where $\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nYour task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case set contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($0 \\le l, r < 2^{30}$, $r - l > 1$) -- the minimum and maximum independence levels of the students.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case set, output three pairwise distinct integers $a, b$, and $c$, such that $l \\le a, b, c \\le r$ and the value of the expression $(a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c)$ is maximized. If there are multiple triples with the maximum value, any of them can be output.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n0 2\n\n0 8\n\n1 3\n\n6 22\n\n128 137\n\n69 98\n\n115 127\n\n0 1073741823\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 0\n8 7 1\n2 1 3\n7 16 11\n134 132 137\n98 85 76\n123 121 118\n965321865 375544086 12551794\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the only suitable triplet of numbers ($a, b, c$) (up to permutation) is ($0, 1, 2$).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the suitable triplets is ($8, 7, 1$), where $(8 \\oplus 7) + (7 \\oplus 1) + (8 \\oplus 1) = 15 + 6 + 9 = 30$. It can be shown that $30$ is the maximum possible value of $(a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c)$ for $0 \\le a, b, c \\le 8$.",
