    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1996G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOn Penacony, The Land of the Dreams, there exists $n$ houses and $n$ roads. There exists a road between house $i$ and $i+1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$ and a road between house $n$ and house $1$. All roads are bidirectional. However, due to the crisis on Penacony, the overseeing family has gone into debt and may not be able to maintain all roads.\n\nThere are $m$ pairs of friendships between the residents of Penacony. If the resident living in house $a$ is friends with the resident living in house $b$, there must be a path between houses $a$ and $b$ through maintained roads.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of roads that must be maintained?\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of houses and the number of friendships.\n\nThe next $m$ lines contain two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$) -- the resident in house $a$ is friends with the resident in house $b$. It is guaranteed all ($a, b$) are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of $n$ and $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of roads that must be maintained.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n8 3\n\n1 8\n\n2 7\n\n4 5\n\n13 4\n\n1 13\n\n2 12\n\n3 11\n\n4 10\n\n10 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n10 4\n\n3 8\n\n5 10\n\n2 10\n\n4 10\n\n4 1\n\n1 3\n\n5 2\n\n3 5\n\n1 4\n\n5 2\n\n2 5\n\n1 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n7\n2\n7\n2\n3\n3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, the following roads must be maintained:\n\n- $8 \\leftarrow \\rightarrow 1$\n- $7 \\leftarrow \\rightarrow 8$\n- $1 \\leftarrow \\rightarrow 2$\n- $4 \\leftarrow \\rightarrow 5$",
