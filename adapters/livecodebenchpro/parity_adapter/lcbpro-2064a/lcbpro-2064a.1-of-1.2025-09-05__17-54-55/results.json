    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2064A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOne day after waking up, your friend challenged you to a brogramming contest. In a brogramming contest, you are given a binary string$^{\\text{∗}}$ $s$ of length $n$ and an initially empty binary string $t$. During a brogramming contest, you can make either of the following moves any number of times:\n\n- remove some suffix$^{\\text{†}}$ from $s$ and place it at the end of $t$, or\n- remove some suffix from $t$ and place it at the end of $s$.\n\nTo win the brogramming contest, you must make the minimum number of moves required to make $s$ contain only the character $\\texttt{0}$ and $t$ contain only the character $\\texttt{1}$. Find the minimum number of moves required.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A binary string is a string consisting of characters $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A string $a$ is a suffix of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning of $b$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case is an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) -- the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the binary string $s$.\n\nThe sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each testcase, output the minimum number of moves required.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n5\n\n00110\n\n4\n\n1111\n\n3\n\n001\n\n5\n\n00000\n\n3\n\n101\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n1\n1\n0\n3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nAn optimal solution to the first test case is as follows:\n\n- $s = \\texttt{00}\\color{red}{\\texttt{110}}$, $t =$ empty string.\n- $s = \\texttt{00}$, $t = \\texttt{11}\\color{red}{\\texttt{0}}$.\n- $s = \\texttt{000}$, $t = \\texttt{11}$.\n\nIt can be proven that there is no solution using less than $2$ moves.\n\nIn the second test case, you have to move the whole string from $s$ to $t$ in one move.\n\nIn the fourth test case, you don't have to do any moves.",
