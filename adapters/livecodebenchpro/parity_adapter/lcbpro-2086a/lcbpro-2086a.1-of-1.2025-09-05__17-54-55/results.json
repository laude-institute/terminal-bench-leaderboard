    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2086A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThe most valuable berry of the Karelian forests is cloudberry. To make jam from cloudberries, you take equal amounts of berries and sugar and cook them. Thus, if you have $2$ kg of berries, you need $2$ kg of sugar. However, from $2$ kg of berries and $2$ kg of sugar, you will not get $4$ kg of jam, as one might expect, but only $3$ kg, since some of the jam evaporates during cooking. Specifically, during standard cooking, exactly a quarter (or $25\\%$) of the jam evaporates.\n\nHow many kilograms of cloudberries are needed to prepare $n$ $3$-kilogram jars of jam?\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/85e4f865ff1296d55236c63df0157f7da4c779b6.png)\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$) -- the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.\n\nEach test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^8$) -- the number of jars of jam that need to be prepared.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the amount of berries needed for the jam in kilograms.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n6\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the test case $1$, explanations are given in the text of the statement -- to prepare $1$ jar of jam, you need $2$ kilograms of cloudberries.\n\nConsider the test case $2$: if we take $6$ kilograms of berries and $6$ kilograms of sugar, we get $\\frac{(6 + 6) \\cdot 3}{4} = 9$ kilograms of jam; which gives $\\frac{9}{3} = 3$ jars of jam.",
