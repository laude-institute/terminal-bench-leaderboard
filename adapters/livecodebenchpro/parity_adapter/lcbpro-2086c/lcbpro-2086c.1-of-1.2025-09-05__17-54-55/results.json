    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2086C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nA permutation of integers from $1$ to $n$ is an array of size $n$ where each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once.\n\nYou are given a permutation $p$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. You have to process $n$ queries. During the $i$-th query, you replace $p_{d_i}$ with $0$. Each element is replaced with $0$ exactly once. The changes made in the queries are saved, that is, after the $i$-th query, all integers $p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, \\dots, p_{d_i}$ are zeroes.\n\nAfter each query, you have to find the minimum number of operations required to fix the array; in other words, to transform the current array into any permutation of integers from $1$ to $n$ (possibly into the original permutation $p$, possibly into some other permutation).\n\nThe operation you can perform to fix the array is the following one:\n\n- choose the integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$, replace the $i$-th element of the array with $i$.\n\nNote that the answer for each query is calculated independently, meaning you do not actually apply any operations, just calculate the minimum number of operations.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$) -- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{5}$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_{i} \\le n$) -- the original permutation. All $p_i$ are distinct.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$ ($1 \\le d_{i} \\le n$). All $d_{i}$ are distinct.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input:\n\n- the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^{5}$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing $n$ integers, where the $i$-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to fix the array which was obtained after the $i$-th query (i.e., the permutation $p$ where all integers $p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, \\dots, p_{d_i}$ are replaced by zeroes).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n3 2 1\n\n5\n\n4 5 3 1 2\n\n4 5 1 3 2\n\n7\n\n4 3 1 2 7 5 6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2 3\n2 4 4 5 5\n4 4 4 4 7 7 7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, after each query, every integer which was replaced by $0$ can be restored by one operation.\n\nIn the second test case, you can act as follows:\n\n- Query $1$: $p = [4, 5, 3, 0, 2]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, 5, 3, {\\color{red}4}, 2]$.\n- Query $2$: $p = [4, 5, 3, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, 3, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $3$: $p = [0, 5, 3, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, 3, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $4$: $p = [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, {\\color{red}3}, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n- Query $5$: $p = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$, it can be transformed into $[{\\color{red}1}, {\\color{red}2}, {\\color{red}3}, {\\color{red}4}, {\\color{red}5}]$.\n\nThe numbers that were changed are highlighted in red.",
