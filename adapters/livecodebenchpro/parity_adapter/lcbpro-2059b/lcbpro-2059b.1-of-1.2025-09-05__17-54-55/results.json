    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2059B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of length $n$ and an even integer $k$ ($2 \\le k \\le n$). You need to split the array $a$ into exactly $k$ non-empty subarrays$^{\\dagger}$ such that each element of the array $a$ belongs to exactly one subarray.\n\nNext, all subarrays with even indices (second, fourth, $\\ldots$, $k$-th) are concatenated into a single array $b$. After that, $0$ is added to the end of the array $b$.\n\nThe cost of the array $b$ is defined as the minimum index $i$ such that $b_i \\neq i$. For example, the cost of the array $b = [1, 2, 4, 5, 0]$ is $3$, since $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 2$, and $b_3 \\neq 3$. Determine the minimum cost of the array $b$ that can be obtained with an optimal partitioning of the array $a$ into subarrays.\n\n$^{\\dagger}$An array $x$ is a subarray of an array $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $k$ is even) -- the length of the array $a$ and the number of subarrays.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum cost of the array $b$ that can be obtained.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 2\n\n1 1 1\n\n8 8\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4\n\n5 4\n\n1 1 1 2 2\n\n5 4\n\n1 1 1000000000 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n5\n2\n1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there are only two possible partitionings: $[[1], [1, 1]]$ and $[[1, 1], [1]]$. In either case, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 \\ne 2$, so the cost is $2$.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one possible partitioning, where $b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]$, so the cost is $5$ ($b_5 = 0 \\ne 5$).\n\nIn the third test case, the following partitioning works: $[[1], [1, 1], [2], [2]]$. Then $b = [1, 1, 2, 0]$, and the cost is $2$.",
