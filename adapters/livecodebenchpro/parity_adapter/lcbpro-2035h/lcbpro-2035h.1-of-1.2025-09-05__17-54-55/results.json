    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2035H)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nI'm peakly productive and this is deep.\n\nYou are given two permutations$^{\\text{∗}}$ $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$.\n\nYou can perform the following three-step operation on permutation $a$:\n\n1. Choose an index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$).\n2. Cyclic shift $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{i-1}$ by $1$ to the right. If you had chosen $i = 1$, then this range doesn't exist, and you cyclic shift nothing.\n3. Cyclic shift $a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}, \\ldots, a_n$ by $1$ to the right. If you had chosen $i = n$, then this range doesn't exist, and you cyclic shift nothing.\n\nAfter the operation, $a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_{i-2},a_{i-1},a_i,a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2},\\ldots,a_{n-1}, a_n$ is transformed into $a_{i-1},a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-3},a_{i-2},a_i,a_n, a_{i + 1},\\ldots,a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}$.\n\nHere are some examples of operations done on the identity permutation $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]$ of length $7$:\n\n- If we choose $i = 3$, it will become $[2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]$.\n- If we choose $i = 1$, it will become $[1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$.\n- If we choose $i = 7$, it will become $[6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]$.\n\nNotably, position $i$ is not shifted.\n\nFind a construction using at most $2n$ operations to make $a$ equal to $b$ or print $-1$ if it is impossible. The number of operations does not need to be minimized. It can be shown that if it is possible to make $a$ equal to $b$, it is possible to do this within $2n$ operations.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the lengths of permutations $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) -- the values of permutation $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$) -- the values of permutation $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is a sequence of operations to transform $a$ into $b$, output a single integer $q$ ($0\\le q\\le 2n$) -- the number of operations in the first line and $q$ integers with the $i$-th number representing the index of the $i$-th operation in the second line.\n\nIf there is no sequence of operations, output $-1$ in the only line.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\n3\n\n2 1 3\n\n3 2 1\n\n8\n\n7 8 3 5 4 6 1 2\n\n2 1 6 4 5 3 8 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n\n-1\n2\n1 3\n7\n3 4 5 1 2 1 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first case, you can do no operation since $a=b$.\n\nIn the second case, it can be proved $a$ can not be transformed into $b$.\n\nIn the third case, $a$ is transformed into $[2,3,1]$ after the first operation and into $b$ after the second operation.",
