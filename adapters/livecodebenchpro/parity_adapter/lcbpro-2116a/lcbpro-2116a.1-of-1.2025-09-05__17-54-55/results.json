    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2116A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nGellyfish and Flower are playing a game called \"Duel\".\n\nGellyfish has $a$ HP, while Flower has $b$ HP.\n\nEach of them has a knight. Gellyfish's knight has $c$ HP, while Flower's knight has $d$ HP.\n\nThey will play a game in rounds until one of the players wins. For $k = 1, 2, \\ldots$ in this order, they will perform the following actions:\n\n- If $k$ is odd and Gellyfish's knight is alive:\n- Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower and reduce $b$ by $1$. If $b \\leq 0$, Gellyfish wins. Or,\n- Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower's knight and reduce $d$ by $1$. If $d \\leq 0$, Flower's knight dies.\n- If $k$ is even and Flower's knight is alive:\n- Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish and reduce $a$ by $1$. If $a \\leq 0$, Flower wins. Or,\n- Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish's knight and reduce $c$ by $1$. If $c \\leq 0$, Gellyfish's knight dies.\n\nAs one of the smartest people in the world, you want to tell them who will win before the game. Assume both players play optimally.\n\nIt can be proven that the game will never end in a draw. That is, one player has a strategy to end the game in a finite number of moves.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ ($1 \\leq a, b, c, d \\leq 10^9$)Â -- the HP of Gellyfish, the HP of Flower, the HP of Gellyfish's knight, and the HP of Flower's knight, respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if Flower will win, output \"Flower\", otherwise output \"Gellyfish\".\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n100 999 1 1\n\n10 20 10 30\n\n12 14 13 11\n\n998 244 353 107\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nFlower\nGellyfish\nFlower\nGellyfish\nGellyfish\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Gellyfish has only $1$ HP. Therefore, no matter what Gellyfish does in the first round, Flower's knight will attack Gellyfish in the second round, allowing Flower to win.\n\nIn the second test case, Flower's knight has only $1$ HP. Gellyfish will attack Flower's knight in the first round. Then Flower's knight will no longer be able to attack, allowing Gellyfish to win.",
