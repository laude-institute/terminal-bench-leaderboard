    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2084C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a permutation $a$ and $b$ of length $n$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$. You can perform the following operation at most $n$ times:\n\n- Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i, j \\le n$, $i \\ne j$), swap $a_i$ with $a_j$, swap $b_i$ with $b_j$.\n\nDetermine whether $a$ and $b$ can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, $a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}$.\n\nIf it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output $-1$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the permutations.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$).\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that $a$ and $b$ are permutations of length $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if it is impossible, output $-1$ in the only line. Otherwise, output a single integer $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le n$) -- the number of operations in the first line. In the following $m$ lines, output two integers -- the indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i, j \\le n$, $i \\ne j$) in each operation in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\n4\n\n1 3 2 4\n\n2 4 1 3\n\n5\n\n2 5 1 3 4\n\n3 5 4 2 1\n\n5\n\n3 1 2 4 5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1\n0\n1\n1 2\n2\n1 2\n1 3\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the second test case, $b$ is already the reverse of $a$.\n\nIn the third test case, after performing the following operation, $b$ will become the reverse of $a$:\n\n- Swap $a_1, a_2$ and swap $b_1, b_2$. Now $a = [3, 1, 2, 4]$ and $b = [4, 2, 1, 3]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, after performing the following operations in order, $b$ will become the reverse of $a$:\n\n- Swap $a_1, a_2$ and swap $b_1, b_2$. Now $a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]$ and $b = [5, 3, 4, 2, 1]$.\n- Swap $a_1, a_3$ and swap $b_1, b_3$. Now $a = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]$ and $b = [4, 3, 5, 2, 1]$.",
