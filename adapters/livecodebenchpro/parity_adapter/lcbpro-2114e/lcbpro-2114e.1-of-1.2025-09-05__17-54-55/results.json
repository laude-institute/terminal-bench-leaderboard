    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2114E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nOnce, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with $n$ vertices, with the root at vertex $1$. Each vertex of the tree has a number $a_i$ recorded, which represents the danger of vertex $i$. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nFor a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximumalternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex $i$ is defined as $a_i - a_{p_i} + a_{p_{p_i}} - \\ldots$, where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ on the path to the root (to vertex $1$).\n\nFor example, in the tree below, vertex $4$ has the following vertical paths:\n\n- $[4]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 = 6$;\n- $[4, 3]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 = 6 - 2 = 4$;\n- $[4, 3, 2]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$;\n- $[4, 3, 2, 1]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 6 - 2 + 5 - 4 = 5$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1d786fdded1f234d101767c2c7b55e98960c8af0.png)The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red.\n\nHelp Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe following describes the test cases.\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the dangers of the vertices.\n\nThe next $n - 1$ lines contain the numbers $v, u$ ($1 \\le v, u \\le n$, $v \\neq u$) -- the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$. It is also guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers -- the threat of each vertex.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n5\n\n4 5 2 6 7\n\n1 2\n\n3 2\n\n4 3\n\n5 1\n\n6\n\n1000000000 500500500 900900900 9 404 800800800\n\n3 4\n\n5 1\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n6 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4 5 2 9 7\n1000000000 1500500096 1701701691 199199209 404 800800800\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe tree from the first test case is depicted in the statement, and the maximum variable-sign sums are achieved as follows:\n\n1. $a_1 = 4$;\n2. $a_2 = 5$;\n3. $a_3 = 2$;\n4. $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$;\n5. $a_5 = 7$.",
