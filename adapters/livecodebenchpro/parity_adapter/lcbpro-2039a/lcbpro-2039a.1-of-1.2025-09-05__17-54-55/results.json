    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2039A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nShohag has an integer $n$. Please help him find an increasing integer sequence $1 \\le a_1 \\lt a_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt a_n \\le 100$ such that $a_i \\bmod i \\neq a_j \\bmod j$ $^{\\text{∗}}$ is satisfied over all pairs $1 \\le i \\lt j \\le n$.\n\nIt can be shown that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$a \\\\bmod b$ denotes the remainder of $a$ after division by $b$. For example, $7 \\\\bmod 3 = 1, 8 \\\\bmod 4 = 0$ and $69 \\\\bmod 10 = 9$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 50$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print $n$ integers -- the integer sequence that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such sequences, output any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2 7 8\n2 3 32 35 69 95\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the sequence is increasing, values are from $1$ to $100$ and each pair of indices satisfies the condition mentioned in the statement:\n\n- For pair $(1, 2)$, $a_1 \\bmod 1 = 2 \\bmod 1 = 0$, and $a_2 \\bmod 2 = 7 \\bmod 2 = 1$. So they are different.\n- For pair $(1, 3)$, $a_1 \\bmod 1 = 2 \\bmod 1 = 0$, and $a_3 \\bmod 3 = 8 \\bmod 3 = 2$. So they are different.\n- For pair $(2, 3)$, $a_2 \\bmod 2 = 7 \\bmod 2 = 1$, and $a_3 \\bmod 3 = 8 \\bmod 3 = 2$. So they are different.\n\nNote that you do not necessarily have to print the exact same sequence, you can print any other sequence as long as it satisfies the necessary conditions.",
