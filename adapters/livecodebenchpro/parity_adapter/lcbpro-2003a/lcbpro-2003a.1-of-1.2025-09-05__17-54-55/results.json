    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2003A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nTurtle thinks a string $s$ is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_k$ ($k$ is an arbitrary integer) such that:\n\n- $k \\ge 2$.\n- $s = t_1 + t_2 + \\ldots + t_k$, where $+$ represents the concatenation operation. For example, $\\texttt{abc} = \\texttt{a} + \\texttt{bc}$.\n- For all $1 \\le i < j \\le k$, the first character of $t_i$ isn't equal to the last character of $t_j$.\n\nTurtle is given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string $s$ is a good string!\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) -- the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if the string $s$ is a good string, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2\n\naa\n\n3\n\naba\n\n4\n\nabcb\n\n12\n\nabcabcabcabc\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNo\nnO\nYes\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the sequence of strings $\\texttt{a}, \\texttt{a}$ satisfies the condition $s = t_1 + t_2 + \\ldots + t_k$, but the first character of $t_1$ is equal to the last character of $t_2$. It can be seen that there doesn't exist any sequence of strings which satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is \"NO\".\n\nIn the third test case, the sequence of strings $\\texttt{ab}, \\texttt{cb}$ satisfies all of the conditions.\n\nIn the fourth test case, the sequence of strings $\\texttt{abca}, \\texttt{bcab}, \\texttt{cabc}$ satisfies all of the conditions.",
