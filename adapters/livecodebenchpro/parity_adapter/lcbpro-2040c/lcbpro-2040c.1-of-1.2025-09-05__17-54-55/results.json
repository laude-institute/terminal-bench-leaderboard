    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2040C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nConsider a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. We can introduce the following sum for it$^{\\text{†}}$:\n\n\n\n$$S(p) = \\sum_{1 \\le l \\le r \\le n} \\min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, \\ldots, p_r)$$\n\nLet us consider all permutations of length $n$ with the maximum possible value of $S(p)$. Output the $k$-th of them in lexicographical$^{\\text{‡}}$order, or report that there are less than $k$ of them.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$For example:\n\n- For the permutation $[1, 2, 3]$ the value of $S(p)$ is equal to $\\min(1) + \\min(1, 2) + \\min(1, 2, 3) + \\min(2) + \\min(2, 3) + \\min(3) =$ $1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10$\n- For the permutation $[2, 4, 1, 3]$ the value of $S(p)$ is equal to $\\min(2) + \\min(2, 4) + \\min(2, 4, 1) + \\min(2, 4, 1, 3) \\ +$ $ \\min(4) + \\min(4, 1) + \\min(4, 1, 3) \\ +$ $\\min(1) + \\min(1, 3) \\ +$ $\\min(3) =$ $2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17$.\n\n$^{\\text{‡}}$An array $a$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $b$ if and only if one of the following holds:\n\n- $a$ is a prefix of $b$, but $a \\ne b$; or\n- in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, the array $a$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $b$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$; $1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$) -- the length of the permutation and the index number of the desired permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if there are less than $k$ suitable permutations, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print the $k$-th suitable permutation.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n3 2\n\n3 3\n\n4 11\n\n4 6\n\n6 39\n\n7 34\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 3 2\n2 3 1\n-1\n2 4 3 1\n-1\n2 3 4 5 7 6 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet us calculate the required sum for all permutations of length $3$ (ordered lexicographically):\n\nPermutationValue of $S(p)\n\n$$[1, 2, 3]$$\n\n10\n\n$$[1, 3, 2]$$\n\n10\n\n$$[2, 1, 3]$$\n\n9\n\n$$[2, 3, 1]$$\n\n10\n\n$$[3, 1, 2]$$\n\n9\n\n$$[3, 2, 1]$$\n\n10$\n\nIn the first test case, you have to print the second suitable permutation of length $3$. Looking at the table, we see that it is the permutation $[1, 3, 2]$.\n\nIn the second test case, you have to print the third suitable permutation of length $3$. Looking at the table, we see that it is the permutation $[2, 3, 1]$.",
