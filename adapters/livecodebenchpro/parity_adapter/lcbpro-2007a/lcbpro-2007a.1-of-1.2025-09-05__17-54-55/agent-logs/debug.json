In the beginning, she will put all integers in $[l, r]$ into the set $s$. That is, an integer $x$ is initially contained in the set if and only if $l \\leq x \\leq r$. Then she allows you to perform the following operations:\n\n- Select three distinct integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the set $s$, such that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, c) = \\gcd(a, c) = 1^\\dagger$.\n- Then, remove these three integers from the set $s$.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of operations you can perform?\n\n$^\\dagger$Recall that $\\gcd(x, y)$ means the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of integers $x$ and $y$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 500$)\u00a0-- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 1000$)\u00a0-- the range of integers in the initial set.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum number of operations you can perform.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n1 3\n\n3 7\n\n10 21\n\n2 8\n\n51 60\n\n2 15\n\n10 26\n\n1 1000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n3\n4\n250\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose $a = 1$, $b = 2$, $c = 3$ in the only operation, since $\\gcd(1, 2) = \\gcd(2, 3) = \\gcd(1, 3) = 1$, and then there are no more integers in the set, so no more operations can be performed.\n\nIn the second test case, you can choose $a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = 7$ in the only operation.\n\nIn the third test case, you can choose $a = 11$, $b = 19$, $c = 20$ in the first operation, $a = 13$, $b = 14$, $c = 15$ in the second operation, and $a = 10$, $b = 17$, $c = 21$ in the third operation. After the three operations, the set $s$ contains the following integers: $12$, $16$, $18$. It can be proven that it's impossible to perform more than $3$ operations.\n\nGenerate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.\n\nFor competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:\n1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp\n2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout\n3. Handle multiple test cases if specified\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures\n\nReturn your response in JSON format with two fields:\n\n1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute\n2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do\n\nExample response format:\n\n{\n    \"commands\": [\"cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main() {\\n    // solution code\\n    return 0;\\n}\\nEOF\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"Create C++ solution file\"\n}\n\nDon't include markdown formatting."
