    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2014A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThere is a little bit of the outlaw in everyone, and a little bit of the hero too.\n\nThe heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor.\n\nRobin encounters $n$ people starting from the $1$-st and ending with the $n$-th. The $i$-th person has $a_i$ gold. If $a_i \\ge k$, Robin will take all $a_i$ gold, and if $a_i=0$, Robin will give $1$ gold if he has any. Robin starts with $0$ gold.\n\nFind out how many people Robin gives gold to.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50, 1 \\le k \\le 100$) -- the number of people and the threshold at which Robin Hood takes the gold.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 100$) -- the gold of each person.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of people that will get gold from Robin Hood.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 2\n\n2 0\n\n3 2\n\n3 0 0\n\n6 2\n\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n2 5\n\n5 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Robin takes $2$ gold from the first person and gives a gold to the second person.\n\nIn the second test case, Robin takes $3$ gold and gives $1$ gold to each of the next $2$ people.\n\nIn the third test case, Robin takes $3$ gold and so only gives gold to $3$ other people.",
