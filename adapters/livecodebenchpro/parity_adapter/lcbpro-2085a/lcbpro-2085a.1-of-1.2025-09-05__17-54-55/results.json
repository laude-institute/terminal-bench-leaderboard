    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2085A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nA string $r$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters is called universal if and only if $r$ is lexicographically smaller$^{\\text{∗}}$ than the reversal$^{\\text{†}}$ of $r$.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters. You are required to make $s$ universal. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation on $s$ at most $k$ times:\n\n- Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1\\le i,j\\le n$), then swap $s_i$ and $s_j$. Note that if $i=j$, you do nothing.\n\nDetermine whether you can make $s$ universal by performing the above operation at most $k$ times.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A string $a$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $b$ of the same length, if and only if the following holds:\n\n- in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, the string $a$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $b$.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$The reversal of a string $r$ is the string obtained by writing $r$ from right to left. For example, the reversal of the string $\\texttt{abcad}$ is $\\texttt{dacba}$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1\\le n\\le 100$, $0\\le k\\le 10^4$) -- the length of the string $s$, and the maximum number of operations you can perform.\n\nThe second line contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to make $s$ universal by performing the operation at most $k$ times. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n1 10000\n\na\n\n3 3\n\nrev\n\n6 0\n\nstring\n\n6 0\n\ntheory\n\n9 2\n\nuniversal\n\n19 0\n\ncodeforcesecrofedoc\n\n19 1\n\ncodeforcesecrofedoc\n\n3 1\n\nzzz\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $s$ will keep the same after any operations. However, the reversal of $\\texttt{a}$ is still $\\texttt{a}$, so it is impossible to make $s$ universal.\n\nIn the second test case, the string $\\texttt{rev}$ is lexicographically smaller than $\\texttt{ver}$. Thus, $s$ is already universal.\n\nIn the fifth test case, you can perform the operations as follows:\n\n1. Swap $s_4$ and $s_7$. After this operation, $s$ becomes $\\texttt{uniserval}$;\n2. Swap $s_1$ and $s_3$. After this operation, $s$ becomes $\\texttt{inuserval}$.\n\nAnd the string $\\texttt{inuserval}$ is universal.",
