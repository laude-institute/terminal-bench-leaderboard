    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1994A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nPetr, watching Sergey's stream, came up with a matrix $a$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns (the number in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is denoted as $a_{i, j}$), which contains all integers from $1$ to $n \\cdot m$. But he didn't like the arrangement of the numbers, and now he wants to come up with a new matrix $b$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, which will also contain all integers from $1$ to $n \\cdot m$, such that for any $1 \\leq i \\leq n, 1 \\leq j \\leq m$ it holds that $a_{i, j} \\ne b_{i, j}$.\n\nYou are given the matrix $a$, construct any matrix $b$ that meets Petr's requirements, or determine that it is impossible.\n\nHurry up! Otherwise, he will donate all his money to the stream in search of an answer to his question.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$) -- the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10$) -- the number of rows and columns of matrix $a$.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each, describing matrix $a$. The $i$-th of these lines contains the elements of matrix $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, m}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all numbers in matrix $a$ are distinct and $1 \\leq a_{i, j} \\leq n \\cdot m$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^4$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n \\cdot m$ integers -- any suitable matrix $b$, or $-1$ if such a matrix does not exist.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n2 1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1 5\n\n2 4 5 3 1\n\n2 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n5 6 7 8\n\n3 3\n\n4 2 1\n\n9 8 3\n\n6 7 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1\n1\n2\n4 5 3 1 2\n6 7 8 5\n2 3 4 1\n8 3 9\n7 5 6\n2 1 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there is only one element in the matrix, so matrix $b$ is the only matrix and it does not fit.\n\nIn the second test case $a_{1, 1} = 2 \\neq 1 = b_{1, 1}$, $a_{2, 1} = 1 \\neq 2 = b_{2, 1}$.",
