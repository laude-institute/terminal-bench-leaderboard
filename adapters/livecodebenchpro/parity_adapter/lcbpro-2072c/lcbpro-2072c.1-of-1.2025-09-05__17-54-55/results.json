    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2072C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAkito still has nowhere to live, and the price for a small room is everywhere. For this reason, Akito decided to get a job at a bank as a key creator for storages.\n\nIn this magical world, everything is different. For example, the key for a storage with the code $(n, x)$ is an array $a$ of length $n$ such that:\n\n- $a_1 \\ | \\ a_2 \\ | \\ a_3 \\ | \\ \\ldots \\ | \\ a_n = x$, where $a \\ | \\ b$ is the [bitwise \"OR\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) of numbers $a$ and $b$.\n- $\\\\text{MEX}(\\\\{ a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, \\\\ldots, a\\_n \\\\})$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$ is maximized among all such arrays.\n\nAkito diligently performed his job for several hours, but suddenly he got a headache. Substitute for him for an hour; for the given $n$ and $x$, create any key for the storage with the code $(n, x)$.\n\n$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$\\\\text{MEX}(S)$ is the minimum non-negative integer $z$ such that $z$ is not contained in the set $S$ and all $0 \\\\le y < z$ are contained in $S$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains the number $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nIn the only line of each test case, two numbers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 0 \\le x < 2^{30}$) are given -- the length of the array and the desired value of the bitwise \"OR\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers $a_i$ ($0 \\le a_i < 2^{30}$) -- the elements of the key array that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nIf there are multiple suitable arrays, output any of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n1 69\n\n7 7\n\n5 7\n\n7 3\n\n8 7\n\n3 52\n\n9 11\n\n6 15\n\n2 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n69\n6 0 3 4 1 2 5\n4 1 3 0 2\n0 1 2 3 2 1 0\n7 0 6 1 5 2 4 3\n0 52 0\n0 1 8 3 0 9 11 2 10\n4 0 3 8 1 2\n0 3```",
