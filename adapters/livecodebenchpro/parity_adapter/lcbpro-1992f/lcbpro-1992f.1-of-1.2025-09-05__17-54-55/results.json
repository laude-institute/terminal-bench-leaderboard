Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1992F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn his favorite cafe Kmes once again wanted to try the herring under a fur coat. Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.\n\nNow, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: $n$ cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the $i$-th card there is an integer $a_i$, among these prices there is no whole positive integer $x$.\n\nKmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number of bad segments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is considered bad if it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to $x$. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must be bad.\n\nFormally, the segment $(l, r)$ is bad if there are no indices $i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k$ such that $l \\le i_1, i_k \\le r$, and $a_{i_1} \\cdot a_{i_2} \\ldots \\cdot a_{i_k} = x$.\n\nHelp Kmes determine the minimum number of bad segments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each set of input data gives you $2$ integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 2 \\le x \\le 10^5$) -- the number of cards and the integer, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each set of input data contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, a_i \\neq x$) -- the prices on the cards.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all sets of test data does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each set of input data, output the minimum number of bad segments.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n6 4\n\n2 3 6 2 1 2\n\n9 100000\n\n50000 25000 12500 6250 3125 2 4 8 16\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n8 6\n\n4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3\n\n7 12\n\n6 11 1 3 11 10 2\n\n10 5\n\n2 4 4 2 4 4 4 3 1 1\n\n7 8\n\n4 6 5 1 2 4 1\n\n8 27\n\n3 9 17 26 2 20 9 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n3\n3\n```",
