    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2061F1)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, string $t$ consists of only '0' and '1'. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nKevin has a binary string $s$ of length $n$. Kevin can perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose two adjacent blocks of $s$ and swap them.\n\nA block is a maximal substring$^{\\text{∗}}$ of identical characters. Formally, denote $s[l,r]$ as the substring $s_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_r$. A block is $s[l,r]$ satisfying:\n\n- $l=1$ or $s_l\\not=s_{l-1}$.\n- $s_l=s_{l+1} = \\ldots = s_{r}$.\n- $r=n$ or $s_r\\not=s_{r+1}$.\n\nAdjacent blocks are two blocks $s[l_1,r_1]$ and $s[l_2,r_2]$ satisfying $r_1+1=l_2$.\n\nFor example, if $s=\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathtt{111}$, Kevin can choose the two blocks $s[4,5]$ and $s[6,7]$ and swap them, transforming $s$ into $\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathtt{111}$.\n\nGiven a string $t$ of length $n$ consisting of '0', '1' and '?', Kevin wants to determine the minimum number of operations required to perform such that for any index $i$ ($1\\le i\\le n$), if $t_i\\not=$ '?' then $s_i=t_i$. If it is impossible, output $-1$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A string $a$ is a substring of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string $s$ consisting of '0' and '1'.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $t$ consisting of '0' and '1'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the lengths of $s$ and $t$ are the same.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the length of $s$ over all test cases will not exceed $4\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer -- the minimum number of operations required. If it is impossible, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n0001100111\n\n0000011111\n\n010101\n\n111000\n\n0101\n\n0110\n\n0101\n\n1010\n\n011001\n\n001110\n\n0\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n3\n1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, the possible way is shown in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case, one possible way could be:\n\n- Swap blocks $[2, 2], [3, 3]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{001101}$.\n- Swap blocks $[3, 4], [5, 5]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{000111}$.\n- Swap blocks $[1, 3], [4, 6]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{111000}$.",
