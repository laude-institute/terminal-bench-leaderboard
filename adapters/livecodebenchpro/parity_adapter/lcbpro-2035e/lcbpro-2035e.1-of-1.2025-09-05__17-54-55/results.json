    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2035E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMan, this Genshin boss is so hard. Good thing they have a top-up of $6$ coins for only $ \\$4.99$. I should be careful and spend no more than I need to, lest my mom catches me...\n\nYou are fighting a monster with $z$ health using a weapon with $d$ damage. Initially, $d=0$. You can perform the following operations.\n\n- Increase $d$ -- the damage of your weapon by $1$, costing $x$ coins.\n- Attack the monster, dealing $d$ damage and costing $y$ coins.\n\nYou cannot perform the first operation for more than $k$ times in a row.\n\nFind the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster by dealing at least $z$ damage.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains 4 integers $x$, $y$, $z$, and $k$ ($1\\leq x, y, z, k\\leq 10^8$) -- the first operation's cost, the second operation's cost, the monster's health, and the limitation on the first operation.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 3 5 5\n\n10 20 40 5\n\n1 60 100 10\n\n60 1 100 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n12\n190\n280\n160\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $x = 2$, $y = 3$, $z = 5$, and $k = 5$. Here's a strategy that achieves the lowest possible cost of $12$ coins:\n\n- Increase damage by $1$, costing $2$ coins.\n- Increase damage by $1$, costing $2$ coins.\n- Increase damage by $1$, costing $2$ coins.\n- Attack the monster, dealing $3$ damage, costing $3$ coins.\n- Attack the monster, dealing $3$ damage, costing $3$ coins.\n\nYou deal a total of $3 + 3 = 6$ damage, defeating the monster who has $5$ health. The total number of coins you use is $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12$ coins.\n\nIn the second test case, $x = 10$, $y = 20$, $z = 40$, and $k = 5$. Here's a strategy that achieves the lowest possible cost of $190$ coins:\n\n- Increase damage by $5$, costing $5\\cdot x$ = $50$ coins.\n- Attack the monster once, dealing $5$ damage, costing $20$ coins.\n- Increase damage by $2$, costing $2\\cdot x$ = $20$ coins.\n- Attack the monster $5$ times, dealing $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ damage, costing $5\\cdot y$ = $100$ coins.\n\nYou deal a total of $5 + 35 = 40$ damage, defeating the monster who has exactly $40$ health. The total number of coins you use is $50 + 20 + 20 + 100 = 190$ coins.",
