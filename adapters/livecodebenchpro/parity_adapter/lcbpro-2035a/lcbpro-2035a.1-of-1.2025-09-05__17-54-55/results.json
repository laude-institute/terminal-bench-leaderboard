    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2035A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nRed was ejected. They were not the imposter.\n\nThere are $n$ rows of $m$ people. Let the position in the $r$-th row and the $c$-th column be denoted by $(r, c)$. Number each person starting from $1$ in row-major order, i.e., the person numbered $(r-1)\\cdot m+c$ is initially at $(r,c)$.\n\nThe person at $(r, c)$ decides to leave. To fill the gap, let the person who left be numbered $i$. Each person numbered $j>i$ will move to the position where the person numbered $j-1$ is initially at. The following diagram illustrates the case where $n=2$, $m=3$, $r=1$, and $c=2$.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b24389738aac41115cbf116d0cb49065a5710c74.png)\n\nCalculate the sum of the Manhattan distances of each person's movement. If a person was initially at $(r_0, c_0)$ and then moved to $(r_1, c_1)$, the Manhattan distance is $|r_0-r_1|+|c_0-c_1|$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 10^4$)Â -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each testcase contains $4$ integers $n$, $m$, $r$, and $c$ ($1\\le r\\le n\\le 10^6$, $1 \\le c \\le m \\le 10^6$), where $n$ is the number of rows, $m$ is the number of columns, and $(r,c)$ is the position where the person who left is initially at.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the sum of the Manhattan distances.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 2\n\n2 2 2 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1000000 1000000 1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n6\n1\n0\n1999998000000\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, the person numbered $2$ leaves, and the distances of the movements of the person numbered $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ are $1$, $3$, $1$, and $1$, respectively. So the answer is $1+3+1+1=6$.\n\nFor the second test case, the person numbered $3$ leaves, and the person numbered $4$ moves. The answer is $1$.",
