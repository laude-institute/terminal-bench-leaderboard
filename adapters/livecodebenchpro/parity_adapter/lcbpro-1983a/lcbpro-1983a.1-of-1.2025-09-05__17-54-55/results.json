    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1983A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAn array of integers $a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_n$ is beautiful subject to an integer $k$ if it satisfies the following:\n\n- The sum of $a_{j}$ over all $j$ such that $j$ is a multiple of $k$ and $1 \\le j \\le n $, itself, is a multiple of $k$.\n- More formally, if $\\sum_{k | j} a_{j}$ is divisible by $k$ for all $1 \\le j \\le n$ then the array $a$ is beautiful subject to $k$. Here, the notation ${k|j}$ means $k$ divides $j$, that is, $j$ is a multiple of $k$.\n\nGiven $n$, find an array of positive nonzero integers, with each element less than or equal to $10^5$ that is beautiful subject to all $1 \\le k \\le n$.\n\nIt can be shown that an answer always exists.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)Â -- the size of the array.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print the required array as described in the problem statement.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n3\n3\n6\n7\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4 22 18\n10 6 15 32 125 54\n23 18 27 36 5 66 7```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the second test case, when $n = 6$, for all integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le 6$, let $S$ be the set of all indices of the array that are divisible by $k$.\n\n- When $k = 1$, $S = \\{1, 2, 3,4,5,6\\}$ meaning $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6=242$ must be divisible by $1$.\n- When $k = 2$, $S = \\{2,4,6\\}$ meaning $a_2+a_4+a_6=92$ must be divisible by $2$.\n- When $k = 3$, $S = \\{3,6\\}$ meaning $a_3+a_6=69$ must divisible by $3$.\n- When $k = 4$, $S = \\{4\\}$ meaning $a_4=32$ must divisible by $4$.\n- When $k = 5$, $S = \\{5\\}$ meaning $a_5=125$ must divisible by $5$.\n- When $k = 6$, $S = \\{6\\}$ meaning $a_6=54$ must divisible by $6$.\n\nThe array $a = [10, 6, 15, 32, 125, 54]$ satisfies all of the above conditions. Hence, $a$ is a valid array.",
