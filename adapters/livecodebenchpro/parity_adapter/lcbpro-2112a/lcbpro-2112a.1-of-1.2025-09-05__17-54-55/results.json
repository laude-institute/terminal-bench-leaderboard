    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2112A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAlice and Bob participate in a game TV show. When the game starts, the prize will be dropped to a certain point, and whoever gets to it first will get the prize.\n\nAlice decided that she would start running from point $a$. Bob, however, has not yet chosen his starting position.\n\nBob knows that the prize could drop either at point $x$ or at point $y$. He also knows that he can reach the prize faster than Alice if the distance from his starting position to the prize is strictly less than the distance from Alice's starting position to the prize. The distance between any two points $c$ and $d$ is calculated as $|c-d|$.\n\nYour task is to determine whether Bob can choose an integer point that is guarantee to get to the prize faster, regardless of where it appears (at point $x$ or $y$). Bob can choose any integer point, except for $a$ (in particular, he can choose to start in point $x$, point $y$, or any other point, but not $a$).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)Â -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers $a$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \\le a, x, y \\le 100$). Points $a$, $x$, and $y$ are pairwise distinct.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (case insensitive) if Bob can choose an integer point that is guarantee to get to the prize faster, regardless of where it appears. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (case insensitive).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n1 3 4\n\n5 3 1\n\n3 1 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, Bob can choose point $4$. If the prize will be at point $x$, then Bob's distance is $|4-3|=1$ and Alice's distance is $|1-3|=2$. If the prize will be at point $y$, then Bob's distance is $|4-4|=0$ and Alice's distance is $|1-4|=3$.\n\nIn the second example, Bob can choose point $2$. If the prize will be at point $x$, then Bob's distance is $|2-3|=1$ and Alice's distance is $|5-3|=2$. If the prize will be at point $y$, then Bob's distance is $|2-1|=1$ and Alice's distance is $|5-1|=4$.\n\nIn the third example, Bob cannot choose a point to guarantee his victory.",
