    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2093C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nPasha loves prime numbers$^{\\text{∗}}$! Once again, in his attempts to find a new way to generate prime numbers, he became interested in an algorithm he found on the internet:\n\n- To obtain a new number $y$, repeat $k$ times the decimal representation of the number $x$ (without leading zeros).\n\nFor example, for $x = 52$ and $k = 3$, we get $y = 525252$, and for $x = 6$ and $k = 7$, we get $y = 6666666$.\n\nPasha really wants the resulting number $y$ to be prime, but he doesn't yet know how to check the primality of numbers generated by this algorithm. Help Pasha and tell him whether $y$ is prime!\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$An integer $x$ is considered prime if it has exactly $2$ distinct divisors: $1$ and $x$. For example, $13$ is prime because it has only $2$ divisors: $1$ and $13$. Note that the number $1$ is not prime, as it has only one divisor.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of sets of input data. The following lines describe the sets of input data.\n\nThe first and only line of each data set contains two integers: $x$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 7$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each set of input data, output «YES» (without quotes) if the resulting number $y$ will be prime, and «NO» otherwise.\n\nYou may output «Yes» and «No» in any case (for example, the strings «yES», «yes», and «Yes» will be recognized as positive answers).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n52 3\n\n6 7\n\n7 1\n\n1 7\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```",
