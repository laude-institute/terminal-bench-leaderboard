The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0-- the number of rows of the polyomino.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1\\le l_i\\le r_i\\le 10^9$)\u00a0-- the range of columns that are part of the polyomino in the $i$-th row.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the area of the polyomino is even. In other words, $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i - l_i + 1\\equiv 0\\pmod{2}$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing either \"YES\" or \"NO\", representing whether or not the polyomino can be partitioned as described in the problem.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n4\n\n4 4\n\n2 4\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n3 3\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 3\n\n4\n\n8 9\n\n6 8\n\n6 8\n\n5 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first and second test cases are the polyominoes depicted in the problem statement and can be partitioned as shown.\n\nThe polyomino in the third test case, shown below, can be shown to be impossible to partition. None of the following partitions are valid:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/0a986911d905df1d700e5c6e0a7823b6baa1714b.png)\n\nThe partition on the left does not use polyominoes that are translations of each other, and the partition on the right does not use connected polyominoes.\n\nThe polyomino in the fourth test case, shown below, can be shown to be impossible to partition.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5f032563bda214bb7c65076b4882bda7d0a17e46.png)\n\nNote that while you can partition it into two $1 \\times 2$ rectangles, these rectangles are not translations of each other.\n\nGenerate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.\n\nFor competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:\n1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp\n2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout\n3. Handle multiple test cases if specified\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures\n\nReturn your response in JSON format with two fields:\n\n1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute\n2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do\n\nExample response format:\n\n{\n    \"commands\": [\"cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main() {\\n    // solution code\\n    return 0;\\n}\\nEOF\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"Create C++ solution file\"\n}\n\nDon't include markdown formatting."
