    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2050G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nGiven a tree$^{\\text{∗}}$ with $n$ vertices. You can choose two vertices $a$ and $b$ once and remove all vertices on the path from $a$ to $b$, including the vertices themselves. If you choose $a=b$, only one vertex will be removed.\n\nYour task is to find the maximum number of connected components$^{\\text{†}}$ that can be formed after removing the path from the tree.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\n\n$^{\\text{†}}$A connected component is a set of vertices such that there is a path along the edges from any vertex to any other vertex in the set (and it is not possible to reach vertices not belonging to this set)\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the size of the tree.\n\nThe next $n-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n$, $u \\ne v$) -- the vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer -- the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved using the described operation.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n3 5\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n5\n\n2 1\n\n3 1\n\n4 1\n\n5 4\n\n6\n\n2 1\n\n3 1\n\n4 1\n\n5 3\n\n6 3\n\n6\n\n2 1\n\n3 2\n\n4 2\n\n5 3\n\n6 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n3\n2\n3\n4\n3\n```",
