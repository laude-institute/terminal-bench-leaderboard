    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2062A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of $\\mathtt{0}$ and/or $\\mathtt{1}$. In one operation, you can select a non-empty subsequence $t$ from $s$ such that any two adjacent characters in $t$ are different. Then, you flip each character of $t$ ($\\mathtt{0}$ becomes $\\mathtt{1}$ and $\\mathtt{1}$ becomes $\\mathtt{0}$). For example, if $s=\\mathtt{\\underline{0}0\\underline{101}}$ and $t=s_1s_3s_4s_5=\\mathtt{0101}$, after the operation, $s$ becomes $\\mathtt{\\underline{1}0\\underline{010}}$.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of operations required to change all characters in $s$ to $\\mathtt{0}$.\n\nRecall that for a string $s = s_1s_2\\ldots s_n$, any string $t=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\\ldots s_{i_k}$ ($k\\ge 1$) where $1\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots <i_k\\leq n$ is a subsequence of $s$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of input test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains the string $s$ ($1\\le |s|\\le 50$), where $|s|$ represents the length of $s$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to change all characters in $s$ to $\\mathtt{0}$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1\n\n000\n\n1001\n\n10101\n\n01100101011101\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n0\n2\n3\n8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can flip $s_1$. Then $s$ becomes $\\mathtt{0}$, so the answer is $1$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, you can perform the following three operations in order:\n\n1. Flip $s_1s_2s_3s_4s_5$. Then $s$ becomes $\\mathtt{\\underline{01010}}$.\n2. Flip $s_2s_3s_4$. Then $s$ becomes $\\mathtt{0\\underline{010}0}$.\n3. Flip $s_3$. Then $s$ becomes $\\mathtt{00\\underline{0}00}$.\n\nIt can be shown that you can not change all characters in $s$ to $\\mathtt{0}$ in less than three operations, so the answer is $3$.",
