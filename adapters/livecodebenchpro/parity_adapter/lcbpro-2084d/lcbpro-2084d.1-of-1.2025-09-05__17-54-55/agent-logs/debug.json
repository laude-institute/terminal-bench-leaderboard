The commands will be executed in a Docker container.\n\nFor competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:\n1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp\n2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout\n3. Handle multiple test cases if specified\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures\n\nReturn your response in JSON format with two fields:\n\n1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute\n2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do\n\nExample response format:\n\n{\n    \"commands\": [\"cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main() {\\n    // solution code\\n    return 0;\\n}\\nEOF\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"Create C++ solution file\"\n}\n\nDon't include markdown formatting."
