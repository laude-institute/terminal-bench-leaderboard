    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2066F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given two arrays of integers: $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$.\n\nYou need to determine if it is possible to transform array $a$ into array $b$ using the following operation several (possibly, zero) times.\n\n- Among all non-empty subarrays$^{\\text{∗}}$ of $a$, choose any with the maximum sum, and replace this subarray with an arbitrary non-empty integer array.\n\nIf it is possible, you need to construct any possible sequence of operations. Constraint: in your answer, the sum of the lengths of the arrays used as replacements must not exceed $n + m$ across all operations. The numbers must not exceed $10^9$ in absolute value.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$An array $a$ is a subarray of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 200$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 500$) -- the lengths of arrays $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^6 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) -- the elements of array $a$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ ($-10^6 \\le b_i \\le 10^6$) -- the elements of array $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $500$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $m$ across all test cases does not exceed $500$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $-1$ if it is impossible to transform array $a$ into array $b$.\n\nOtherwise, in the first line, output the number of operations $0 \\leq q \\leq n + m$. Then output the operations in the following format in the order they are performed.\n\nIn the first line of each operation, print three numbers $l, r, k$ ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |a|$). In the second line, print $k$ integers $c_1 \\ldots c_k$, which means replacing the segment $a_l, \\ldots, a_r$ with the array $c_1, \\ldots, c_k$.\n\nThe sum of $k$ across all $q$ operations must not exceed $n + m$. Additionally, it must hold that $-10^9 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^9$.\n\nYou do not need to minimize the number of operations.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n4 3\n\n2 -3 2 0\n\n-3 -7 0\n\n2 1\n\n-2 -2\n\n2\n\n5 4\n\n-5 9 -3 5 -9\n\n-6 6 -1 -9\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n3 4 1\n-3\n\n1 1 1\n-3\n\n2 2 1\n-7\n\n3 3 1\n0\n\n-1\n\n3\n2 4 1\n-5\n\n1 1 1\n-6\n\n2 2 2\n6 -1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test, the initial array is modified as follows:\n\n\n\n$$ [2, -3, 2, 0] \\to [2, -3, -3] \\to [-3, -3, -3] \\to [-3, -7, -3] \\to [-3, -7, 0] $$\n\nYou may choose to output empty lines or not. Empty lines in the example are added for convenience.",
