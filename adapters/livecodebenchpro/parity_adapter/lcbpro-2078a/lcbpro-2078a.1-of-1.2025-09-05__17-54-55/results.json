    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2078A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\n[Testify - void (Mournfinale) feat. 星熊南巫](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkUN_9HFNPg)\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of length $n$, and must perform the following operation until the length of $a$ becomes $1$.\n\nChoose a positive integer $k < |a|$ such that $\\frac{|a|}{k}$ is an integer. Split $a$ into $k$ subsequences$^{\\text{∗}}$ $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k$ such that:\n\n- Each element of $a$ belongs to exactly one subsequence.\n- The length of every subsequence is equal.\n\nAfter this, replace $a = \\left[ \\operatorname{avg}(s_1), \\operatorname{avg}(s_2), \\ldots, \\operatorname{avg}(s_k) \\right] $, where $\\operatorname{avg}(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{|s|} s_i}{|s|}$ is the average of all the values in the subsequence. For example, $\\operatorname{avg}([1, 2, 1, 1]) = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n\nYour task is to determine whether there exists a sequence of operations such that after all operations, $a = [x]$.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A sequence $x$ is a subsequence of a sequence $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $x$ ($1 \\leq n, x \\leq 100$) -- the length of the array $a$ and the final desired value.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$) -- the array $a$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES'\" (without quotes) if there exists such a sequence of operations, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n1 3\n\n3\n\n4 9\n\n7 11 2 5\n\n6 9\n\n1 9 14 12 10 8\n\n10 10\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $x = 3$ and $a = [3]$ already holds.\n\nIn the second test case, $x = 9$, and there exists no sequence of operations such that after all operations, $a = [9]$.\n\nIn the third test case, $x = 9$, and here is one possible sequence of operations.\n\n1. $k = 2$, $s_1 = [1, 12, 8]$ and $s_2 = [9, 14, 10]$. Hence, $a = [\\operatorname{avg}(s_1), \\operatorname{avg}(s_2)] = [7, 11]$.\n2. $k = 1$ and $s_1 = [7, 11]$. Hence, $a = [\\operatorname{avg}(s_1)] = [9]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, $x = 10$, and here is one possible sequence of operations.\n\n1. $k = 1$ and $s_1 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$. Hence, $a = [\\operatorname{avg}(s_1)] = [10]$.",
