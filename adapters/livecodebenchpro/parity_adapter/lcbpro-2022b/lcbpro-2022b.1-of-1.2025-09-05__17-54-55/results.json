    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2022B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKarel is a salesman in a car dealership. The dealership has $n$ different models of cars. There are $a_i$ cars of the $i$-th model. Karel is an excellent salesperson and can convince customers to buy up to $x$ cars (of Karel's choice), as long as the cars are from different models.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of customers Karel has to bring in to sell all the cars.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$; $1 \\le x \\le 10$) -- the number of different models of cars and the maximum number of cars Karel can convince a customer to buy.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) -- the number of cars of each model.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum possible number of customers needed to sell all the cars.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3 2\n\n3 1 2\n\n3 3\n\n2 1 3\n\n5 3\n\n2 2 1 9 2\n\n7 4\n\n2 5 3 3 5 2 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n3\n9\n7\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first case, Karel only needs to lure in $3$ customers. He will convince the customers to buy the following models of cars:\n\n- Customer $1$ buys $2$ cars with model $1$ and $3$.\n- Customer $2$ buys $2$ cars with model $1$ and $2$.\n- Customer $3$ buys $2$ cars with model $1$ and $3$.\n\nFor the second case, Karel only needs to lure in $3$ customers. He will convince the customers to buy the following models of cars:\n\n- Customer $1$ buys $2$ cars with model $1$ and $3$.\n- Customer $2$ buys $3$ cars with model $1$, $2$ and $3$.\n- Customer $3$ buys $1$ car with model $3$.",
