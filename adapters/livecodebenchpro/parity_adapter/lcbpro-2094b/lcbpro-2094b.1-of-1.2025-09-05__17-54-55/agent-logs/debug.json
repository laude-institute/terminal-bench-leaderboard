Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2094B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn Bobritto Bandito's home town of residence, there are an infinite number of houses on an infinite number line, with houses at $\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$. On day $0$, he started a plague by giving an infection to the unfortunate residents of house $0$. Each succeeding day, the plague spreads to exactly one healthy household that is next to an infected household. It can be shown that each day the infected houses form a continuous segment.\n\nLet the segment starting at the $l$-th house and ending at the $r$-th house be denoted as $[l, r]$. You know that after $n$ days, the segment $[l, r]$ became infected. Find any such segment $[l', r']$ that could have been infected on the $m$-th day ($m \\le n$).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$)\u00a0-- the number of independent test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $m$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \\leq m\\leq n \\leq 2000, -n \\leq l \\leq 0 \\leq r \\leq n, r-l=n$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output two integers $l'$ and $r'$ on a new line. If there are multiple solutions, output any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n4 2 -2 2\n\n4 1 0 4\n\n3 3 -1 2\n\n9 8 -6 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n-1 1\n0 1\n-1 2\n-5 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it is possible that on the $1$-st, $2$-nd, and $3$-rd days the interval of houses affected is $[-1,0]$, $[-1,1]$, $[-2,1]$. Therefore, $[-1,1]$ is a valid output.\n\nGenerate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.\n\nFor competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:\n1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp\n2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout\n3. Handle multiple test cases if specified\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures\n\nReturn your response in JSON format with two fields:\n\n1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute\n2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do\n\nExample response format:\n\n{\n    \"commands\": [\"cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main() {\\n    // solution code\\n    return 0;\\n}\\nEOF\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"Create C++ solution file\"\n}\n\nDon't include markdown formatting."
