You are an AI assistant that generates shell commands to solve competitive programming tasks in a Docker container.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.

Instruction:
LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
  - PID: problem id (default 2020C)
  - LANG: language (default cpp)
  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

You are given three non-negative integers $b$, $c$, and $d$.

Please find a non-negative integer $a \in [0, 2^{61}]$ such that $(a\, |\, b)-(a\, \&\, c)=d$, where $|$ and $\&$ denote the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) and the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND), respectively.

If such an $a$ exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer $-1$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

### Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three positive integers $b$, $c$, and $d$ ($0 \le b, c, d \le 10^{18}$).

### Output

For each test case, output the value of $a$, or $-1$ if there is no solution. Please note that $a$ must be non-negative and cannot exceed $2^{61}$.

### Example

#### Input #1

```

3

2 2 2

4 2 6

10 2 14

```

#### Output #1

```
0
-1
12
```

### Note

In the first test case, $(0\,|\,2)-(0\,\&\,2)=2-0=2$. So, $a = 0$ is a correct answer.

In the second test case, no value of $a$ satisfies the equation.

In the third test case, $(12\,|\,10)-(12\,\&\,2)=14-0=14$. So, $a = 12$ is a correct answer.

Generate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.

For competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:
1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp
2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout
3. Handle multiple test cases if specified
4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures

Return your response in JSON format with two fields:

1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute
2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do

Example response format:

{
    "commands": ["cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    // solution code\n    return 0;\n}\nEOF"],
    "explanation": "Create C++ solution file"
}
