    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2104C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. They have $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$. At the beginning of the game, some of these cards are given to Alice, and the rest are given to Bob.\n\nCard with number $i$ beats card with number $j$ if and only if $i > j$, with one exception: card $1$ beats card $n$.\n\nThe game continues as long as each player has at least one card. During each turn, the following occurs:\n\n1. Alice chooses one of her cards and places it face up on the table;\n2. Bob, seeing Alice's card, chooses one of his cards and places it face up on the table;\n3. if Alice's card beats Bob's card, both cards are taken by Alice. Otherwise, both cards are taken by Bob.\n\nA player can use a card that they have taken during one of the previous turns.\n\nThe player who has no cards at the beginning of a turn loses. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n- the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$) -- the number of cards;\n- the second line contains $n$ characters, each either A or B. If the $i$-th character is A, then card number $i$ is initially given to Alice; otherwise, it is given to Bob.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one card is initially given to Alice, and at least one card is initially given to Bob.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output Alice if Alice wins with optimal play, or Bob if Bob wins. It can be shown that if both players play optimally, the game will definitely end in a finite number of turns with one of the players winning.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n2\n\nAB\n\n2\n\nBA\n\n4\n\nABAB\n\n4\n\nBABA\n\n3\n\nBAA\n\n5\n\nAAAAB\n\n5\n\nBAAAB\n\n6\n\nBBBAAA\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nAlice\nBob\nBob\nBob\nAlice\nAlice\nBob\nAlice\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Alice has only one card, and Bob has only one card. Since Alice's card beats Bob's card, she wins after the first turn.\n\nIn the second test case, Alice has only one card, and Bob has only one card. Since Bob's card beats Alice's card, he wins after the first turn.\n\nIn the third test case, there are two possible game scenarios:\n\n- if Alice plays the card $1$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $2$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $3$ on the second turn, and Bob will respond by playing the card $4$. Then, he wins;\n- if Alice plays the card $3$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $4$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $1$, and Bob can respond either with the card $2$ or the card $3$. Then, he wins.\n\nIn the fourth test case, there are two possible game scenarios:\n\n- if Alice plays the card $2$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $3$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $4$ on the second turn, and Bob will respond by playing the card $1$. Then, he wins;\n- if Alice plays the card $4$ on the first turn, Bob can respond with the card $1$ and take both cards. Then, Alice has to play the card $2$, and Bob can respond either with the card $3$ or the card $4$. Then, he wins.",
