    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2050A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKostya has a text $s$ consisting of $n$ words made up of Latin alphabet letters. He also has two strips on which he must write the text. The first strip can hold $m$ characters, while the second can hold as many as needed.\n\nKostya must choose a number $x$ and write the first $x$ words from $s$ on the first strip, while all the remaining words are written on the second strip. To save space, the words are written without gaps, but each word must be entirely on one strip.\n\nSince space on the second strip is very valuable, Kostya asks you to choose the maximum possible number $x$ such that all words $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_x$ fit on the first strip of length $m$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$; $1 \\le m \\le 500$) -- the number of words in the list and the maximum number of characters that can be on the first strip.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain one word $s_i$ of lowercase Latin letters, where the length of $s_i$ does not exceed $10$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of words $x$ such that the first $x$ words have a total length of no more than $m$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n2 9\n\nalpha\n\nbeta\n\n4 12\n\nhello\n\nworld\n\nand\n\ncodeforces\n\n3 2\n\nab\n\nc\n\nd\n\n3 2\n\nabc\n\nab\n\na\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n1\n0\n```",
