The current value of $n$ becomes $4 - 4 = 0$.\n\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make $n$ equal to $0$ in less than $2$ operations.

The current value of $n$ becomes $3 - 1 = 2$.\n2. Subtract $5^0 = 1$ from $2$. The current value of $n$ becomes $2 - 1 = 1$.\n3. Subtract $5^0 = 1$ from $1$.

For each test case, it computes the minimum number of operations required to reduce n to zero by repeatedly subtracting powers of k. If k=1, it simply outputs n since only 1 can be subtracted each time. Otherwise, it sums the digits of n in base k representation, which equals the minimum operations.
