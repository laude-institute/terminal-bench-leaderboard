    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2049B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nCats are attracted to pspspsps, but Evirir, being a dignified dragon, is only attracted to pspspsps with oddly specific requirements...\n\nGiven a string $s = s_1s_2\\ldots s_n$ of length $n$ consisting of characters p, s, and . (dot), determine whether a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ of length $n$ exists, such that for all integers $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$):\n\n- If $s_i$ is p, then $[p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_i]$ forms a permutation (of length $i$);\n- If $s_i$ is s, then $[p_i, p_{i+1}, \\ldots, p_{n}]$ forms a permutation (of length $n-i+1$);\n- If $s_i$ is ., then there is no additional restriction.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 500$), the length of $s$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$ that consists of the characters p, s, and ..\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output YES or NO on a line. Output YES if there is such a permutation and NO otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n9\n\n4\n\ns.sp\n\n6\n\npss..s\n\n5\n\nppppp\n\n2\n\nsp\n\n4\n\n.sp.\n\n8\n\npsss....\n\n1\n\n.\n\n8\n\npspspsps\n\n20\n\n....................\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, one permutation that works is $p = [3, 4, 1, 2]$. The restrictions are as follows:\n\n- $s_1 =$ s: $[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [3, 4, 1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n- $s_2 =$ .: No additional restriction.\n- $s_3 =$ s: $[p_3, p_4] = [1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n- $s_4 =$ p: $[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [3, 4, 1, 2]$ forms a permutation.\n\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation that satisfies all restrictions.\n\nFor the third test case, one permutation that satisfies the constraints is $p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$.",
