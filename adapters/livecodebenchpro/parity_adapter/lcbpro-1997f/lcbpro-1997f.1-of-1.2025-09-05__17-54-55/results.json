    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1997F)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou have $n$ chips, and you are going to place all of them in one of $x$ points, numbered from $1$ to $x$. There can be multiple chips in each point.\n\nAfter placing the chips, you can perform the following four operations (in any order, any number of times):\n\n- choose a chip in point $i \\ge 3$, remove it and place two chips: one in $i-1$, one in $i-2$;\n- choose two chips in adjacent points $i$ and $i+1$, remove them and place a new chip in $i+2$;\n- choose a chip in point $1$ and move it to $2$;\n- choose a chip in point $2$ and move it to $1$.\n\nNote that the coordinates of the chips you place during the operations cannot be less than $1$, but can be greater than $x$.\n\nDenote the cost of chip placement as the minimum number of chips which can be present on the line after you perform these operations, starting from the placement you've chosen.\n\nFor example, the cost of placing two chips in points $3$ and one chip in point $5$ is $2$, because you can reduce the number of chips to $2$ as follows:\n\n- choose a chip in point $3$, remove it, place a chip in $1$ and another chip in $2$;\n- choose the chips in points $2$ and $3$, remove them and place a chip in $4$;\n- choose the chips in points $4$ and $5$, remove them and place a chip in $6$.\n\nYou are given three integers $n$, $x$ and $m$. Calculate the number of placements of exactly $n$ chips in points from $1$ to $x$ having cost equal to $m$, and print it modulo $998244353$. Two placements are considered different if the number of chips in some point differs between these placements.\n\n### Input\n\nThe only line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le n \\le 1000$; $2 \\le x \\le 10$).\n\n### Output\n\nPrint one integer -- the number of placements with cost equal to $m$, taken modulo $998244353$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2 3 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n42 10 5\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n902673363\n```\n\n#### Input #3\n\n```\n\n1000 10 8\n\n```\n\n#### Output #3\n\n```\n187821763\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, there are five ways to place $2$ chips in points from $1$ to $3$ so that the cost is $1$:\n\n- $(1, 1)$;\n- $(1, 2)$;\n- $(1, 3)$;\n- $(2, 2)$;\n- $(2, 3)$.",
