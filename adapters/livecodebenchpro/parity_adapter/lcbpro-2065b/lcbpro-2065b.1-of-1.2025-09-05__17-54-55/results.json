    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2065B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSkibidus is given a string $s$ that consists of lowercase Latin letters. If $s$ contains more than $1$ letter, he can:\n\n- Choose an index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq |s| - 1$, $|s|$ denotes the current length of $s$) such that $s_i = s_{i+1}$. Replace $s_i$ with any lowercase Latin letter of his choice. Remove $s_{i+1}$ from the string.\n\nSkibidus must determine the minimum possible length he can achieve through any number of operations.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a string $s$ ($1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$). It is guaranteed $s$ only contains lowercase Latin letters.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output an integer on the new line, the minimum achievable length of $s$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\nbaa\n\nskibidus\n\ncc\n\nohio\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n8\n1\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Skibidus can:\n\n- Perform an operation on $i = 2$. He replaces $s_2$ with b and removes $s_3$ from the string. Then, $s$ becomes bb.\n- Perform an operation on $i = 1$. He replaces $s_1$ with b and removes $s_2$ from the string. Then, $s$ becomes b.\n- Because $s$ only contains $1$ letter, Skibidus cannot perform any more operations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $1$ for the first test case.\n\nIn the second test case, he cannot perform an operation on any index. Therefore, the answer is still the length of the initial string, $8$.",
