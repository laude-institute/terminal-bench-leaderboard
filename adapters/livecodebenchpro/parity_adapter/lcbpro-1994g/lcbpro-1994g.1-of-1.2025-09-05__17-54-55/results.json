    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1994G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nAfter winning another Bed Wars game, Masha and Olya wanted to relax and decided to play a new game. Masha gives Olya an array $a$ of length $n$ and a number $s$. Now Olya's task is to find a non-negative number $x$ such that $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\oplus x = s$. But she is very tired after a tight round, so please help her with this.\n\nBut this task seemed too simple to them, so they decided to make the numbers larger (up to $2^k$) and provide you with their binary representation.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k, n \\cdot k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$) -- the length of the array $a$ and the length of the binary representation of all numbers.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length $k$, consisting of zeros and ones -- the binary representation of the number $s$, starting from the most significant bits.\n\nThe next $n$ lines also contain strings of length $k$, consisting of zeros and ones, the $i$-th of these strings contains the binary representation of the number $a_i$, starting from the most significant bits.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n \\cdot k$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a string of length $k$ on a separate line, consisting of zeros or ones -- the binary representation of any suitable number $x$ ($x \\ge 0$), starting from the most significant bits, or $-1$ if such $x$ does not exist.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n4 5\n\n01011\n\n01110\n\n00110\n\n01100\n\n01111\n\n2 8\n\n00101001\n\n10111111\n\n10011110\n\n5 4\n\n0101\n\n0010\n\n0000\n\n0000\n\n0010\n\n0011\n\n6 5\n\n00011\n\n10110\n\n11001\n\n01010\n\n11100\n\n10011\n\n10000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n01110\n10011010\n0010\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $s = 11, a = [14, 6, 12, 15]$, if $x = 14$, then $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\oplus x = (14 \\oplus 14) + (6 \\oplus 14) + (12 \\oplus 14) + (15 \\oplus 14) = 0 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 = s$.\n\nIn the second test case, $s = 41, a = [191, 158]$, if $x = 154$, then $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\oplus x = (191 \\oplus 154) + (158 \\oplus 154) = 37 + 4 = 41 = s$.",
