    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2018E2)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\n[Ken Arai - COMPLEX](https://soundcloud.com/diatomichail2/complex)\n\n⠀\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. In this version, the constraints on $n$ and the time limit are higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nA set of (closed) segments is complex if it can be partitioned into some subsets such that\n\n- all the subsets have the same size; and\n- a pair of segments intersects if and only if the two segments are in the same subset.\n\nYou are given $n$ segments $[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_n, r_n]$. Find the maximum size of a complex subset of these segments.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of segments.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le 2n$) -- the left endpoints of the segments.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$ ($l_i \\leq r_i \\le 2n$) -- the right endpoints of the segments.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum size of a complex subset of the given segments.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n5 4 6\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 6 8\n\n5 4 7 9 10\n\n5\n\n3 1 4 1 5\n\n7 2 6 5 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n4\n4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, all pairs of segments intersect, therefore it is optimal to form a single group containing all of the three segments.\n\nIn the second test case, there is no valid partition for all of the five segments. A valid partition with four segments is the following: $\\{\\{ [1, 5], [2, 4] \\}, \\{ [6, 9], [8, 10] \\}\\}$.\n\nIn the third test case, it is optimal to make a single group containing all the segments except the second.",
