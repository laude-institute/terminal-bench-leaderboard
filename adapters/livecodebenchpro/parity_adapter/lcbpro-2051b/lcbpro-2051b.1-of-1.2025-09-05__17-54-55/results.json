    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2051B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMonocarp decided to embark on a long hiking journey.\n\nHe decided that on the first day he would walk $a$ kilometers, on the second day he would walk $b$ kilometers, on the third day he would walk $c$ kilometers, on the fourth day, just like on the first, he would walk $a$ kilometers, on the fifth day, just like on the second, he would walk $b$ kilometers, on the sixth day, just like on the third, he would walk $c$ kilometers, and so on.\n\nMonocarp will complete his journey on the day when he has walked at least $n$ kilometers in total. Your task is to determine the day on which Monocarp will complete his journey.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing four integers $n$, $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$; $1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^6$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output one integer -- the day on which Monocarp will have walked at least $n$ kilometers in total and will complete his journey.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n12 1 5 3\n\n6 6 7 4\n\n16 3 4 1\n\n1000000000 1 1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n1\n6\n1000000000\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, over the first four days, Monocarp will cover $1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 10$ kilometers. On the fifth day, he will cover another $5$ kilometers, meaning that in total over five days he will have covered $10 + 5 = 15$ kilometers. Since $n = 12$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the fifth day.\n\nIn the second example, Monocarp will cover $6$ kilometers on the first day. Since $n = 6$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the very first day.\n\nIn the third example, Monocarp will cover $3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 16$ kilometers over the first six days. Since $n = 16$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the sixth day.",
