Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2039C1)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are highlighted in bold. You can only make hacks if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nShohag has two integers $x$ and $m$. Help him count the number of integers $1 \\le y \\le m$ such that $\\mathbf{x \\neq y}$ and $x \\oplus y$ is a divisor$^{\\text{∗}}$ of either $x$, $y$, or both. Here $\\oplus$ is the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operator.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The number $b$ is a divisor of the number $a$ if there exists an integer $c$ such that $a = b \\cdot c$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $m$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$, $1 \\le m \\le 10^{18}$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the number of suitable $y$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n6 9\n\n5 7\n\n2 3\n\n6 4\n\n4 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n3\n2\n1\n1\n0\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, for $x = 6$, there are $3$ valid values for $y$ among the integers from $1$ to $m = 9$, and they are $4$, $5$, and $7$.\n\n- $y = 4$ is valid because $x \\oplus y = 6 \\oplus 4 = 2$ and $2$ is a divisor of both $x = 6$ and $y = 4$.\n- $y = 5$ is valid because $x \\oplus y = 6 \\oplus 5 = 3$ and $3$ is a divisor of $x = 6$.\n- $y = 7$ is valid because $x \\oplus y = 6 \\oplus 7 = 1$ and $1$ is a divisor of both $x = 6$ and $y = 7$.\n\nIn the second test case, for $x = 5$, there are $2$ valid values for $y$ among the integers from $1$ to $m = 7$, and they are $4$ and $6$.\n\n- $y = 4$ is valid because $x \\oplus y = 5 \\oplus 4 = 1$ and $1$ is a divisor of both $x = 5$ and $y = 4$.\n- $y = 6$ is valid because $x \\oplus y = 5 \\oplus 6 = 3$ and $3$ is a divisor of $y = 6$.",
