    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1995C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nikrpprpp found an array $a$ consisting of integers. He likes justice, so he wants to make $a$ fair -- that is, make it non-decreasing. To do that, he can perform an act of justice on an index $1 \\le i \\le n$ of the array, which will replace $a_i$ with $a_i ^ 2$ (the element at position $i$ with its square). For example, if $a = [2,4,3,3,5,3]$ and ikrpprpp chooses to perform an act of justice on $i = 4$, $a$ becomes $[2,4,3,9,5,3]$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of acts of justice needed to make the array non-decreasing?\n\n### Input\n\nFirst line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) -- the number of test cases. It is followed by the description of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer $n$ -- size of the array $a$. The second line contains $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10 ^5$) integers $a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10 ^ 6$).\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot {10}^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each testcase, print an integer -- minimum number of acts of justice required to make the array $a$ non-decreasing. If it is impossible to do that, print $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n7\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n2\n\n3 2\n\n3\n\n3 1 5\n\n4\n\n1 1 2 3\n\n3\n\n4 3 2\n\n9\n\n16 2 4 2 256 2 4 2 8\n\n11\n\n10010 10009 10008 10007 10006 10005 10004 10003 10002 10001 10000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n1\n-1\n0\n3\n15\n55\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, there's no need to perform acts of justice. The array is fair on its own!\n\nIn the third test case, it can be proven that the array cannot become non-decreasing.\n\nIn the fifth test case, ikrpprppp can perform an act of justice on index 3, then an act of justice on index 2, and finally yet another act of justice on index 3. After that, $a$ will become $[4, 9, 16]$.",
