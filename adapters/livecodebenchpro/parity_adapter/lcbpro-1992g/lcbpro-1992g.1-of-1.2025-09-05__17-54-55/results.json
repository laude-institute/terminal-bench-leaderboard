    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1992G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nK1o0n gave you an array $a$ of length $n$, consisting of numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Accept it? Of course! But what to do with it? Of course, calculate $\\text{MEOW}(a)$.\n\nLet $\\text{MEX}(S, k)$ be the $k$-th positive (strictly greater than zero) integer in ascending order that is not present in the set $S$. Denote $\\text{MEOW}(a)$ as the sum of $\\text{MEX}(b, |b| + 1)$, over all distinct subsets $b$ of the array $a$.\n\nExamples of $\\text{MEX}(S, k)$ values for sets:\n\n- $\\text{MEX}(\\{3,2\\}, 1) = 1$, because $1$ is the first positive integer not present in the set;\n- $\\text{MEX}(\\{4,2,1\\}, 2) = 5$, because the first two positive integers not present in the set are $3$ and $5$;\n- $\\text{MEX}(\\{\\}, 4) = 4$, because there are no numbers in the empty set, so the first $4$ positive integers not present in it are $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nIn a single line of each test case, an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000$) is entered, the size of the array of gifted numbers.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $25 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single number -- $\\text{MEOW}(a)$. Since it may be very large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4999\n\n5\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n12\n31\n354226409\n184\n4\n```",
