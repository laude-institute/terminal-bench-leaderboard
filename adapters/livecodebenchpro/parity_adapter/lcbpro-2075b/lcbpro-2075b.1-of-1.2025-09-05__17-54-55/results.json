    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2075B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given an integer array $a$ of size $n$. Initially, all elements of the array are colored red.\n\nYou have to choose exactly $k$ elements of the array and paint them blue. Then, while there is at least one red element, you have to select any red element with a blue neighbor and make it blue.\n\nThe cost of painting the array is defined as the sum of the first $k$ chosen elements and the last painted element.\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of painting for the given array.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 5000$; $1 \\le k < n$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the maximum possible cost of painting for the given array.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n3 1\n\n1 2 3\n\n5 2\n\n4 2 3 1 3\n\n4 3\n\n2 2 2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n5\n10\n8\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, you can initially color the $2$-nd element, and then color the elements in the order $1, 3$. Then the cost of painting is equal to $2+3=5$.\n\nIn the second example, you can initially color the elements $1$ and $5$, and then color the elements in the order $2, 4, 3$. Then the cost of painting is equal to $4+3+3=10$.\n\nIn the third example, you can initially color the elements $2, 3, 4$, and then color the $1$-st element. Then the cost of painting is equal to $2+2+2+2=8$.",
