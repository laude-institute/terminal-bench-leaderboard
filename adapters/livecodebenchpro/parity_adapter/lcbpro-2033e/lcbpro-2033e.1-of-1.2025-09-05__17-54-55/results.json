    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2033E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nSakurako's exams are over, and she did excellently. As a reward, she received a permutation $p$. Kosuke was not entirely satisfied because he failed one exam and did not receive a gift. He decided to sneak into her room (thanks to the code for her lock) and spoil the permutation so that it becomes simple.\n\nA permutation $p$ is considered simple if for every $i$ $(1\\le i \\le n)$ one of the following conditions holds:\n\n- $p_i=i$\n- $p_{p_i}=i$\n\nFor example, the permutations $[1, 2, 3, 4]$, $[5, 2, 4, 3, 1]$, and $[2, 1]$ are simple, while $[2, 3, 1]$ and $[5, 2, 1, 4, 3]$ are not.\n\nIn one operation, Kosuke can choose indices $i,j$ $(1\\le i,j\\le n)$ and swap the elements $p_i$ and $p_j$.\n\nSakurako is about to return home. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by two lines.\n\n- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1\\le n \\le 10^6$) -- the length of the permutation $p$.\n- The second line contains $n$ integers $p_i$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$) -- the elements of the permutation $p$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $p$ is a permutation.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n5\n\n2 3 4 5 1\n\n4\n\n2 3 4 1\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n7\n\n2 3 1 5 6 7 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n0\n2\n1\n0\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first and second examples, the permutations are already simple.\n\nIn the fourth example, it is sufficient to swap $p_2$ and $p_4$. Thus, the permutation will become $[2, 1, 4, 3]$ in $1$ operation.",
