Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2063D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nEven Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.\n\nThere are $n+m$ distinct points $(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \\ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \\ldots, (b_{m},2)$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $0$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose three distinct points which are not [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity);\n- Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;\n- Then, erase the three points from the plane.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5f6a73286fffbc2708f1d388ed58ca5bc0d69d23.png)An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice.\n\nLet $k_{\\max}$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $k_\\max$ is $0$. Additionally, define $f(k)$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $k$ times. Here, $f(k)$ is defined for all integers $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le k_{\\max}$.\n\nFind the value of $k_{\\max}$, and find the values of $f(x)$ for all integers $x=1,2,\\ldots,k_{\\max}$ independently.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le {3 \\cdot 10^4}$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n}$ -- the points on $y=0$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ pairwise distinct integers $b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_{m}$ -- the points on $y=2$ ($-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $k_{\\max}$, you must output at most two lines:\n\n- The first line contains the value of $k_{\\max}$;\n- The second line contains $k_{\\max}$ integers denoting $f(1),f(2),\\ldots,f(k_{\\max})$. You are allowed to omit this line if $k_{\\max}$ is $0$.\n\nNote that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $f(x)$ are integers no greater than $10^{16}$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1 3\n\n0\n\n0 1 -1\n\n2 4\n\n0 100\n\n-100 -50 0 50\n\n2 4\n\n0 1000\n\n-100 -50 0 50\n\n6 6\n\n20 1 27 100 43 42\n\n100 84 1 24 22 77\n\n8 2\n\n564040265 -509489796 469913620 198872582 -400714529 553177666 131159391 -20796763\n\n-1000000000 1000000000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n150 200\n2\n1000 200\n4\n99 198 260 283\n2\n2000000000 2027422256\n```\n\n### Note\n\nOn the first test case, there are $1+3=4$ points $(0,0),(0,2),(1,2),(-1,2)$.\n\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform two or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $1$, and you are only asked for the value of $f(1)$.\n\nYou can choose $(0,0)$, $(-1,2)$, and $(1,2)$ as the three vertices of the triangle. After that, your score is increased by the area of the triangle, which is $2$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2$.\n\nOn the fifth test case, there are $8+2=10$ points.\n\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform three or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $2$, and you are asked for the values $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\n\nTo maximize the score with only one operation, you can choose three points $(198\\,872\\,582,0)$, $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$.\n\nTo maximize the score with exactly two operations, you can choose the following sequence of operations.\n\n- Choose three points $(-509\\,489\\,796,0)$, $(553\\,177\\,666,0)$, and $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased.\n- Choose three points $(-400\\,714\\,529,0)$, $(564\\,040\\,265,0)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased.\n\nThen, the score after two operations becomes $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing exactly two operations is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$.",
