    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2112E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nConsider a rooted undirected tree. Each vertex can be colored blue, green, or yellow. A coloring is called beautiful if it meets these conditions:\n\n- the root of the tree is green;\n- if you consider all blue and green vertices, they are reachable from each other without passing through any yellow vertices;\n- if you consider all yellow and green vertices, they are reachable from each other without passing through any blue vertices;\n\nYou are given an integer $m$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly $m$ beautiful colorings.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly $m$ beautiful colorings. If such a tree does not exist, print $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\n9\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the following notes, let $g$ describe green color, $b$ be blue, and $y$ be yellow.\n\nIn the first example, consider a simple tree with just $1$ vertex. This tree has exactly $1$ beautiful coloring: the root is green.\n\nIn the second example, consider a simple tree with $2$ vertices with a root at the $1$-st vertex. There are exactly $3$ beautiful colorings: $[g, g]$, $[g, b]$ and $[g, y]$.\n\nIn the third example, consider a bamboo tree with $3$ vertices with a root at the $1$-st vertex. There are exactly $5$ beautiful colorings: $[g, g, g]$, $[g, g, b]$, $[g, g, y]$, $[g, b, b]$ and $[g, y, y]$.\n\nIn the fifth example, consider a tree with $3$ vertices with a root at the $1$-st vertex, and the other $2$ vertices connected to it. There are exactly $9$ beautiful colorings: $[g, g, g]$, $[g, g, b]$, $[g, g, y]$, $[g, b, g]$, $[g, b, b]$, $[g, b, y]$, $[g, y, g]$, $[g, y, b]$ and $[g, y, y]$.",
