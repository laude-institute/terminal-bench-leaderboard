    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1994B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nVova really loves the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation (denoted as $\\oplus$). Recently, when he was going to sleep, he came up with a fun game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Vova chooses two binary sequences $s$ and $t$ of length $n$ and gives them to Vanya. A binary sequence is a sequence consisting only of the numbers $0$ and $1$. Vanya can choose integers $l, r$ such that $1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$, and for all $l \\leq i \\leq r$ simultaneously replace $s_i$ with $s_i \\oplus s_{i - l + 1}$, where $s_i$ is the $i$-th element of the sequence $s$.\n\nIn order for the game to be interesting, there must be a possibility to win. Vanya wins if, with an unlimited number of actions, he can obtain the sequence $t$ from the sequence $s$. Determine if the game will be interesting for the sequences $s$ and $t$.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^{4}$) -- the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the sequences $s$ and $t$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary sequence $s$ of length $n$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a binary sequence $t$ of length $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if the game will be interesting, otherwise output \"No\".\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n7\n\n0110100\n\n0110100\n\n9\n\n100101010\n\n101111110\n\n4\n\n0011\n\n1011\n\n4\n\n0100\n\n0001\n\n8\n\n10110111\n\n01100000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, Vanya will not be able to change the sequence $s$ with the only possible action of choosing $l = r = 1$.\n\nIn the second test case, the sequences $s$ and $t$ are already equal.\n\nIn the third test case, Vanya can act as follows:\n\n1. Choose $l = 3$ and $r = 5$, then $s$ will become $\\mathtt{101101010}$.\n2. Choose $l = 5$ and $r = 6$, then $s$ will become $\\mathtt{101111010}$.\n3. Choose $l = 7$ and $r = 7$, then $s$ will become $\\mathtt{101111110}$.",
