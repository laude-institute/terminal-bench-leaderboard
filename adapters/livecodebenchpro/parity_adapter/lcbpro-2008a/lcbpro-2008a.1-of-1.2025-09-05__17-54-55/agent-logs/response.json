    "explanation": "Create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp that reads the number of test cases and for each test case reads integers a and b. The program checks if it's possible to assign '+' or '-' signs to an array of a ones and b twos so that their sum is zero. It uses a simple combinational check by trying to find non-negative integers x and y such that x + 2y equals half of the total sum, and x <= a, y <= b. Outputs \"Yes\" if possible, \"No\" otherwise."
