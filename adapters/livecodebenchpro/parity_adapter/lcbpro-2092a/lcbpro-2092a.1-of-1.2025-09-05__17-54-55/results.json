    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2092A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nKamilka has a flock of $n$ sheep, the $i$-th of which has a beauty level of $a_i$. All $a_i$ are distinct. Morning has come, which means they need to be fed. Kamilka can choose a non-negative integer $d$ and give each sheep $d$ bunches of grass. After that, the beauty level of each sheep increases by $d$.\n\nIn the evening, Kamilka must choose exactly two sheep and take them to the mountains. If the beauty levels of these two sheep are $x$ and $y$ (after they have been fed), then Kamilka's pleasure from the walk is equal to $\\gcd(x, y)$, where $\\gcd(x, y)$ denotes the [greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of integers $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$), the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$), the number of sheep Kamilka has.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\ (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)$ -- the beauty levels of the sheep.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all $a_i$ are distinct.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n5\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n3\n\n5 6 7\n\n3\n\n1 11 10\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n4\n2\n10\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, $d=1$ works. In this case, the pleasure is $\\gcd(1+1, \\ 1+3)=\\gcd(2, \\ 4)=2$. It can be shown that a greater answer cannot be obtained.\n\nIn the second test case, let's take $d=3$. In this case, the pleasure is $\\gcd(1+3, \\ 5+3)=\\gcd(4, \\ 8)=4$. Thus, for this test case, the answer is $4$.",
