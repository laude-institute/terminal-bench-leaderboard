    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2048E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nThe Arms Factory needs a poster design pattern and finds Kevin for help.\n\nA poster design pattern is a bipartite graph with $ 2n $ vertices in the left part and $ m $ vertices in the right part, where there is an edge between each vertex in the left part and each vertex in the right part, resulting in a total of $ 2nm $ edges.\n\nKevin must color each edge with a positive integer in the range $ [1, n] $. A poster design pattern is good if there are no monochromatic cycles$^{\\text{∗}}$ in the bipartite graph.\n\nKevin needs your assistance in constructing a good bipartite graph or informing him if it is impossible.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A monochromatic cycle refers to a simple cycle in which all the edges are colored with the same color.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ($ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $).\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ($ 1 \\le n, m \\leq 10^3 $) -- the bipartite graph has $ 2n $ vertices in the left part and $ m $ vertices in the right part.\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $ n $ and the sum of $ m $ over all test cases do not exceed $ 10^3 $.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, if there is no solution, then output No.\n\nOtherwise, output Yes, and then output $ 2n $ lines, with each line containing $ m $ positive integers. The $ i $-th line's $ j $-th integer represents the color of the edge between the $ i $-th vertex in the left part and the $ j $-th vertex in the right part.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n2 2\n\n3 7\n\n5 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYES\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n2 1\nNO\nYES\n1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 2 3 3\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n```\n\n### Note\n\nFor the first test case, the graph is shown as follows:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/820af5656123195e8f3a7204d13e75d5825110b3.png)\n\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that there is no valid solution.",
