    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1996B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nTina has a square grid with $n$ rows and $n$ columns. Each cell in the grid is either $0$ or $1$.\n\nTina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of $k$ ($k$ is a divisor of $n$). To do this, Tina splits the grid into $k \\times k$ nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block.\n\nTina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block. It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value.\n\nFor example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of $3$.\n\nOriginal grid$0\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n0\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n0\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$0$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$0$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n1\n\n$$0$$\n\n0\n\n$$0$Reduced grid$0$$\n\n1\n\n$$1$$\n\n0$\n\nHelp Tina reduce the grid by a factor of $k$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$, $1 \\le k \\le n$, $k$ is a divisor of $n$) -- the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the factor that Tina wants to reduce the grid by.\n\nEach of the following $n$ lines contain $n$ characters describing the cells of the grid. Each character is either $0$ or $1$. It is guaranteed every $k$ by $k$ block has the same value.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the grid reduced by a factor of $k$ on a new line.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n4 4\n\n0000\n\n0000\n\n0000\n\n0000\n\n6 3\n\n000111\n\n000111\n\n000111\n\n111000\n\n111000\n\n111000\n\n6 2\n\n001100\n\n001100\n\n111111\n\n111111\n\n110000\n\n110000\n\n8 1\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n11111111\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0\n01\n10\n010\n111\n100\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n11111111\n```",
