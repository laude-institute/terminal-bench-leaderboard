If it is impossible, output $-1$.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n6\n\n0001100111\n\n0000011111\n\n010101\n\n111000\n\n0101\n\n0110\n\n0101\n\n1010\n\n011001\n\n001110\n\n0\n\n1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1\n3\n1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n```\n\n#### Input #2\n\n```\n\n6\n\n010101\n\n?0?0??\n\n0101\n\n?0?0\n\n11100101\n\n????????\n\n11100101\n\n???11?1?\n\n1000100011\n\n?11?000?0?\n\n10101\n\n?1011\n\n```\n\n#### Output #2\n\n```\n2\n-1\n0\n2\n2\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case of the first example, the possible way is shown in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case of the first example, one possible way could be:\n\n- Swap blocks $[2, 2], [3, 3]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{001101}$.\n- Swap blocks $[3, 4], [5, 5]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{000111}$.\n- Swap blocks $[1, 3], [4, 6]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{111000}$.\n\nIn the first test case of the second example, one possible way could be:\n\n- Swap blocks $[1, 1], [2, 2]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{100101}$.\n- Swap blocks $[4, 4], [5, 5]$, $s$ will become $\\mathtt{100011}$.\n\nGenerate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.\n\nFor competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:\n1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp\n2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout\n3. Handle multiple test cases if specified\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures\n\nReturn your response in JSON format with two fields:\n\n1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute\n2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do\n\nExample response format:\n\n{\n    \"commands\": [\"cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\nint main() {\\n    // solution code\\n    return 0;\\n}\\nEOF\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"Create C++ solution file\"\n}\n\nDon't include markdown formatting."
