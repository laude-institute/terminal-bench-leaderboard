To test this, Reyhaneh asks [Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi) for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.\n\nNote that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.\n\nAn integer linearly combination of $a_1, \\ldots, a_k$ is any sum of the form $c_1 \\cdot a_1 + c_2 \\cdot a_2 + \\ldots + c_k \\cdot a_k$ where $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$ are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$), the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$), the size of the set. The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$).\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n### Output\n\nIn the first line of each test case print the size of the largest integer linearly independent subset.\n\nIn the next line, print one such subset in any order. If there are multiple valid subsets, print any one of them.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\n12 15 21 30 35\n\n3\n\n2 3 6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n4 6\n3\n35 21 30\n2\n2 3\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn example 1, $\\{4, 6\\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset. It can be proven that there is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $3$ elements.\n\nIn example 2, $\\{35, 21, 30\\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset because no integer linear combination of any two elements can create the third. There is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $4$ elements.\n\nIn example 3, $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is not an integer linearly independent subset since $6$ can be written as $6 \\cdot 2 + (-2) \\cdot 3$, which is an integer linear combination of $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n\nGenerate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task.
