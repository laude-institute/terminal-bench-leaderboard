    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2044D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nGiven a sequence of positive integers, a positive integer is called a mode of the sequence if it occurs the maximum number of times that any positive integer occurs. For example, the mode of $[2,2,3]$ is $2$. Any of $9$, $8$, or $7$ can be considered to be a mode of the sequence $[9,9,8,8,7,7]$.\n\nYou gave UFO an array $a$ of length $n$. To thank you, UFO decides to construct another array $b$ of length $n$ such that $a_i$ is a mode of the sequence $[b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_i]$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nHowever, UFO doesn't know how to construct array $b$, so you must help her. Note that $1 \\leq b_i \\leq n$ must hold for your array for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the length of $a$.\n\nThe following line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ numbers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\leq b_i \\leq n$) on a new line. It can be shown that $b$ can always be constructed. If there are multiple possible arrays, you may print any.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n4\n\n1 1 1 2\n\n8\n\n4 5 5 5 1 1 2 1\n\n10\n\n1 1 2 2 1 1 3 3 1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 2\n1 1 2 2\n4 5 5 1 1 2 2 3\n1 8 2 2 1 3 3 9 1 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's verify the correctness for our sample output in test case $2$.\n\n- At $i = 1$, $1$ is the only possible mode of $[1]$.\n- At $i = 2$, $1$ is the only possible mode of $[1, 1]$.\n- At $i = 3$, $1$ is the only possible mode of $[1, 1, 2]$.\n- At $i = 4$, $1$ or $2$ are both modes of $[1, 1, 2, 2]$. Since $a_i = 2$, this array is valid.",
