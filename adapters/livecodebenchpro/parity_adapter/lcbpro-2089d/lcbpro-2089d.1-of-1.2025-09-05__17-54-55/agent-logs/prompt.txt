You are an AI assistant that generates shell commands to solve competitive programming tasks in a Docker container.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.

Instruction:
LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
  - PID: problem id (default 2089D)
  - LANG: language (default cpp)
  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

In C++, the conditional operator ?: is used as the value of x?y:z is $y$ if $x$ is true; otherwise, the value is $z$. $x$, $y$, and $z$ may also be expressions. It is right-associated; that is, a?b:c?d:e is equivalent to a?b:(c?d:e). $0$ means false and $1$ means true.

Given a binary string with length $2n+1$, you need to show whether the value of the expression can be $1$ after inserting $n$ conditional operators into the string. You can use parentheses. For example, the string 10101 can be transformed into (1?0:1)?0:1, whose value is $1$.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000)$, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

In the first line of each test case, there is a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1.5 \cdot 10^5)$.

In the second line of each test case, there is a binary string of length $2n + 1$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1.5 \cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test case, on the first line, output Yes if the string can be transformed into an expression of value $1$; otherwise, output No.

If the answer is Yes, output the expression on the second line. You can use parentheses, but the order of the characters in the original string must remain the same. The length of your expression must be no more than $10n+1000$.

### Example

#### Input #1

```

2

2

10101

2

00000

```

#### Output #1

```
Yes
(1?0:1)?(0):1
No
```

### Note

The first test case -- is the one mentioned in the problem description.

In the second test case, it is clear that regardless of how the conditional operator is used, the result will always be zero.

Generate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.

For competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:
1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp
2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout
3. Handle multiple test cases if specified
4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures

Return your response in JSON format with two fields:

1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute
2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do

Example response format:

{
    "commands": ["cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    // solution code\n    return 0;\n}\nEOF"],
    "explanation": "Create C++ solution file"
}
