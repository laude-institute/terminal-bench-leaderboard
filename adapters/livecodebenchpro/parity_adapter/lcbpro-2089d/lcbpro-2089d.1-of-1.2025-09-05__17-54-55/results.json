    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2089D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nIn C++, the conditional operator ?: is used as the value of x?y:z is $y$ if $x$ is true; otherwise, the value is $z$. $x$, $y$, and $z$ may also be expressions. It is right-associated; that is, a?b:c?d:e is equivalent to a?b:(c?d:e). $0$ means false and $1$ means true.\n\nGiven a binary string with length $2n+1$, you need to show whether the value of the expression can be $1$ after inserting $n$ conditional operators into the string. You can use parentheses. For example, the string 10101 can be transformed into (1?0:1)?0:1, whose value is $1$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000)$, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, there is a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1.5 \\cdot 10^5)$.\n\nIn the second line of each test case, there is a binary string of length $2n + 1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1.5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, on the first line, output Yes if the string can be transformed into an expression of value $1$; otherwise, output No.\n\nIf the answer is Yes, output the expression on the second line. You can use parentheses, but the order of the characters in the original string must remain the same. The length of your expression must be no more than $10n+1000$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10101\n\n2\n\n00000\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\nYes\n(1?0:1)?(0):1\nNo\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe first test caseÂ -- is the one mentioned in the problem description.\n\nIn the second test case, it is clear that regardless of how the conditional operator is used, the result will always be zero.",
