    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2113A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are the owner of a popular shashlik restaurant, and your grill is the heart of your kitchen. However, the grill has a peculiarity: after cooking each shashlik, its temperature drops.\n\nYou need to cook as many portions of shashlik as possible, and you have an unlimited number of portions of two types available for cooking:\n\n- The first type requires a temperature of at least $a$ degrees at the start of cooking, and after cooking, the grill's temperature decreases by $x$ degrees.\n- The second type requires a temperature of at least $b$ degrees at the start of cooking, and after cooking, the grill's temperature decreases by $y$ degrees.\n\nInitially, the grill's temperature is $k$ degrees. Determine the maximum total number of portions of shashlik that can be cooked.\n\nNote that the grill's temperature can be negative.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains five integers $k$, $a$, $b$, $x$, and $y$ ($1 \\le k, a, b, x, y \\le 10^9$)Â -- the initial temperature of the grill, the required temperature for cooking the first and second types of shashlik, respectively, as well as the temperature drop after cooking the first and second types of shashlik, respectively.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum number of portions of shashlik that you can cook.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n5\n\n10 3 4 2 1\n\n1 10 10 1 1\n\n100 17 5 2 3\n\n28 14 5 2 4\n\n277 5 14 1 3\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n8\n0\n46\n10\n273\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, it is advantageous to cook $7$ portions of the second type of shashlik; after that, the grill's temperature will be $3$ degrees, and we can cook one more portion of the first type of shashlik.\n\nIn the second test case, we cannot cook either type of shashlik because the grill is too cold.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it is advantageous to cook $8$ portions of the first type of shashlik; after that, it will be possible to cook another $2$ portions of the second type of shashlik.",
