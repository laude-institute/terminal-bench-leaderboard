    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2037D)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMualani loves surfing on her sharky surfboard!\n\nMualani's surf path can be modeled by a number line. She starts at position $1$, and the path ends at position $L$. When she is at position $x$ with a jump power of $k$, she can jump to any integer position in the interval $[x, x+k]$. Initially, her jump power is $1$.\n\nHowever, her surf path isn't completely smooth. There are $n$ hurdles on her path. Each hurdle is represented by an interval $[l, r]$, meaning she cannot jump to any position in the interval $[l, r]$.\n\nThere are also $m$ power-ups at certain positions on the path. Power-up $i$ is located at position $x_i$ and has a value of $v_i$. When Mualani is at position $x_i$, she has the option to collect the power-up to increase her jump power by $v_i$. There may be multiple power-ups at the same position. When she is at a position with some power-ups, she may choose to take or ignore each individual power-up. No power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $L$ to finish the path? If it is not possible to finish the surf path, output $-1$.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $L$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 3 \\leq L \\leq 10^9$) -- the number of hurdles, the number of power-ups, and the position of the end.\n\nThe following $n$ lines contain two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($2 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq L-1$) -- the bounds of the interval for the $i$'th hurdle. It is guaranteed that $r_i + 1 < l_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\leq i < n$ (i.e. all hurdles are non-overlapping, sorted by increasing positions, and the end point of a previous hurdle is not consecutive with the start point of the next hurdle).\n\nThe following $m$ lines contain two integers $x_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \\leq x_i, v_i \\leq L$) -- the position and the value for the $i$'th power-up. There may be multiple power-ups with the same $x$. It is guaranteed that $x_i \\leq x_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\leq i < m$ (i.e. the power-ups are sorted by non-decreasing position) and no power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $L$. If it is not possible, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2 5 50\n\n7 14\n\n30 40\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\n3 5\n\n18 2\n\n22 32\n\n4 3 50\n\n4 6\n\n15 18\n\n20 26\n\n34 38\n\n1 2\n\n8 2\n\n10 2\n\n1 4 17\n\n10 14\n\n1 6\n\n1 2\n\n1 2\n\n16 9\n\n1 2 10\n\n5 9\n\n2 3\n\n2 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n-1\n1\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case, she can collect power-ups $1$, $2$, $3$, and $5$ to clear all hurdles.\n\nIn the second test case, she cannot jump over the first hurdle.\n\nIn the fourth test case, by collecting both power-ups, she can jump over the hurdle.",
