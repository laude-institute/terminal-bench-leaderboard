    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2106E)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nWolf has found $n$ sheep with tastiness values $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ where $p$ is a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$. Wolf wants to perform binary search on $p$ to find the sheep with tastiness of $k$, but $p$ may not necessarily be sorted. The success of binary search on the range $[l, r]$ for $k$ is represented as $f(l, r, k)$, which is defined as follows:\n\nIf $l > r$, then $f(l, r, k)$ fails. Otherwise, let $m = \\lfloor\\frac{l + r}{2}\\rfloor$, and:\n\n- If $p_m = k$, then $f(l, r, k)$ is successful,\n- If $p_m < k$, then $f(l, r, k) = f(m+1, r, k)$,\n- If $p_m > k$, then $f(l, r, k) = f(l, m-1, k)$.\n\nCow the Nerd decides to help Wolf out. Cow the Nerd is given $q$ queries, each consisting of three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$. Before the search begins, Cow the Nerd may choose a non-negative integer $d$, and $d$ indices $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_d \\le n$ where $p_{i_j} \\neq k$ over all $1 \\leq j \\leq d$. Then, he may re-order the elements $p_{i_1}, p_{i_2}, ..., p_{i_d}$ however he likes.\n\nFor each query, output the minimum integer $d$ that Cow the Nerd must choose so that $f(l, r, k)$ can be successful, or report that it is impossible. Note that the queries are independent and the reordering is not actually performed.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array that contains every integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$ -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test contains two integers $n$ and $q$ $(1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ -- the length of $p$ and the number of queries respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ -- the tastiness of the $i$-th sheep. It is guaranteed that every integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once in $p$.\n\nThe following $q$ lines contain three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$ $(1 \\le l \\le r \\le n, 1 \\le k \\le n)$ -- the range that the binary search will be performed on and the integer being searched for each query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $q$ over all cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, output the minimum integer $d$ that Cow the Nerd must choose so that $f(l, r, k)$ is successful on a new line. If it is impossible, output $-1$.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n8\n\n5 3\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n1 5 4\n\n1 3 4\n\n3 4 4\n\n7 4\n\n3 1 5 2 7 6 4\n\n3 4 2\n\n2 3 5\n\n1 5 6\n\n1 7 3\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n1 2 1\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\n1 1 1\n\n7 1\n\n3 4 2 5 7 1 6\n\n1 7 1\n\n16 1\n\n16 10 12 6 13 9 14 3 8 11 15 2 7 1 5 4\n\n1 16 4\n\n16 1\n\n14 1 3 15 4 5 6 16 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 2\n\n1 16 14\n\n13 1\n\n12 13 10 9 8 4 11 5 7 6 2 1 3\n\n1 13 2\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n0 -1 0\n2 0 -1 4\n-1\n0\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first example, second query: Since $4$ does not exist in the first three elements, it is impossible to find it when searching for it in that range.\n\nIn the second example, on the first query, you may choose the indices $2$, $3$, and swap them so $p = [3, 5, 1, 2, 7, 6, 4]$. Then, $f(3, 4, 2)$ will work as follows:\n\n1. Let $m = \\lfloor \\frac{3 + 4}{2} \\rfloor = 3$. Because $p_3 = 1 < 2$, then $f(3, 4, 2) = f(4, 4, 2)$.\n2. Let $m = \\lfloor \\frac{4 + 4}{2} \\rfloor = 4$. Because $p_4 = 2 = k$, then $f(4, 4, 2)$ is successful. Therefore, $f(3, 4, 2)$ is also successful.\n\nThe total indices chosen were $2$, so the final cost is $2$, which can be shown that is minimum. Note that for this query we can't choose index $4$, since $p_4 = k = 2$.\n\nIn the last query of the second example, we can choose indices $2, 3, 4, 5$ and re-arrange them so $p = [3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4]$. Then, $f(1, 7, 3)$ is successful.",
