    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2117B)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nA shrink operation on an array $a$ of size $m$ is defined as follows:\n\n- Choose an index $i$ ($2 \\le i \\le m - 1$) such that $a_i \\gt a_{i - 1}$ and $a_i \\gt a_{i + 1}$.\n- Remove $a_i$ from the array.\n\nDefine the score of a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ as the maximum number of times that you can perform the shrink operation on $p$.\n\nYousef has given you a single integer $n$. Construct a permutation $p$ of length $n$ with the maximum possible score. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the size of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output any permutation $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ that maximizes the number of shrink operations.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n1 3 2\n2 3 6 4 5 1\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n- We choose $p = [1, 3, 2]$.\n- Choose index $2$, and remove $p_2$ from the array. The array becomes $p = [1, 2]$.\n\nIt can be shown that the maximum number of operations we can perform is $1$. Another valid answer is $p = [2, 3, 1]$.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n- We choose $p = [2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 1]$.\n- Choose index $5$, and remove $p_5$ from the array. The array becomes $p = [2, 3, 6, 4, 1]$.\n- Choose index $3$, and remove $p_3$ from the array. The array becomes $p = [2, 3, 4, 1]$.\n- Choose index $3$, and remove $p_3$ from the array. The array becomes $p = [2, 3, 1]$.\n- Choose index $2$, and remove $p_2$ from the array. The array becomes $p = [2, 1]$.\n\nThe maximum number of operations we can perform is $4$. Any permutation with a score of $4$ is valid.",
