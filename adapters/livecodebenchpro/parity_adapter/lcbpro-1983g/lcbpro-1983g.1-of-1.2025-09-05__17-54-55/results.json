    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 1983G)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nYou are given a tree with $n$ nodes numbered from $1$ to $n$, along with an array of size $n$. The value of $i$-th node is $a_{i}$. There are $q$ queries. In each query, you are given 2 nodes numbered as $x$ and $y$.\n\nConsider the path from the node numbered as $x$ to the node numbered as $y$. Let the path be represented by $x = p_0, p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_r = y$, where $p_i$ are the intermediate nodes. Compute the sum of $a_{p_i}\\oplus i$ for each $i$ such that $0 \\le i \\le r$ where $\\oplus$ is the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) operator.\n\nMore formally, compute\n\n$$\\sum_{i =0}^{r} a_{p_i}\\oplus i$$\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. Each test case contains several sets of input data.\n\nThe first line of each set of input data contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$) -- the number of nodes.\n\nThe next $n-1$ lines of each set of input data contain $2$ integers, $u$ and $v$ representing an edge between the node numbered $u$ and the node numbered $v$. It is guaranteed that $u \\ne v$ and that the edges form a tree.\n\nThe next line of each set of input data contains $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$) -- values of the nodes.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^5$) -- the number of queries.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query contains $2$ integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\le x,y \\le n$) denoting the starting and the ending node of the path.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$ and sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each query, output a single number -- the sum from the problem statement.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n2 3 6 5\n\n3\n\n1 4\n\n3 4\n\n1 1\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n14\n10\n2\n```",
