You are an AI assistant that generates shell commands to solve competitive programming tasks in a Docker container.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.

Instruction:
LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
  - PID: problem id (default 2070C)
  - LANG: language (default cpp)
  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

You are given a strip, consisting of $n$ cells, all cells are initially colored red.

In one operation, you can choose a segment of consecutive cells and paint them blue. Before painting, the chosen cells can be either red or blue. Note that it is not possible to paint them red. You are allowed to perform at most $k$ operations (possibly zero).

For each cell, the desired color after all operations is specified: red or blue.

It is clear that it is not always possible to satisfy all requirements within $k$ operations. Therefore, for each cell, a penalty is also specified, which is applied if the cell ends up the wrong color after all operations. For the $i$-th cell, the penalty is equal to $a_i$.

The penalty of the final painting is calculated as the maximum penalty among all cells that are painted the wrong color. If there are no such cells, the painting penalty is equal to $0$.

What is the minimum penalty of the final painting that can be achieved?

### Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$; $0 \le k \le n$) -- the length of the strip and the maximum number of operations.

The second line contains a string $s$, consisting of $n$ characters 'R' and/or 'B'. 'R' means that the cell should be painted red. 'B' means that the cell should be painted blue.

The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) -- the penalty for each cell.

The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum penalty of the final painting.

### Example

#### Input #1

```

5

4 1

BRBR

9 3 5 4

4 1

BRBR

9 5 3 4

4 2

BRBR

9 3 5 4

10 2

BRBRBBRRBR

5 1 2 4 5 3 6 1 5 4

5 5

RRRRR

5 3 1 2 4

```

#### Output #1

```
3
3
0
4
0
```

### Note

In the first test case, you can paint the cells from $1$ to $3$. The painting will be BBBR. So, only cell $2$ is painted the wrong color. Therefore, the penalty for it is the final penalty and equals $3$.

In the second test case, the painting BBBR will now result in a penalty of $5$. However, if you paint the cells from $1$ to $1$, resulting in BRRR, then only cell $3$ is painted the wrong color. The final penalty is $3$.

In the third test case, you can paint the cells from $1$ to $1$ and from $3$ to $3$. Then all cells will be the correct color, the penalty equals $0$.

Generate a sequence of shell commands that will solve this competitive programming task. The commands will be executed in a Docker container.

For competitive programming tasks, you typically need to:
1. Create a C++ source file at /app/main.cpp
2. The solution should read from stdin and write to stdout
3. Handle multiple test cases if specified
4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures

Return your response in JSON format with two fields:

1. commands: A list of shell commands to execute
2. explanation: A brief explanation of what the commands will do

Example response format:

{
    "commands": ["cat > /app/main.cpp << 'EOF'\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    // solution code\n    return 0;\n}\nEOF"],
    "explanation": "Create C++ solution file"
}
