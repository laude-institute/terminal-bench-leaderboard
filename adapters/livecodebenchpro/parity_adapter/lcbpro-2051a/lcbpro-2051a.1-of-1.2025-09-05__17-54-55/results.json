    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2051A)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nMonocarp and Stereocarp are preparing for the Olympiad. There are $n$ days left until the Olympiad. On the $i$-th day, if Monocarp plans to practice, he will solve $a_i$ problems. Similarly, if Stereocarp plans to practice on the same day, he will solve $b_i$ problems.\n\nMonocarp can train on any day he wants. However, Stereocarp watches Monocarp and follows a different schedule: if Monocarp trained on day $i$ and $i < n$, then Stereocarp will train on day $(i+1)$.\n\nMonocarp wants to organize his training process in a way that the difference between the number of problems he solves and the number of problems Stereocarp solves is as large as possible. Formally, Monocarp wants to maximize the value of $(m-s)$, where $m$ is the number of problems he solves, and $s$ is the number of problems Stereocarp solves. Help Monocarp determine the maximum possible difference in the number of solved problems between them.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) -- the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$).\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 100$).\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer -- the maximum possible difference between the number of problems Monocarp solves and the number of problems Stereocarp solves.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3 2\n\n2 1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n8\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 2\n\n6\n\n8 2 5 6 2 6\n\n8 2 7 4 3 4\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n4\n5\n1\n16\n```\n\n### Note\n\nLet's analyze the example from the statement:\n\n- In the first test case, it is optimal for Monocarp to train both days; then Stereocarp will train on day $2$.\n- In the second test case, it is optimal for Monocarp to train on the only day, and Stereocarp will not train at all.\n- In the third test case, it is optimal for Monocarp to train on the last day (and only on that day).\n- In the fourth test case, it is optimal for Monocarp to train on days $1, 3, 4, 6$; then Stereocarp will train on days $2, 4, 5$.",
