    "instruction": "LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.\n\nThe agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.\nThis task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:\n  1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,\n  2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == \"done\",\n  3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.\n\nEnvironment variables (overridable at runtime):\n  - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)\n  - PID: problem id (default 2022C)\n  - LANG: language (default cpp)\n  - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)\n  - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)\n\nWe all steal a little bit. But I have only one hand, while my adversaries have two.\n\nÁlvaro Obregón\n\nÁlvaro and José are the only candidates running for the presidency of Tepito, a rectangular grid of $2$ rows and $n$ columns, where each cell represents a house. It is guaranteed that $n$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nUnder the voting system of Tepito, the grid will be split into districts, which consist of any $3$ houses that are connected$^{\\text{∗}}$. Each house will belong to exactly one district.\n\nEach district will cast a single vote. The district will vote for Álvaro or José respectively if at least $2$ houses in that district select them. Therefore, a total of $\\frac{2n}{3}$ votes will be cast.\n\nAs Álvaro is the current president, he knows exactly which candidate each house will select. If Álvaro divides the houses into districts optimally, determine the maximum number of votes he can get.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A set of cells is connected if there is a path between any $2$ cells that requires moving only up, down, left and right through cells in the set.\n\n### Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^5$; $n$ is a multiple of $3$) -- the number of columns of Tepito.\n\nThe following two lines each contain a string of length $n$. The $i$-th line contains the string $s_i$, consisting of the characters $\\texttt{A}$ and $\\texttt{J}$. If $s_{i,j}=\\texttt{A}$, the house in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column will select Álvaro. Otherwise if $s_{i,j}=\\texttt{J}$, the house will select José.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum number of districts Álvaro can win by optimally dividing the houses into districts.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Input #1\n\n```\n\n4\n\n3\n\nAAA\n\nAJJ\n\n6\n\nJAJAJJ\n\nJJAJAJ\n\n6\n\nAJJJAJ\n\nAJJAAA\n\n9\n\nAJJJJAJAJ\n\nJAAJJJJJA\n\n```\n\n#### Output #1\n\n```\n2\n2\n3\n2\n```\n\n### Note\n\nThe image below showcases the optimal arrangement of districts Álvaro can use for each test case in the example.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/201cafe7ad173f25765de51cfc513d2eb124be57.png)",
