A set of cells is called \"pointwise-contiguous\" if one can reach any cell\nof the set from any other by a sequence of moves up, down, left, right, or\ndiagonally. A \"region\" is a non-empty edgewise-contiguous set of\ncells.  A region is called \"holey\" if the complement of the region\n(which includes the infinite cells outside the $N \\times N$ grid) is not\npointwise-contiguous.  The \"border\" of a region is the set of cells\northogonally adjacent (up, down,   left, or right) to some cell  in the region,\nbut which is not in the region itself.  A \"valley\" is any non-holey\nregion such that every cell in the region has height lower than every cell on\nthe region's border.\nBessie's goal is to determine the sum of the sizes of all valleys.\n\nExamples\nThis is a region:\n\noo.\nooo\n..o\nThis is not a region (the middle cell and the lower-right cell are not\nedgewise-contiguous):\n\noo.\noo.\n..o\nThis is a non-holey region:\n\nooo\no..\no..\nThis is a holey region (the single cell within the \"donut\" shape is not\npointwise-contiguous with the \"outside\" of the region):\n\nooo\no.o\nooo\nThis is another non-holey region (the single cell in the enter is\npointwise-contiguous with the cell in the lower-right corner):\n\nooo\no.o\noo.\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nFirst line contains integer $N$, where $1 \\le N \\le 750$.\n\nNext $N$ lines each contain $N$ integers, the heights of the cells of the grid.\nEach height $h$ will satisfy $1 \\le h \\le 10^6$. Every height will be a distinct\ninteger.\n\nIn at least 19% of the test cases, it is further guaranteed that $N \\leq 100$.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nOutput a single integer, the sum of the sizes of all valleys.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n3\n1 10 2\n20 100 30\n3 11 50\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n30\n\nIn this example, there are three valleys of size 1:\n\no.o\n...\no..\nOne valley of size 2:\n\n...\n...\noo.\nOne valley of size 3:\n\nooo\n...\n...\nOne valley of size 6:\n\nooo\no..\noo.\nOne valley of size 7:\n\nooo\no.o\noo.\nAnd one valley of size 9:\n\nooo\nooo\nooo\nThus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30.\n\n\nProblem credits: Travis Hance\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
