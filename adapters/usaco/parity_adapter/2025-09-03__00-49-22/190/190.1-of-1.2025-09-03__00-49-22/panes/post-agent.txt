[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Clumsy Cows [Brian Dean, 2012]

Bessie the cow is trying to type a balanced string of parentheses into her
new laptop, but she is sufficiently clumsy (due to her large hooves) that
she keeps mis-typing characters.  Please help her by computing the minimum
number of characters in the string that one must reverse (e.g., changing a
left parenthesis to a right parenthesis, or vice versa) so that the string
would become balanced.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: clumsy

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of even length at most 100,000
        characters.

SAMPLE INPUT:

())(

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum number of parentheses
        that must be toggled to convert the string into a balanced
        string.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The last parenthesis must be toggled, and so must one of the two middle
right parentheses.

**Analyzing parentheses balance**

I'm working through how to fix imbalance in a string of parentheses. Every two extra opens can potentially be fixed by a reversal. When I flip one '(', it actua
lly reduces the balance by 2, which is interesting. I realize I need to convert half of the remaining opens to closes to balance it out. For instance, with the
sample "())(", I see the final flips needed confirm my understanding. It feels good to deduce that edge cases like even string lengths work correctly!
**Planning the parentheses solution**

I need to compute the number of flips required to balance a parentheses string. First, I’ll restate the problem and outline my approach. The plan is to read the
 input, track balance with flips as I process the string.

I’ll maintain a balance that increases with '(' and decreases with ')'. If balance drops below zero, it means I've got excess ')', so I’ll flip one and incremen
t flips. After processing, I'll account for any remaining openings. I'll provide a detailed breakdown, then save the code to a file. This structured approach sh
ould lead to a clean solution!

1. Restatement
   Given an even-length string of parentheses, compute the minimum number of character flips (changing ‘(’ to ‘)’ or vice versa) needed to make it balanced—i.e.
, equal counts of ‘(’ and ‘)’, and no prefix has more ‘)’ than ‘(’.

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Traverse the string, tracking a running balance (`+1` for ‘(’, `-1` for ‘)’).
   - If the balance ever drops below zero, it means there’s an unmatched ‘)’. We “flip” that to ‘(’, count one flip, and reset balance to 1.
   - After the pass, any remaining positive balance represents extra ‘(’. Two of those can be fixed with one flip, so add `balance // 2` to the flip count.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read s
   balance = 0
   flips = 0
   for each c in s:
       if c == '(':
           balance += 1
       else:
           balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               flips += 1
               balance = 1
   flips += balance // 2
   print flips
   ```

4. The implementation is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and pipe input in.
