[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Times17 [Brian Dean, 2012]

After realizing that there is much money to be made in software
development, Farmer John has launched a small side business writing short
programs for clients in the local farming industry.

Farmer John's first programming task seems quite simple to him -- almost
too simple: his client wants him to write a program that takes a number N
as input, and prints 17 times N as output.  Farmer John has just finished
writing this simple program when the client calls him up in a panic and
informs him that the input and output both must be expressed as binary
numbers, and that these might be quite large.

Please help Farmer John complete his programming task.  Given an input
number N, written in binary with at most 1000 digits, please write out the
binary representation of 17 times N.

PROBLEM NAME: times17

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N (at most 1000 digits).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10110111

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N times 17.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

110000100111

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The binary number 10110111 is equal to 183 in decimal form.
183 x 17 = 3111 is 110000100111 in binary format.

**Planning binary multiplication**

The user needs a plan to multiply a binary string by 17. First, I'll restate the problem and then conceptualize the solution, which includes writing pseudocode
and implementing it in Python 3.

Considering constraints, the input can be a binary string of up to 1000 digits. While I could use naive integer conversion for multiplication, a more direct met
hod involves multiplying the binary string by 16 (left-shifting) and adding the original string. I could also convert the string to an integer, perform the mult
iplication, and convert it back. I'll keep these options in mind!
**Conceptualizing binary operations**

I’m refining my approach to directly manipulate binary strings. Shifting left by 4 means appending four zeros to the string and then performing binary addition.
 This requires a function to handle binary addition.

My plan includes reading the input string, shifting it, adding the two strings together with the binary addition function, and printing the result without leadi
ng zeros.

I’ll also consider edge cases where the input might be '0'. While I could use built-in big integers, the manual string manipulation is suitable here. I’ll ensur
e that the solution is structured with a clear restatement, conceptualization, pseudocode, and the final code in `solution.py`.
**Structuring the solution**

I’m preparing to write the solution for multiplying a binary string representing \( N \) by 17. The first step is restating the problem; the input is a binary s
tring of up to 1000 bits, and the output should also be in binary.

Next, I’ll conceptualize the logic: to multiply by 17, I can shift the binary string left by 4 bits and then perform a binary addition of the original string.

Finally, I’ll outline the pseudocode, implement the actual function `bin_add`, and ensure everything is set to create and save `solution.py`. I want to document
 the whole process clearly, so I’ll include the steps in plain text along with the code. Let’s get to it!

1. Restatement
- Given a binary string N (up to 1000 bits), compute 17 × N and output its binary representation.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Multiplying by 17 equals shifting N left by 4 bits (×16) then adding N.
- Perform binary addition on the two strings.

3. Pseudocode
```
read binary string s
shifted = s + "0000"        # N << 4
result = binary_add(shifted, s)
trim leading zeros in result
if result is empty: result = "0"
print result
```
binary_add(a, b):
- Initialize indices i, j at ends of a, b; carry = 0; result = []
- While i>=0 or j>=0 or carry:
  - bit_a = digit of a if i>=0 else 0
  - bit_b = digit of b if j>=0 else 0
  - total = bit_a + bit_b + carry
  - append (total mod 2) to result, update carry = total // 2
  - decrement i, j
- Reverse result and join to string

4. Solution File
The implementation has been saved to `solution.py`.
