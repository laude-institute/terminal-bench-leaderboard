[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Fair Photography [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are standing at various positions along
a long one-dimensional fence.  The ith cow is standing at position x_i (an
integer in the range 0...1,000,000,000) and has breed b_i (either 'G' for
Guernsey or 'H' for Holstein).  No two cows occupy the same position.

FJ wants to take a photo of a contiguous interval of cows for the county
fair, but we wants all of his breeds to be fairly represented in the photo.
Therefore, he wants to ensure that, for whatever breeds are present in the
photo, there is an equal number of each breed (for example, a photo with
all Holsteins is ok, a photo with 27 Holsteins and 27 Guernseys is ok, but a
photo with 10 Holsteins and 9 Guernseys is not ok).  Help FJ take his fair
photo by finding the maximum size of a photo that satisfies FJ's
constraints.  The size of a photo is the difference between the maximum and
minimum positions of the cows in the photo.  It is possible that FJ could
end up taking a photo of just a single cow, in which case this photo would
have size zero.

PROBLEM NAME: fairphoto

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The largest fair photo Farmer John can take is of the middle 4 cows,
containing 2 Holsteins and 2 Guernseys.

**Analyzing cow segments**

I've realized the problem specifies that "a photo with all Holsteins is okay," meaning contiguous segments with only Holsteins or Guernseys are valid. To find t
he maximum size, we need the largest segment consisting of any single breed between the farthest matching pairs. However, mixed segments could potentially yield
 larger lengths. For example, in the sample sequence, the largest Guernsey segment is 3, while the best mixed segment spans 7, including both breeds. So, mixed
segments might just be bigger.
**Developing the algorithm**

I'm thinking about how to approach this problem. After sorting the list, I need to find the maximum interval with either a single breed or balanced counts. For
single-breed segments, I can scan through the list to track the longest run of the same breed by calculating position differences. Mixed segments, on the other
hand, will involve using a prefix sum array to find intervals where differences cancel each other out. I’ll track occurrences of the prefix difference to effect
ively identify balanced segments. I'll detail the steps clearly, as handling these segments separately seems more efficient.
**Finalizing the solution**

I'm thinking through the single-breed segments and noticing that the size difference between the same breed groups is quite small, like between positions 2 and
0. I realize the best balanced segment yields a size of 1 between two groups. I should implement the final solution by adding a script, ensuring it runs efficie
ntly without external dependencies. I’ll summarize the problem and my solution before finalizing everything. It’s time to call the necessary function to apply m
y patch and confirm that I’ve created the solution file!

**Clarifying the Fair Photography Problem**

The user is asking for a Python 3 implementation for the Fair Photography problem. First, I need to restate the problem clearly in plain English. Then, I'll con
ceptualize a solution before creating pseudocode. I'll ensure the solution is saved as `solution.py` and that no external libraries are used. This problem invol
ves counting two breeds and finding intervals with the same counts to maximize the difference between values. I need to keep in mind the details regarding breed
 count limitations.
**Analyzing Fair Photography Criteria**

I'm trying to figure out what the criteria are. The example mentions that a photo with all Holsteins is acceptable, indicating that having only one breed counts
 as fair. An interval is considered fair if the counts for each breed are equal or if one breed's count is zero. This means that if all cows belong to one breed
, the maximum interval is the entire set. For mixed breeds, I need to find subintervals that satisfy the conditions of equal counts or a count of zero for one b
reed. I'll focus on maximizing the difference between positions of breeds within these intervals.
**Streamlining the Prefix-Sum Logic**

Alright, I'm simplifying the approach to solving the problem. We'll sort by position and track the difference in counts between breeds using a prefix sum, where
 each difference is recorded with its first occurrence index.

If I find a matching difference value again, that indicates the interval between those indices has equal counts for the breeds. The size of the interval would b
e calculated from the positions of the cows. I need to keep track of these details carefully, ensuring that I maintain the correct positions for the intervals w
hile managing the prefix sums in an understandable way. Overall, it seems that organizing the cows' positions and their corresponding counts will lead us to the
 solution!
**Implementing Maximum Span Calculation**

I need to consider segments where only one breed is present, calculating the maximum span for contiguous segments of Gs or Hs. This involves recording the posit
ions of the last cow and first cow within those segments. Although single-breed segments might yield size zero, they can still be valid. I should maintain a run
ning total of maximum equal count differences while also tracking the longest single-breed segments. As I process the sorted cows, I'll update my results effici
ently, ensuring all segments are accounted for. Overall, the complexity remains manageable and the solution is clear.

**Clarifying the Python solution**

The user is asking for a Python 3 solution. First, I need to restate the problem simply and then conceptualize a solution. I'll draft pseudocode before saving i
t as solution.py. The limits are robust with N up to 100k and positions reaching 1e9, all represented by either breed G or H. I recognize that segments can show
 either equal counts of both breeds or just one breed. Segments with only one breed are acceptable, so I need to consider the maximum segment size as the differ
ence in positions.
**Maximizing segment distance**

My goal is to maximize the difference between positions of cows in segments sorted by their locations. For a segment, if both breed counts are positive, they mu
st be equal. It's clear that a segment made up exclusively of one breed is acceptable. I need to consider two segment types: one where all cows are the same bre
ed and another with equal counts of each breed.

I'll look for maximum distances within these segments, ensuring I appropriately track prefix sums to find equal counts more effectively. The key is to calculate
 distances accurately while considering contiguous positions.

1. Problem Restatement
Find, among all contiguous intervals of cows (sorted by position), the maximum distance between the first and last cow such that either:
- All cows in the interval are the same breed, or
- The number of Guernseys equals the number of Holsteins.

2. Solution Concept
- Sort cows by their positions.
- To handle equal-count intervals, use a prefix sum (G=+1, H=–1). Intervals with zero net change have equal counts; track the earliest index each prefix sum app
ears to compute maximal span.
- To handle single-breed intervals, scan for maximal runs of the same breed and track their end-to-end distance.
- The answer is the maximum of these two cases.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list of (position, breed) pairs
sort list by position
extract xs[], bs[] arrays of positions and breeds

# Equal-count segments
first_occ = {0:0}
prefix = 0
ans = 0
for j in 1..N:
    prefix += +1 if bs[j-1]=='G' else -1
    if prefix seen before at index i:
        size = xs[j-1] - xs[i]
        ans = max(ans, size)
    else:
        record first_occ[prefix] = j

# Single-breed runs
run_start = 0
run_breed = bs[0]
for i in 1..N-1:
    if bs[i] != run_breed:
        size = xs[i-1] - xs[run_start]
        ans = max(ans, size)
        run_start = i
        run_breed = bs[i]
# final run
size = xs[N-1] - xs[run_start]
ans = max(ans, size)

print(ans)
```

4. Implementation
The solution is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with Python 3:
```
chmod +x solution.py
./solution.py < input.txt
```
