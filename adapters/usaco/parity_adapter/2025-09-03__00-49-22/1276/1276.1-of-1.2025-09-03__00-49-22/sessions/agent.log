[BEGIN PROBLEM]

With the hottest recorded summer ever at Farmer John's farm, he needs a way to
cool down his cows. Thus, he decides to invest in some air conditioners. 

Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 20$) live in a barn that contains a 
sequence of stalls in a row, numbered $1 \ldots 100$.  Cow $i$ occupies a range
of  these stalls, starting from stall $s_i$ and ending with stall $t_i$.  The
ranges of stalls occupied by different cows are all disjoint from each-other. 
Cows have different cooling requirements.  Cow $i$ must be cooled by an amount
$c_i$, meaning every stall occupied by cow $i$ must have its temperature reduced
by at least $c_i$ units.

The barn contains $M$ air conditioners, labeled $1 \ldots M$
($1 \leq M \leq 10$). The $i$th air conditioner costs $m_i$ units of money to
operate ($1 \leq m_i \leq 1000$) and cools the range of stalls starting from
stall $a_i$ and ending with stall $b_i$.  If running, the $i$th air conditioner
reduces the temperature of all the stalls in this range by $p_i$
($1 \leq p_i \leq 10^6$).  Ranges of stalls covered by air conditioners may
potentially overlap.

Running a farm is no easy business, so FJ has a tight budget. Please determine
the minimum amount of money he needs to spend to keep all of his cows
comfortable. It is guaranteed that if FJ uses all of his conditioners, then all
cows will be comfortable.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains $N$ and $M$.

The next $N$ lines describe cows.  The $i$th of these lines contains $s_i$,
$t_i$, and $c_i$.

The next $M$ lines describe air conditioners.  The $i$th of these lines contains
$a_i$, $b_i$, $p_i$, and $m_i$.

For every input other than the sample, you can assume that $M = 10$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer telling the minimum amount of money FJ needs to spend to
operate enough air conditioners to satisfy all his cows (with the conditions
listed above). 


SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
1 5 2

1 6 2 8

SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
10

One possible solution that results in the least amount of money spent is to
select those that cool the intervals $[2, 9]$, $[1, 2]$, and $[6, 9]$, for a
cost of $3 + 2 + 5 = 10$.

**Approaching cooling requirements**

I need to determine if each cow's cooling needs are met across selected stalls. The plan is to sum the cooling effects from chosen ACs for each cow's stall range and check if it satisfies the requirement. While dynamic programming is an option, I'll stick with a brute-force approach since the problem size is manageable. Precomputing contributions per stall from each AC seems like an efficient method too. I'll work on creating pseudocode and then implement it in a Python file.
**Implementing solution code**

I need to finalize the coding task by creating a script named `solution.py`, which will read input and calculate the minimum cost using a brute-force approach with masks. I plan to use itertools for more efficient bitmask handling. 

I'll construct an array for cooling capacities, ensuring it meets each cow's needs across specified ranges. The edge cases need careful consideration, particularly ensuring that no cow's requirements are overlooked in neighboring stalls. Once everything is set, I'll write the final code to the file.
**Finalizing output structure**

I need to make sure the input reading is accurate, possibly switching to reading line by line instead of the bulk method. I’ll proceed to create a structured output that includes the following: 

First, I'll restate the problem in plain English, then outline a conceptual solution also in simple terms. After that, I'll draft the pseudocode detailing the steps involved. Finally, I’ll implement the actual solution in `solution.py` and apply the necessary changes. Let's get started!

**Problem Restatement**
- We have up to 20 cows, each occupying a disjoint interval of stalls numbered 1–100 and requiring a minimum cooling amount over its interval.
- We have up to 10 air conditioners, each covering an interval of stalls, providing a fixed cooling amount if run, and incurring a cost.
- Select a subset of air conditioners at minimum total cost so that every stall occupied by each cow gets at least that cow’s required cooling.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Because there are at most 10 air conditioners, exhaustively try all \(2^M\) subsets.
- For each subset:
  - Sum its total operating cost.
  - Build an array of length 100 to accumulate cooling contributed to each stall.
  - For each AC in the subset, add its cooling to every stall in its coverage.
  - Verify for each cow that every stall in its range meets or exceeds its required cooling.
  - Track the minimum cost among valid subsets.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
read list of cows: (s_i, t_i, c_i)
read list of ACs: (a_j, b_j, p_j, m_j)
best_cost = infinity

for mask from 0 to (1 << M) - 1:
    total_cost = 0
    cooling = array[1..100] initialized to 0

    for each bit j in 0..M-1:
        if mask has bit j set:
            total_cost += m_j
            for stall from a_j to b_j:
                cooling[stall] += p_j

    if total_cost >= best_cost: continue

    valid = true
    for each cow (s, t, req):
        for stall from s to t:
            if cooling[stall] < req:
                valid = false
                break
        if not valid:
            break

    if valid:
        best_cost = total_cost

print(best_cost)
```
