[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It turns out there is one factor that matters far more than any other when
determining whether two cows are compatible as potential friends: whether they
like similar flavors of ice cream!

Farmer John's $N$ cows ($2 \leq N \leq 50,000$) have each listed their five
favorite flavors of ice cream.  To make this list concise, each possible flavor
is represented by a positive integer ID at most $10^6$.  Two cows are compatible
if their lists contain at least one common flavor of ice cream.

Please determine the number of pairs of cows that are NOT compatible

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$. Each of the following $N$ lines contain 5
integers (all different) representing the favorite ice cream flavors of one cow.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of pairs of cows that are not compatible.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 10 8
10 9 8 7 6
50 60 70 80 90
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

Here, cow 4 is not compatible with any of cows 1, 2, or 3, and cows 1 and 3 are
also not compatible.

**Counting incompatible cow pairs**

I'm focusing on counting pairs of cows that don't share any flavors, given that each cow has five distinct favorite flavors. First, I need to compute the total
possible pairs, which is done using combinations. Then, I subtract the number of compatible pairs, meaning those that share at least one flavor. For this, I’ll
utilize inclusion-exclusion. I'll analyze subsets of the five flavors, generating keys for them, and appropriately count occurrences. Finally, I’ll compute the
incompatible pairs by subtracting compatible from total pairs.
**Implementing cow flavor pairs calculation**

I'm focusing on computing the number of cow pairs that share at least one flavor using inclusion-exclusion. There are constraints to consider since N can go up
to 50,000, and each cow has 5 flavors. I’ll use a dictionary to track subset counts and build pairs based on these counts. After identifying compatible pairs, I
'll determine total pairs and calculate incompatible ones. The algorithm should handle this efficiently, but I’ll need to ensure edge cases and memory managemen
t are correctly addressed as I prepare to deliver the steps, conceptualization, pseudocode, and solution file.
**Creating solution.py**

I’m preparing to generate the `solution.py` file as requested. The solution involves implementing the given algorithm in Python. My plan is to outline the probl
em, provide a conceptual solution, and then present the pseudocode. For the actual code, I will rely on standard libraries, particularly importing `sys` for eff
icient input handling and `defaultdict` for counting subsets. The script will include a `main()` function to execute the logic, and after writing everything out
, I'll apply the patch to create the file. Let's move on to that!

**Problem Restatement**
Count how many pairs of cows (out of N) share no common favorite ice-cream flavor among their lists of five flavors each.

**Solution Concept**
- Total pairs = N choose 2.
- Count pairs that *are* compatible (share ≥1 flavor) via inclusion–exclusion over subsets of flavors:
  • For each non-empty subset of a cow’s 5 flavors, tally how many cows have exactly that subset.
  • By inclusion–exclusion, sum “C(count,2)” for odd-sized subsets and subtract for even-sized.
- Subtract the compatible count from total pairs to get incompatible pairs.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
initialize empty map subset_count
for each cow:
    read and sort its 5 flavors
    for every mask from 1 to 2^5-1:
        build subset of flavors where mask bit is set
        increment subset_count[subset]
compatible = 0
for each subset, count in subset_count:
    if count >= 2:
        pairs = count*(count-1)/2
        if subset size odd: compatible += pairs
        else: compatible -= pairs
total_pairs = N*(N-1)/2
print(total_pairs - compatible)
```

The complete implementation has been saved to **solution.py**. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
