[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow has enrolled in a computer science PhD program, driven by her
love of computer science and also the  allure of one day becoming "Dr. Bessie".
Having worked for some time on her academic research, she has now published  $N$
papers ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$), and her $i$-th paper has accumulated $c_i$
citations ($0 \leq c_i \leq 10^5$) from other papers in the research literature.

Bessie has heard that an academic's success can be measured by their $h$-index.
The $h$-index is the largest number $h$ such that the researcher has at least
$h$ papers each with at least $h$ citations. For example, a researcher with $4$
papers and respective citation counts $(1,100,2,3)$ has an $h$-index of $2$,
whereas if the citation counts were $(1,100,3,3)$ then the $h$-index would be
$3$.

To up her $h$-index, Bessie is planning to write up to $K$ survey articles
($0 \leq K \leq 10^5$), each citing many of her past papers. However,  due to
page limits, she can only cite at most $L$ papers in each survey
($0 \leq L \leq 10^5$). Of course, no paper may be cited multiple times in a
single survey (but a paper may be cited in several surveys).

Help Bessie determine the maximum $h$-index she may achieve after writing these
survey articles. Bessie is not allowed to cite a survey from one of her surveys.

Note that Bessie's research advisor should probably inform her at some point
that writing a survey solely to increase one's $h$ index is ethically dubious;
other academics are not recommended to follow Bessie's example here.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$, $K$, and $L$.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $c_1,\ldots, c_N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The maximum $h$-index on a single line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 4 1
1 100 1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, Bessie may write up to $4$ survey articles, each citing at most $1$ paper.
If she cites each of her first and third articles twice, then her $h$-index
becomes
$3$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 1 4
1 100 1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

In this second example, Bessie may write at most a single article. If Bessie cites any
of her first, third, or fourth papers at least once, her $h$-index becomes $2$.

SCORING:
Test cases 1-6 satisfy $N\le 100$.Test cases 7-16 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Maximizing h-index**

I'm looking to maximize the h-index and find the maximum h such that at least h papers have new citations of at least h. It involves selecting at least h papers
 and adjusting their citations within certain limits. For each paper, if its initial citations are already above h, there's no cost to qualify. If it's close en
ough, I calculate the needed increase. Papers that can't meet the requirements are skipped. I'll sort the ones that can by their costs and sum the minimum costs
 for the top h papers.
**Optimizing h-index calculation**

When picking papers to maximize the h-index, I should prioritize those with initial citations above or equal to h, since that costs nothing. Next, I’ll focus on
 papers needing small citation increases. I define M as the number of papers with sufficient citations and R as those needing extra citations. For each h candid
ate, it’s essential to gather costs from papers with citations just below h. I'll also consider efficient ways to sort and manage these costs to keep operations
 minimized, possibly pre-sorting citations for efficiency.

**Analyzing citation allocation**

I’m considering a paper's boost, which is limited to K. If the delta exceeds K, boosting isn’t possible. For deltas between 1 and K, I need to allocate citation
s accordingly. I’m searching for a way to elevate at least h papers to meet or exceed h citations within the total budget for citations, which is K multiplied b
y L. To confirm, I’ll collect papers with current citations below h and ensure their deltas are manageable to achieve this goal efficiently.
**Developing a solution**

I need to summarize the process of determining if I can boost a certain number of papers' citations. I’ll check the smallest deltas to ensure they fit within th
e total citation limit. My algorithm involves reading inputs, binary searching for the maximum number of papers (h), and counting citations. If some papers fall
 below a threshold, I gather deltas and verify if they can be boosted.

The overall complexity seems manageable, but I also need to ensure proper handling of edge cases like zero boosts. Finally, I should prepare a detailed response
 in sections, implementing the solution in a Python file named `solution.py`.
**Structuring the solution**

I can write plain text for the first three sections and then present the content for `solution.py`. To format it clearly, I'll use headings like **Restatement**
, **Solution Outline**, and **Pseudocode** in bullets and numbered steps.

Next, I’ll state that I’m adding the implementation file `solution.py`. The code will read inputs, sort citations, and implement a function to check if the boos
ting condition is met.

Finally, I’ll prepare to add the `solution.py` file with the implemented code.

**Planning a Python Solution**

The user is asking for a Python solution to a problem that involves multiple steps: restating the problem, conceptualizing a solution, writing pseudocode, and s
aving the solution as a file. I'll start by restating the problem in simple terms, then describe my solution approach clearly. Writing the pseudocode will help
me lay out the logic before I implement it in the actual `solution.py` file. Since the user didn't specifically request a formal plan, I'll focus on incorporati
ng any necessary steps organically as I reason through the solution.
**Analyzing Task Scheduling**

I'm considering whether it's possible to schedule these tasks based on their requirements. The idea is that each task can only go into one of the available bins
, and the total demand can’t exceed the bin capacity. I think I need to apply bipartite matching principles and possibly use Hall's condition for feasibility. S
o, I’ll check if the sum of demands for jobs meets the needed criteria using binary search to determine possible scheduling. I also need to sort the requirement
s and manage counts effectively.

Here’s the full solution:

**Restated Problem**
Given N papers with citation counts, Bessie can write up to K survey articles, each citing up to L distinct papers (each paper can be cited at most once per sur
vey). Each such citation raises a paper’s count by 1. Determine the maximum h-index achievable, where h-index is the largest h such that at least h papers have
≥ h citations.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort the citation counts.
- Binary‐search on candidate h (0…N).
- For a given h:
  - Count papers already ≥ h (call this ge).
  - If ge ≥ h, it’s feasible.
  - Otherwise we need to “boost” (h − ge) papers up to h.
  - Choose the (h−ge) papers with highest existing citations below h to minimize extra citations required.
  - Let total_needed = sum of (h − ci) over those papers; must satisfy total_needed ≤ K·L.
  - Also no single paper requires more than K extra (i.e. h − min_selected_ci ≤ K).
- Use prefix sums for fast computation of total_needed.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K, L
read list citations
sort citations ascending
build prefix sums array of citations
define can(h):
    idx = first index where citations[idx] ≥ h
    ge = N − idx
    if ge ≥ h: return True
    need = h − ge
    if need > idx: return False
    sum_below = prefix[idx] − prefix[idx−need]
    total_needed = need*h − sum_below
    if total_needed > K*L: return False
    if h − citations[idx−need] > K: return False
    return True
binary search lo=0, hi=N+1:
    mid=(lo+hi)//2
    if can(mid): lo=mid else hi=mid
print(lo)
```

The implementation is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
