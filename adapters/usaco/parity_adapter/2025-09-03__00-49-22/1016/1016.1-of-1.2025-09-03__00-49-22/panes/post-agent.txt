[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's new barn has a truly strange design: it consists of $N$ rooms
($2 \leq N \leq 2500$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$, and $N-1$ corridors.
Each corridor connects a pair of rooms, in such a way that it is possible to
walk from any room to any other room along a series of corridors.

Every room in the barn has a circular clock on the wall with the standard
integers $1 \ldots 12$ around its face. However, these clocks only have one
hand, which always points directly at one of the integers on the clock face (it
never points between two of these integers).

Bessie the cow wants to synchronize all the clocks in the barn so they all point
to the integer 12.  However, she is somewhat simple-minded, and as she walks
around the barn, every time she enters a room, she moves the hand on its clock
ahead by one position. For example, if the clock pointed at 5, it would now
point at 6, and if the clock pointed at 12, it would now point at 1.  If Bessie
enters the same room multiple times, she advances the clock in that room every
time she enters.

Please determine the number of rooms in which Bessie could start walking around
the barn such that she could conceivably set all the clocks to point to 12.
Note that Bessie does not initially advance the clock in her starting room, but
she would advance the clock in that room any time she re-entered it.  Clocks do
not advance on their own; a clock only advances if Bessie enters its room.
Furthermore, once Bessie enters a corridor she must exit through the other end
(it is not allowed to walk partially through the corridor and loop back around
to the same room).

SCORING:
Test cases 2-7 satisfy $N\le 100$.Test cases 8-15 satisfy no additional constraints.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next line contains $N$ integers, each
in the range $1 \ldots 12$, specifying the initial clock setting in each room.
The next $N-1$ lines each describe a corridor in terms of two integers $a$ and
$b$, each in the range $1 \ldots N$, giving the room numbers connected by the
corridor.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the number of rooms in which Bessie could start, such that it is possible
for her to set all clocks to point to 12.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
11 10 11 11
1 2
2 3
2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, Bessie can set all the clocks to point to 12 if and only if she starts
in room 2 (for example, by moving to room 1, 2, 3, 2, and finally 4).

[2025-09-03T05:02:54] codex

**Problem Restatement**
We have a tree of \(N\) rooms (numbered \(1\ldots N\)), each with a one-hand clock showing 1–12. Bessie picks a starting room \(S\) (she does *not* advance that
 clock initially). Then she walks along corridors. Every time she *enters* a room, she advances that clock by one hour (with 12 rolling to 1). She can revisit r
ooms arbitrarily (but can’t turn around mid-corridor). We need to count how many choices of \(S\) admit *some* sequence of moves that sets *all* clocks to 12.

---

**Solution Concept**
1. Label each room’s distance parity (even/odd) from a chosen start \(S\).
2. Observe that any walk that visits rooms arbitrarily gives each room a number of entries whose parity we can toggle by routing more visits. One can show (by p
arity arguments or the USACO editorial) that it suffices to check whether
\[
(\text{sum of initial clock‐values on even‐parity rooms}) \;-\;(\text{sum on odd‐parity rooms})
\;\equiv\;0\text{ or }1\pmod{12}.
\]
If so, there *is* a way to visit rooms to synchronize all clocks to 12.

Thus, for each candidate start \(S\):
- Do a BFS to partition rooms by distance parity.
- Sum clock‐values mod 12 on even vs. odd layers.
- If \((\text{evenSum} - \text{oddSum})\bmod12\) is 0 or 1, \(S\) is valid.
Count all such \(S\).

This is \(O(N)\) per start × \(N\) starts = \(O(N^2)\), which is fine up to \(N=2500\).

---

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read clocks[1..N]
for i in 1..N:
  clocks[i] %= 12

build adjacency list adj[1..N]

answer = 0
for start in 1..N:
  depth[1..N] = -1
  depth[start] = 0
  queue = [start]
  while queue not empty:
    u = queue.pop()
    for v in adj[u]:
      if depth[v] == -1:
        depth[v] = depth[u] + 1
        enqueue v

  evenSum = 0
  oddSum = 0
  for i in 1..N:
    if depth[i] % 2 == 0:
      evenSum += clocks[i]
    else:
      oddSum += clocks[i]

  diff = (evenSum - oddSum) % 12
  if diff == 0 or diff == 1:
    answer += 1

print(answer)
```

---

**Implementation (`solution.py`)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from collections import deque

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    clocks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    # convert 12→0 for modulo arithmetic
    for i in range(N):
        clocks[i] %= 12

    adj = [[] for _ in range(N)]
    for _ in range(N-1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        a -= 1
        b -= 1
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)

    answer = 0
    # Try each room as starting point
    for start in range(N):
        depth = [-1]*N
        depth[start] = 0
        dq = deque([start])
        while dq:
            u = dq.popleft()
            for v in adj[u]:
                if depth[v] == -1:
                    depth[v] = depth[u] + 1
                    dq.append(v)

        evenSum = 0
        oddSum = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if depth[i] & 1:
                oddSum += clocks[i]
            else:
                evenSum += clocks[i]

        diff = (evenSum - oddSum) % 12
        if diff == 0 or diff == 1:
            answer += 1

    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of Key Steps**
- We reduce clock readings modulo 12 (treating 12 as 0) so that “advance by 1” is simply \(+1\) mod 12.
- For each candidate start, a BFS labels rooms by distance parity.
- The criterion \((\text{evenSum}-\text{oddSum})\bmod12\in\{0,1\}\) exactly captures which roots admit a valid walk to synchronize all clocks.
