[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Simplifying the Farm [Nathan Pinsker, 2011]

Farmer John has been taking an evening algorithms course at his local
university, and he has just learned about minimum spanning trees.  However,
Farmer John now realizes that the design of his farm is not as efficient as
it could be, and he wants to simplify the layout of his farm.

The farm is currently arranged like a graph, with vertices representing
fields and edges representing pathways between these fields, each having an
associated length.  Farmer John notes that for each distinct length,
at most three pathways on his farm share this length.  FJ would like to
remove some of the pathways on his farm so that it becomes a tree -- that
is, so that there is one unique route between any pair of fields.  Moreover,
Farmer John would like this to be a minimum spanning tree -- a tree having
the smallest possible sum of edge lengths.

Help Farmer John compute not only the sum of edge lengths in a minimum
spanning tree derived from his farm graph, but also the number of different
possible minimum spanning trees he can create.

PROBLEM NAME: simplify

        <= n_i <= 1,000,000)  representing an edge from vertex a_i to
        b_i with length n_i.  No edge length n_i will occur more than
        three times.

**Analyzing weight groups for Kruskal's algorithm**

I need to process weight groups based on edges. For each group with a specific weight, I’ll identify the edges connecting different components, marking them as
candidates if they don't create a cycle.

I’ll then determine how many candidate edges exist and how many are necessary for connecting components based on Kruskal’s method. An important point is that I
can iterate through edges in any order, making the selection process flexible.
**Counting spanning forests in MST**

To count the minimum spanning tree (MST), I’m looking at the graph formed by components as supernodes and the candidate edges. I need to find the number of span
ning forests connecting these components by choosing the right edges.

For each weight group, I’ll create a subgraph where nodes represent current components. The number of connected components will help determine how many edges I
need. Using Kirchhoff's theorem, I’ll calculate the number of spanning trees for each component to identify valid edge combinations needed for the unions.
**Calculating spanning trees in components**

Each component in my graph is small, with at most three edges, which simplifies the analysis. I need to consider how many spanning trees can be formed within th
ese components, using the number of edges and nodes.

For each component, I'm going to check the edge counts. If the edges equal the number of nodes minus one, it’s a tree. If they’re equal, I’ll have one cycle, wh
ere the count of spanning trees equals the cycle length. If the edges exceed the nodes, it’s impossible.

I'll also handle multigraphs by constructing a Laplacian matrix to compute the total number of spanning trees and use integer arithmetic for accurate results.
**Implementing MST with determinants**

I'm focusing on the determinants for sizes up to 2, 3, or 4, which is manageable. I’ll update the total count with the determinant and calculate the total weigh
t based on the edge unions and spanning components.

For each node in the components, I’ll find the unique roots, ensuring I only account for the necessary unions. I’ll iterate over candidate edges, unioning them
as needed while avoiding cycles. My next steps involve reading the inputs, sorting edges, and implementing the algorithm cleanly as I move to write the solution

**Problem Restatement**
We have an undirected weighted graph of \(N\) fields (vertices) and \(M\) paths (edges).  Each edge has an integer length, and no length value appears on more t
han three edges.  We want to prune edges so that the remaining graph is:
1. A tree (exactly one path between any two vertices).
2. Has minimum possible total edge length (a minimum spanning tree, MST).
We must compute
- The total length of an MST.
- The number of distinct MSTs, modulo \(10^9+7\).

**Solution Sketch**
We run a modified Kruskal’s algorithm:
1. Sort edges by weight.
2. Process edges in groups of equal weight.  Within each group:
   - Identify “candidate” edges whose endpoints lie in different current DSU components.
   - Form a small multigraph \(H\) whose nodes are these DSU-components and whose edges are the candidates.
   - For each connected component of \(H\), count its spanning trees (via the Matrix-Tree theorem on its Laplacian minor).  Multiply these counts into our globa
l MST count.
   - The number of edges we actually add from this group equals \(\sum (\#\text{nodes} -1)\) over the components of \(H\); add that many copies of the group’s w
eight to the total MST weight.
   - Finally union all candidate edges in the DSU (they’ll union exactly when they link distinct components).

Because each weight appears on at most three edges, each group’s subgraph \(H\) has at most three edges (and at most six nodes), so building its Laplacian and d
oing a small determinant is very fast.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
edges = [(u,v,w)...]
sort edges by w
init DSU of size N
total_weight = 0
total_count = 1
MOD = 1e9+7

i = 0
while i < M:
    w = edges[i].w
    collect edges[i..j) with same w
    candidates = []
    for each edge (u,v,w):
        ru = find(u), rv = find(v)
        if ru != rv:
            candidates.append((ru,rv))
    if candidates nonempty:
        reindex distinct roots in candidates → 0..k-1
        build adjacency / edge-list for this tiny graph H
        mark all nodes in H, find its connected components
        for each component C:
            let n = #nodes in C
            let edges = list of multiedges in C
            build n×n Laplacian L
            remove last row+column → (n−1)×(n−1) matrix M
            t = det(M) mod MOD
            total_count = total_count * t % MOD
            total_weight += w * (n−1)
        for each (u,v) in candidates:
            union(u,v)
    i = j

print total_weight, total_count
