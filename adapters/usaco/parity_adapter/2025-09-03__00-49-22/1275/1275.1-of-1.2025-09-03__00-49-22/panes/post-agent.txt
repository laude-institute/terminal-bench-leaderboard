Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Farmer John has $N$ cows ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$). Each cow has a breed that is
either Guernsey or Holstein.  As is often the case, the cows are standing in a
line, numbered $1 \ldots N$ in this order.

Over the course of the day, each cow writes down a list of cows.  Specifically,
cow $i$'s list contains the range of cows starting with herself (cow $i$) up to
and including cow $E_i$ ($i \leq E_i \leq N$).

FJ has recently discovered that each breed of cow has exactly one distinct
leader. FJ does not know who the leaders are, but he knows that each leader must
have a list that includes all the cows of their breed, or the other breed's
leader (or both).

Help FJ count the number of pairs of cows that could be leaders. It is
guaranteed that there is at least one possible pair.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The second line contains a string of length $N$, with the $i$th character
denoting the breed of the $i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey and H meaning Holstein).
It is guaranteed that there is at least one Guernsey and one Holstein.

The third line contains $E_1 \dots E_N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the number of possible pairs of leaders.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
GHHG
2 4 3 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

The only valid leader pair is $(1, 2)$. Cow $1$'s list contains the other
breed's leader (cow $2$). Cow $2$'s list contains all cows of her breed
(Holstein).

No other pairs are valid. For example, $(2,4)$ is invalid since cow $4$'s list
does not contain the other breed's leader, and it also does not contain all cows
of her breed.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
GGH
2 3 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

There are two valid leader pairs, $(1, 3)$ and $(2, 3)$.

SCORING
Inputs 3-5: $N \leq 100$Inputs 6-10: $N \leq 3000$Inputs 11-17: No additional constraints.

[2025-09-03T04:57:17] thinking

**Analyzing breeding conditions**

I'm considering a pair (i, j) where i is of breed G and j is of breed H. The conditions are that the energy E_i of i should be greater than or equal to either l
ast_G or j, and for j, the energy E_j should be greater than or equal to either last_H or i. It's important to compute last_G and last_H as they represent the m
aximum index of cows for each breed. I need an efficient approach since N can go up to 100k, making a brute force method impractical.
**Counting valid pairs**

I need to count pairs (i, j) where i is from g_positions and j is from h_positions and they satisfy the conditions. Specifically, E_i should be greater than or
equal to either last_G or j, and E_j must be greater than or equal to either last_H or i.

Instead of focusing on valid pairs directly, I can count the total pairs and subtract the invalid ones. To do that, I can apply the inclusion-exclusion principl
e for counting invalid pairs based on specific conditions the cows must satisfy. It sounds complicated, but I'll tackle it step by step.
**Preparing solution file**

I need to create a solution.py file that includes a clear problem restatement, conceptual explanation, and corresponding pseudocode. The first step is to restat
e the problem in plain English, depicting the conceptual solution before diving into the pseudocode. Following that, I'll implement the code in Python, ensuring
 we utilize a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) since N can go up to 100,000.

Once I prepare all textual descriptions, I'll use a process to write the complete solution into the designated file. Let’s get that organized!

1. Problem restated:
   Count how many ways to pick one Guernsey cow and one Holstein cow as leaders so that each leader’s list (from their index to E_i) either covers all cows of t
heir own breed or includes the other leader.

2. Conceptual solution:
   - Let G and H be lists of indices of Guernsey and Holstein cows.
   - A pair (i∈G, j∈H) is invalid if the G-cow fails both conditions (its reach < last G and < j) or the H-cow fails both, minus those counted twice.
   - Use binary searches to count how many H’s exceed a given reach for G-fail and similarly for H-fail.
   - For the overlap (both failing), collect “small” G and H cows whose reaches are < their breed’s last index. Use a BIT (Fenwick) to count pairs satisfying i
> reach_j and j > reach_i in O(N log N).
   - Total valid = |G|*|H| − (G_fail + H_fail − both_fail).

3. Pseudocode:
```
read n, breed string s, list E
build sorted lists g_pos, h_pos
compute last_g, last_h
g_fail = sum over i in g_pos with E[i]<last_g of count of h_pos > E[i]
h_fail = sum over j in h_pos with E[j]<last_h of count of g_pos > E[j]
build H_small = [(j, E[j]) if E[j]<last_h], sorted by E[j]
build G_small = [(i, E[i]) if E[i]<last_g], sorted by i
initialize BIT over [1..n]
p=0
for (i, reach_i) in G_small:
    while p<len(H_small) and H_small[p].reach_j < i:
        bit.add(H_small[p].j)
        p++
    both_fail += bit.sum_range(reach_i+1, n)
total = len(g_pos)*len(h_pos)
print(total - (g_fail + h_fail - both_fail))
```
