[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's pasture can be represented by a $N\times N$  square grid
$(1\le N\le 300)$ consisting of positions $(i,j)$ for all $1\le i,j\le N$. For
each square of the grid, the corresponding character in the input is equal to
'*' if there exists a single cow at that position and '.' if there does not
exist a cow at that position.

FJ believes that the beauty of his pasture is directly proportional to the
number of triples of cows such that their positions are equidistant from each
other. In other words, they form an equilateral triangle. Unfortunately, it was
only quite recently that FJ realized that since all of his cows are located at
integer coordinates, no beautiful triples can possibly exist if Euclidean
distance is used! Thus, FJ has decided to switch to use "Manhattan" distance
instead. Formally, the Manhattan distance between two positions $(x_0,y_0)$ and
$(x_1,y_1)$ is equal to $|x_0-x_1|+|y_0-y_1|$.

Given the grid representing the positions of the cows, compute the number of
equilateral triples.

SCORING:
There will be fourteen test cases aside from the sample, one for each of
$N\in \{50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,275,300,300,300,300\}.$

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N.$

For each $1\le i\le N,$ line $i+1$ of the input contains a string of length $N$
consisting solely of the characters '*' and '.'. The $j$th character
describes whether there exists a cow at position $(i,j)$ or not.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer containing the answer. It can be shown that it fits into
a signed 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
*..
.*.
*..
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

There are three cows, and they form an equilateral triple because the Manhattan
distance between each pair of cows is equal to two.

[2025-09-03T05:35:34] thinking

**Finding equilateral triangles**

I'm looking to count equilateral triangles using the Manhattan distance metric on a 300x300 grid with cows represented by '*'. The goal is to find triples of po
sitions where all pairwise Manhattan distances are equal. In this metric, equilateral triangles take the form of axis-aligned shapes oriented at 45 degrees. Giv
en two points A and B with a distance d, I need to determine the number of possible third points C that maintain this distance. It seems there might be two poss
ible locations for point C.
**Finding intersection points**

I want to determine the intersection of two L1 circles (diamonds) of radius d centered at points A and B. These circles represent points equidistant from each c
enter. The equations to solve are |x-xA|+|y-yA|=d and |x-xB|+|y-yB|=d. Given the distances deltaX and deltaY, if d equals deltaX + deltaY, I've realized that in
tersection points correspond to boundaries of the diamonds and can be found through rational coordinates when using integer inputs. I can compute explicit formu
las for these intersections, and I’ve validated them with a sample case.
**Exploring triangle configurations**

I'm analyzing how to form equilateral triangles using points defined by coordinates (dx,dy) with certain conditions. For each pair of dx and dy, I can determine
 triangle sides based on those values. However, many computations may skip due to insufficient points. To simplify this, I think about transforming coordinates,
 changing L1 circles into L∞ squares, which reveals a more structured approach. This transformation helps identify equilateral triangles based on corner positio
ns in a square. In the (u,v) grid, I’ll count triples forming equilateral triangles by filtering points according to parity.

I’ve implemented a Python solution that:

- Maps each cow position \((x,y)\) to transformed coordinates \((u=x+y-2,\;v=x-y+N-1)\).
- Uses bitsets per \(u\)-row to represent occupied \(v\) positions.
- Counts all equilateral triples by scanning for 3-corner and 4-corner axis-aligned squares in the \((u,v)\) L∞ view:
  - Squares with exactly 3 corners contribute 1 triangle.
  - Full 4-corner squares contribute 4 triangles.
- Runs in \(O(U^2)\) bitwise operations (\(U\approx2N\le600\)), easily within limits.

The final count is printed from `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like tests or further tweaks!
