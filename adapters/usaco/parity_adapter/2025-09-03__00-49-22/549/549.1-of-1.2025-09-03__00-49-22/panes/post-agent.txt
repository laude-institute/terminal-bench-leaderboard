[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and Bessie the cow love to exchange math puzzles in their free time.
The last puzzle FJ gave Bessie was quite difficult and she failed to solve it.
Now she wants to get even with FJ by giving him a challenging puzzle.
Bessie gives FJ the expression $(B+E+S+S+I+E)(G+O+E+S)(M+O+O)$, containing the
seven variables $B,E,S,I,G,O,M$ (the "$O$" is a variable, not a zero).  For each
variable, she gives FJ a list of up to 500 integer values the variable can
possibly take.  She asks FJ to count the number of different ways he can assign
values to the variables so the entire expression evaluates to a multiple of 7.
Note that the answer to this problem can be too large to fit into a 32-bit
integer, so you probably want to use 64-bit integers (e.g., "long long"s in C or
C++).
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input contains an integer $N$.  The next $N$ lines each
contain a variable and a possible value for that variable.  Each variable will
appear in this list at least once and at most 500 times. No possible value will
be listed more than once for the same variable. All possible values will be in
the range $-10^5$ to $10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single integer, giving the number of ways FJ can assign values to
variables so the expression above evaluates to a multiple of 7.

SAMPLE INPUT:10
B 2
E 5
S 7
I 10
O 16
M 19
B 3
G 1
I 9
M 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 2

The two possible assignments are

(B,E,S,I,G,O,M) = (2, 5, 7, 9,  1, 16, 19) -> 51,765
                = (2, 5, 7, 9,  1, 16, 2 ) -> 34,510

**Analyzing the problem and solution**

The user wants me to break down the task into clear steps: restate the problem simply, conceptualize the solution, write the pseudocode, and then save it as a P
ython file.

I see that I need to work with Python 3 without using any outside libraries, focusing on built-in functions. The challenge involves handling significant variabl
e combinations, but since we’re focusing on sums modulo 7, I'll precompute the possible value distributions for each variable's modulo. This will simplify the c
ount of assignments that produce the desired product.
**Detailing the approach for the solution**

I see that each variable domain is close to 500, but applying mod 7 reduces them to 7 classes. For the first bracket, I’ll compute distributions by iterating ov
er possible values for each variable while applying the mod appropriately. This will result in efficient counting.

I’ll also handle the input parsing for variables and ensure I transform lists into counts, with special attention to edge cases, like variables appearing multip
le times. After completing the tasks, I’ll create the `solution.py` file without needing to test or run it.
**Preparing the solution outline**

I need to restate the problem clearly: there are 7 variables, each with possible integer values, and I want to count assignments so that the product of three su
ms is divisible by 7.

For the conceptual solution, I'll focus on using modulo 7 properties to count distributions and compute possible sums. Next, I’ll draft the pseudocode based on
that approach and handle potential edge cases.

After laying out these steps, I can proceed to create the `solution.py` file and communicate the implementation without needing prior planning or testing.

**Evaluating dependencies in counting**

I realize we shouldn't assume independence when counting X, Y, and Z, since the E and S variables appear in both sums. It's crucial to consider these dependenci
es. A more effective way might be using dynamic programming across the variables. I could track partial sums mod 7 for the three sums. With seven variables, tha
t gives me a state space of size 343. I need to define X, Y, and Z as functions of these variables and initialize the current sums.
**Optimizing dynamic programming**

For each variable in [B, E, S, I, G, O, M], I need to update sums based on dependencies. When processing B, only X changes, while E affects both X and Y, and so
 on. I’ll initialize a dynamic programming array and, for each variable, create a new DP state. After all variables, I'll sum up ways where the product of sums
modulo 7 equals zero. Precomputing residue counts helps streamline the process, making it manageable. This approach is more efficient than brute force, so it ac
complishes the goal effectively.
**Implementing solution**

I’m beginning to structure my approach, starting with reading N and mapping variable characters to lists of values. Then, I plan to precompute counts for each v
ariable by residue and set up a dynamic programming array of size 7x7x7. As I go through each variable, I’ll focus on calculating contributions and updating the
 new DP array. At the end, I’ll sum states where any of the sums is zero. This will help me count the assignments where the product of the three sums is divisib
le by seven. Now, I'll implement this in the solution.py file.

**Defining problem solution steps**

The user wants to work through a problem step by step. First, I need to restate the problem in plain language, then conceptualize a solution similarly. After th
at, I’ll draft pseudocode and finally save everything into a file named solution.py, making sure it only uses pure Python 3 without any outside libraries.

I’ll also consider dynamic programming and counting with modulo classes, particularly using modulo 7, since that's manageable. I need to keep in mind to structu
re lists for the variables: B, E, S, I, G, O, M.
**Counting combinations for modulo 7**

I’m computing all possible values modulo 7 for three groups of variables. Group 1 consists of B + 2E + 2S + I, Group 2 is G + O + E + S, and Group 3 is M + 2O.
I need to count combinations of assignments for these variables such that the product of their sums equals zero modulo 7.

Given overlaps in E, S, and O across groups, brute-force isn't feasible due to high computational costs. Instead, I can use dynamic programming or better counti
ng strategies by precomputing pairs of E and S residues. I'll keep track of the independent counts for subsidiaries and ensure I focus on how to combine those e
ffectively!
**Writing the Python code**

I'm preparing to write some Python code that processes input to count variable occurrences modulo 7. I’ll read the data, initialize counts, and calculate all ne
cessary combinations based on group dependencies.

While looping through input, I need to ensure that values are always between 0 and 6 using modulo operations appropriately. I'll build a structure to precompute
 options for various residue values and compute a final result based on those counts. After finishing the code, I will save everything in a file named solution.
py.
**Constructing the patch for solution.py**

I'm preparing to create a patch for the solution.py file. The code will handle input, initialize counts for variables with respect to modulo 7, and read values
effectively. I’ll compute the total combinations based on residue values and ensure calculations for each group sum.

I'll also account for overlaps among variables and finally print the resulting count. Once the patch is ready, I'll apply it to finalize everything and ensure i
t's set up correctly for execution. Let's proceed with applying the patch!

**Structuring Python Solution Steps**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution to a problem, and I’ll break it down into four parts: first, I'll restate the problem in plain language. Then, I'll
conceptualize a potential solution. After that, I’ll provide pseudocode to outline the logic. Finally, I’ll create the actual code in a file named solution.py.
It’s clear that I can create this file while following the instructions for how to structure the response.
**Implementing Python Code Logic**

I'm working on implementing a Python solution based on the provided algorithm. First, I need to structure the logic into the code, which includes nested loops a
nd calculations based on modular arithmetic. I’ll calculate totals and bad cases by iterating through defined ranges and checking conditions. Once I have everyt
hing prepared, I’ll create the solution.py file and ensure it includes the necessary entry point for execution. My next step is to apply the patch for saving th
is file.

[2025-09-03T05:34:18] codex

I’ve added `solution.py` with a Python implementation that:

- Parses input and tallies residues mod 7 for each variable.
- Computes total assignments minus those where all three factors are nonzero mod 7.
- Outputs the count of assignments making the product divisible by 7.

Let me know if you’d like to test it or review any part!
