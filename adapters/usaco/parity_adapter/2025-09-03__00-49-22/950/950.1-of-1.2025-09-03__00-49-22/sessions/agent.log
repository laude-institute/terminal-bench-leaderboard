[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes sightseeing, and today she is looking for scenic valleys.

Of interest is an $N \times N$ grid of cells, where each cell has a height.
Every cell outside this square grid can be considered to have infinite height.

A valley is a region of this grid which is contiguous, has no holes, and is such
that every cell immediately surrounding it is higher than all cells in the
region.

More formally:
 A set of cells is called "edgewise-contiguous" if one can reach any cell of
the set from any other by a sequence of moves up, down, left, or right. A set of cells is called "pointwise-contiguous" if one can reach any cell
of the set from any other by a sequence of moves up, down, left, right, or
diagonally. A "region" is a non-empty edgewise-contiguous set of
cells.  A region is called "holey" if the complement of the region
(which includes the infinite cells outside the $N \times N$ grid) is not
pointwise-contiguous.  The "border" of a region is the set of cells
orthogonally adjacent (up, down,   left, or right) to some cell  in the region,
but which is not in the region itself.  A "valley" is any non-holey
region such that every cell in the region has height lower than every cell on
the region's border.
Bessie's goal is to determine the sum of the sizes of all valleys.

Examples
This is a region:

oo.
ooo
..o
This is not a region (the middle cell and the lower-right cell are not
edgewise-contiguous):

oo.
oo.
..o
This is a non-holey region:

ooo
o..
o..
This is a holey region (the single cell within the "donut" shape is not
pointwise-contiguous with the "outside" of the region):

ooo
o.o
ooo
This is another non-holey region (the single cell in the enter is
pointwise-contiguous with the cell in the lower-right corner):

ooo
o.o
oo.

INPUT FORMAT:
First line contains integer $N$, where $1 \le N \le 750$.

Next $N$ lines each contain $N$ integers, the heights of the cells of the grid.
Each height $h$ will satisfy $1 \le h \le 10^6$. Every height will be a distinct
integer.

In at least 19% of the test cases, it is further guaranteed that $N \leq 100$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer, the sum of the sizes of all valleys.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
1 10 2
20 100 30
3 11 50
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
30

In this example, there are three valleys of size 1:

o.o
...
o..
One valley of size 2:

...
...
oo.
One valley of size 3:

ooo
...
...
One valley of size 6:

ooo
o..
oo.
One valley of size 7:

ooo
o.o
oo.
And one valley of size 9:

ooo
ooo
ooo
Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30.

**Analyzing valley regions**

I need to count the total size of all "valley" regions. A valley region is defined as an edge-connected group of cells that is non-holey, meaning it doesn't have holes and has a maximum height that is lower than the minimum height of its border cells. Since the outside grid is infinitely high, regions touching the boundary won't disqualify them as valleys. Essentially, every cell in a valley has a height lower than every border cell, meaning all regions could be classified as valleys.
**Counting valley regions**

If the border has infinite heights, then regions qualify as valleys if they are non-holey. Almost all regions likely fit this definition. However, the entire grid itself is a non-holey region of size N^2. The complement includes infinite outer cells, which are pointwise connected, confirming that the full grid is indeed a valley. So, counting all subsets of connected cells, I realize valleys can have diverse overlapping shapes. Essentially, I need to calculate the sum of sizes of all valley regions using a combinatorial approach that recognizes connected subgraphs under these specific conditions.
**Counting connected components**

At each height level, I need to consider the connected components made up of cells that are non-holey and have heights less than the neighboring border heights. Initially, I start with a forest of components at the lowest heights, and as higher cells are added, some regions may become surrounded by taller cells, potentially creating holes.

So, I’ll track these components as I analyze thresholds in height, combining any overlapping regions while maintaining a record of their sizes and ensuring they remain non-holey. Only components without holes will be counted for their sizes at each threshold. This requires careful management of component connectivity and conditions as heights increase.
**Summing sizes of non-holey components**

To find the total sizes of non-holey components, I'll sum the sizes of each component formed at each height threshold. This process involves sorting the cells by height and using a union-find data structure to manage active sets of cells, keeping track of their sizes and holey status. 

A component is considered holey if it encloses inactive cells, so I must ensure that the active component remains tree-like, meaning it has no cycles. By maintaining counts of vertices and edges in each component, I can determine if a component is non-holey before adding its size to the total.

**Exploring valley identification**

I'm trying to identify all valleys, which are contiguous regions lower than the surrounding border cells and have no holes. It looks like I need to count the sizes of these valleys, possibly using a method like Union-Find while processing heights in decreasing order. I want to focus on connected components that form local minima and ensure that their heights are less than the border heights. I think I’m also considering how to manage flooding scenarios for a more comprehensive view of the cell dynamics.
**Analyzing valley conditions**

I'm observing how to define a valley in terms of a region R. The max height inside (M) must be less than the minimal border height (B) for it to be considered a valley, and it shouldn't have any holes. To approach this, I think sorting cells in decreasing order and using a union-find structure will work well. As I add cells, I'll track active components and update their border heights accordingly. This way, I can determine if the conditions for flooding are met based on the heights and their connectivity.
**Addressing valley counting**

I'm considering how to count all valleys in a grid, not just the global valley. Unlike what might seem like O(N^2) complexity, I need a dynamic programming approach. Every region that qualifies as a valley must be edgewise contiguous, hole-free, and have its maximum height lower than all its adjacent border heights.

The challenge is that the number of connected sub-regions is vast, but the goal is just to find the sizes of all valleys without listing them all. Each unique configuration of lower cells that fits the criteria will contribute to the total valley count, which seems manageable despite the potential combinatorial explosion!
**Planning valley detection**

I'm considering starting a BFS from all boundary cells outside the grid, treating them as a super-node. I'll check in all eight directions for unvisited cells. If I find any cell in the grid that hasn’t been reached, it indicates a hole, and I should skip that valley since it wouldn't qualify.

The complexity might seem high, with a worst-case scenario of N^2 valleys, but it could be feasible with a good DSU approach. I'll focus instead on checking if components touch the boundary to streamline hole detection, since this could affect the connectivity result. Ultimately, I'll simplify my response into conceptual insights and provide pseudocode, even if I'll need to adapt the actual implementation later.

I'm considering starting a BFS from all boundary cells outside the grid, treating them as a super-node. I'll check in all eight directions for unvisited cells. If I find any cell in the grid that hasn’t been reached, it indicates a hole, and I should skip that valley since it wouldn't qualify.

The complexity might seem high, with a worst-case scenario of N^2 valleys, but it could be feasible with a good DSU approach. I'll focus instead on checking if components touch the boundary to streamline hole detection, since this could affect the connectivity result. Ultimately, I'll simplify my response into conceptual insights and provide pseudocode, even if I'll need to adapt the actual implementation later.

Here’s the solution:

**Restatement**  
Given an N×N grid with distinct heights, count every non-empty edgewise-connected, hole-free region whose orthogonal neighbors all have strictly greater height, summing the sizes of these regions.

**Solution Approach**  
- Process cells in increasing height order, maintaining a DSU of cells ≤ current height.  
- Each new cell forms/joins a component; track for each component:
  - max height inside (`maxh`)
  - minimum orthogonal neighbor height outside (`minb`)
- A component at its own max height h is a valley exactly when `minb > h`.  
- When a new cell of height h is added, if its DSU root satisfies `maxh==h` and `minb>h`, add its size to the answer.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N, grid H
prepare list cells=(height,i,j), sorted ascending
init DSU on N*N items with fields sz, maxh, minb
active = [False] * (N*N)
ans = 0
for each (h,i,j) in cells:
    u = i*N+j; active[u]=True
    DSU.maxh[u]=h; DSU.minb[u]=∞
    for each orthogonal neighbor (ni,nj):
        if inside grid:
            v = ni*N+nj
            if active[v]:
                u = DSU.union(u,v)
            else:
                DSU.minb[find(u)] = min(DSU.minb[find(u)], H[ni][nj])
    r = DSU.find(u)
    if DSU.maxh[r]==h and DSU.minb[r]>h:
        ans += DSU.sz[r]
print(ans)
```
