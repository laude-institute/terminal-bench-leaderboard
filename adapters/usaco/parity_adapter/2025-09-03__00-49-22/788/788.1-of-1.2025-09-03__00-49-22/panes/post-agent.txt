[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In his spare time, Farmer John has created a new video-sharing service, which he
names MooTube.  On MooTube, Farmer John's cows can record, share, and discover
many amusing videos.  His cows already have posted $N$ videos ($1 \leq N \leq 5000$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$.  However, FJ can't
quite figure out how to help his cows find new videos they might like.

FJ wants to create a list of "suggested videos" for every MooTube video.  This
way, cows will be recommended the videos most relevant to the ones they already
watch.

FJ devises a metric of "relevance," which determines, as the name suggests, how
relevant two videos are to each other.  He picks $N-1$ pairs of videos and
manually computes their pairwise relevance.  Then, FJ visualizes his videos as a
network, where each video is a node and the $N-1$ pairs of videos he manually
considered are connected.  Conveniently, FJ has picked his $N-1$ pairs so that
any video can be  reached from any other video along a path of connections in
exactly one way. FJ decides that the relevance of any pair of videos should be
defined as the minimum relevance of any connection along this path.

Farmer John wants to pick a value $K$ so that next to any given MooTube video,
all other videos with relevance at least $K$ to that video will be suggested.
However, FJ is worried that too many videos will be suggested to his cows, which
could distract them from milk production!  Therefore, he wants to carefully set
an appropriate value of $K$.  Farmer John would like your help answering a
number of questions about the suggested videos for certain values of $K$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 5000$).

The next $N-1$ lines each describe a pair of videos FJ manually compares.  Each
line includes three integers $p_i$, $q_i$, and $r_i$
($1 \leq p_i, q_i \leq N, 1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000,000$), indicating that
videos $p_i$ and $q_i$ are connected with relevance $r_i$.

The next $Q$ lines describe Farmer John's $Q$ questions.  Each line contains two
integers, $k_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq k_i \leq 1,000,000,000, 1 \leq v_i \leq N$),
indicating that FJ's $i$th question asks how many videos will be suggested to
viewers of video $v_i$ if $K = k_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output $Q$ lines.  On line $i$, output the answer to FJ's $i$th question.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1 2 3
2 3 2
2 4 4
1 2
4 1
3 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
0
2

Farmer John finds that videos one and two have relevance three, that videos two
and three have relevance two, and that videos two and four have relevance four.
Based on this, videos one and three have relevance min(3, 2) = 2, videos one and
four have relevance min(3, 4) = 3, and videos three and four have relevance
min(2, 4) = 2.

Farmer John wants to know how many videos will be suggested from video two if
$K=1$, from video one if $K=3$, and from video one if $K=4$.  We see that with
$K=1$, videos 1, 3, and 4 will be suggested on video two.  With $K=4$, no videos
will be suggested from video one.  With $K=3$, however, videos 2 and 4 will be
suggested from video one.

**Analyzing Python solution requirements**

The user is asking for a Python3 solution that includes a problem restatement, a conceptual solution, pseudocode, and saving everything to a solution.py file. T
hey want to know how many nodes are reachable from a given node V using edges with a weight greater than or equal to K, and whether to include V in the count. G
iven the constraints of N and Q being up to 5000, I'm estimating that the worst-case operational complexity might be around 25 million, which should be manageab
le in Python.
**Clarifying Python solution strategy**

I’m evaluating how to approach the user's Python problem. Given the constraints, BFS for checking edge weights would result in about 50 million checks, which fe
els borderline for performance. I think the union-find method would be more efficient by sorting edges and queries, allowing for a manageable O((N + Q) log N) c
omplexity. The plan is to read edges, sort them, and process queries. I also want to implement a manual DSU without outside libraries. Finally, I'll ensure the
solution is saved in a solution.py file as requested.
**Planning code structure**

I’m outlining the steps for creating the solution.py file. I realize I should restate the problem, then conceptualize the solution, draft pseudocode, and finall
y present the code. Using headers for each section will help with clarity, so I'll include **Problem Restatement**, **Solution Concept**, **Pseudocode**, and **
Code**. The goal is to produce this structured content before applying the patch to create the solution.py file.  I’ll prepare the final answer with these secti
ons included.

**Problem Restatement**
- We have \(N\) videos connected in a tree by \(N-1\) edges, each edge with a “relevance” weight.
- The relevance between any two videos is the minimum edge weight along their unique path.
- Given \(Q\) queries \((K, v)\), we must count how many other videos have relevance at least \(K\) to video \(v\).

**Solution Concept**
- Offline sort edges by descending weight.
- Sort queries by descending \(K\).
- Use a Union-Find (DSU) structure with component sizes.
- As we process each query in descending \(K\), union all edges with weight ≥ \(K\).
- Then the answer for \((K, v)\) is the size of \(v\)’s component minus one (excluding \(v\) itself).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, Q
read edges list of (weight, u, v)
read queries list of (K, v, original_index)

sort edges descending by weight
sort queries descending by K

initialize DSU parent[i]=i, size[i]=1
edge_index = 0
for each query (K, v, idx) in sorted queries:
    while edge_index < len(edges) and edges[edge_index].weight >= K:
        union(edges[edge_index].u, edges[edge_index].v)
        edge_index += 1
    answer[idx] = size[find(v)] - 1

print answers in original query order
```
