[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Cow Steeplechase [Brian Dean]

Farmer John has a brilliant idea for the next great spectator sport: Cow
Steeplechase! As everyone knows, regular steeplechase involves a group of
horses that race around a course filled with obstacles they must jump over.
FJ figures the same contest should work with highly-trained cows, as long
as the obstacles are made short enough.

In order to design his course, FJ makes a diagram of all the N (1 <= N <=
250) possible obstacles he could potentially build. Each one is represented
by a line segment in the 2D plane that is parallel to the horizontal or
vertical axis. Obstacle i has distinct endpoints (X1_i, Y1_i) and (X2_i,
Y2_i) (1 <= X1_i, Y1_i, X2_i, Y2_i <= 1,000,000,000). An example is as follows:

   --+-------
-----+-----
  ---+---     |
     |     |  |
   --+-----+--+-   |
     |     |  |  | |
     |   --+--+--+-+-
           |  |  | |
              |

FJ would like to build as many of these obstacles as possible, subject to
the constraint that no two of them intersect. Starting with the diagram
above, FJ can build 7 obstacles:

   ----------
-----------
  -------     |
           |  |
           |  |    |
           |  |  | |
           |  |  | |
           |  |  | |
              |

Two segments are said to intersect if they share any point in common, even
an endpoint of one or both of the segments.  FJ is certain that no two
horizontal segments in the original input diagram will intersect, and that
similarly no two vertical segments in the input diagram will intersect.

Please help FJ determine the maximum number of obstacles he can build.

PROBLEM NAME: steeple

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains four space-separated integers
        representing an obstacle: X1_i, Y1_i, X2_i, and Y2_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
4 5 10 5
6 2 6 12
8 3 8 5

INPUT DETAILS:

There are three potential obstacles. The first is a horizontal segment
connecting (4, 5) to (10, 5); the second and third are vertical segments
connecting (6, 2) to (6, 12) and (8, 3) to (8, 5).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of non-crossing segments FJ can choose.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The optimal solution is to choose both vertical segments.

**Conceptualizing segment matching**

I'm considering a simple depth-first search matching approach due to the small size of the problem. I'll start by parsing the segments into horizontal and verti
cal classifications, ensuring normalization. Once I have that set, I’ll check intersections based on their coordinates. Next, I’ll build a bipartite graph where
 each horizontal segment indexes to the verticals it intersects with. By computing the maximum matching size with Hopcroft-Karp, I can then find the answer by s
ubtracting the match size from the total segments. I'll write this out in pseudocode and then implement it in Python.
**Planning solution steps**

I need to create a plan for delivering a solution.py file. The final deliverable requires me to restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, write pseudocod
e, and then use an application to actually create the solution.py file. Each step must be clear, and I'll organize the sections as 1) Restatement, 2) Conceptual
, 3) Pseudocode, and finally, 4) the code itself.

After that, I’ll use the relevant method to save the file, ensuring each part is handled in order. Let's proceed with drafting those sections before implementin
g the final code.
**Restating the problem**

I need to find the maximum subset of segments where no segments intersect from a given set of axis-aligned segments. Horizontal segments won't intersect with ea
ch other, and the same goes for vertical segments; the only intersections I need to consider are those between horizontal and vertical segments.

**Conceptualizing the solution**

I can model this as a bipartite graph, where one set represents horizontal segments and the other set represents vertical segments. An edge would exist if two s
egments intersect. The maximum number of non-intersecting segments can then be found by subtracting the maximum matching size from the total number of segments.

**Pseudocode outline**

Next, I’ll implement the pseudocode, detailing the reading of input, creating adjacency lists, and applying the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to compute the maximum m
atching and print the result. This plan should handle up to 250 segments and large coordinates without overflow issues. Now, I’ll proceed to apply the patch to
create the solution.py file.

**Solving segment intersections**

The user wants to solve the maximum number of non-crossing segments, which are horizontal or vertical and defined on a coordinate system. I recognize that this
is a maximum independent set problem in a bipartite graph where horizontal segments correspond to one set and vertical to another. The edges exist if they inter
sect. I’ll aim to maximize the segments chosen without adjacency, applying König's theorem to find the solution through matching techniques. Brute force checkin
g pairs seems feasible given the constraints.
**Planning the solution steps**

To tackle the problem, I’ll first read the number of segments, N. I’ll determine if each segment is horizontal or vertical and store them accordingly. Next, I’l
l check for intersections between horizontal and vertical segments and build an adjacency list representing these relationships.

Then, I’ll use a DFS-based algorithm to compute the maximum matching since N is small, making this approach feasible. Finally, I’ll prepare a response that incl
udes a restatement of the problem in plain English, a conceptualization of the solution, and the pseudocode, before saving the code to a file.
**Preparing the solution**

I’ll first structure my message clearly by restating the problem, followed by a conceptual solution, and then providing the pseudocode before creating the solut
ion file.

The code will read the number of segments from standard input, classify them as horizontal or vertical, and build an adjacency list representing their intersect
ions. I’ll use a depth-first search to find maximum matching in a bipartite graph, ultimately printing the number of segment pairs that can be selected without
intersection.

Now, I'll generate the code for solution.py and apply the patch accordingly.

**Planning the solution**

It looks like I'm tackling a problem involving Farmer John and segments on a coordinate grid. First, I need to restate the problem clearly: we have N axis-align
ed segments, and no two segments—whether horizontal or vertical—intersect. The goal is to find the maximum number of segments such that none intersect.

Next, I’ll conceptualize a solution using the maximum independent set in a bipartite graph approach. Finally, I need to document this in pseudocode and save it
as a file called solution.py.
**Drafting solution steps**

I need to write a plan for implementing the solution in Python. First off, I’ll write pseudocode and then create a file called solution.py. My approach involves
 parsing input, separating segments, building a graph, and using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to compute the maximum matching.

I’ll restate the problem clearly, conceptualize a solution, and then write out pseudocode before saving everything in solution.py. I'll keep it straightforward,
 since it's all in one file, and follow the structure step by step.
**Constructing the solution code**

I’m working on checking conditions for segments where if y1 equals y2, I find the lower and upper x values for horizontal segments. If x1 equals x2, I find the
lower and upper y values for vertical segments. Then, I build the adjacency list based on these segments.

Next, I’ll call the Hopcroft-Karp function for maximum matching, calculate N minus the matching, and print the answer. Since N is small, I don’t need to worry m
uch about recursion depth. I’ll set up imports and implement BFS and DFS inside my solution. Finally, I’ll use the patch to save this implementation.

1. Restatement
Farmer John has N axis-aligned line segments (some horizontal, some vertical), with no two horizontals overlapping and no two verticals overlapping. He wants th
e largest set of these segments such that no horizontal crosses any vertical.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Treat each horizontal as a node on the left, each vertical as a node on the right.
- Connect a horizontal and vertical node if they intersect.
- The problem becomes choosing the maximum set of nodes with no edges between them, i.e., the maximum independent set in a bipartite graph.
- In bipartite graphs, MIS = total nodes − maximum matching.
- Build the graph in O(N²), run Hopcroft–Karp to find max matching in O(E√V), then output N − matching.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
for each segment:
  if horizontal:
    normalize x1≤x2, store (x1,x2,y) in horizontals
  else:
    normalize y1≤y2, store (x,y1,y2) in verticals

build adjacency list adj for each horizontal:
  for each vertical:
    if horizontal.x1 ≤ vertical.x ≤ horizontal.x2
       and vertical.y1 ≤ horizontal.y ≤ vertical.y2:
      add edge

matching = hopcroft_karp(adj, num_horizontals, num_verticals)
print(N − matching)
```

4. I’ve saved the fully working solution in `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and feed the input via STDIN.
