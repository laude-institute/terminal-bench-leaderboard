[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John owns a family-run farm that has been passed down over several
generations, with a herd of cows whose familial roots can similarly be traced
back several generations on the same farm.  By examining old records, Farmer
John is curious how the cows in his current herd are related to each-other.
Please help him in this endeavor!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$) followed by the names
of two cows.  Cow names are each strings of at most 10 uppercase letters
($A \ldots Z$). Farmer John is curious about the relationship between the two
cows on this line of input.  

The next $N$ lines each contain two cow names $X$ and $Y$, indicating that $X$
is the mother of $Y$.  

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You should print one line of output indicating the relationship between the two
cows specified on the first line of input (for simplicity, let's call these two
cows BESSIE and ELSIE for the examples below).  Here are the different types of
relationships that are possible:
You should output "SIBLINGS" if BESSIE and ELSIE have the same mother.BESSIE might be a direct descendant of ELSIE, meaning that ELSIE is either
the mother, grand-mother, great-grand-mother, great-great-grand-mother, etc., of
BESSIE. If this is the case, you should print "ELSIE is the (relation) of
BESSIE", where (relation) is the appropriate relationship, for example
"great-great-grand-mother".If ELSIE is a child of an ancestor of
BESSIE (and ELSIE is not herself an ancestor or sister of BESSIE), then ELSIE is BESSIE's aunt.
You should output "ELSIE is the aunt of
BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's grand-mother, "ELSIE is the great-aunt
of BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's great-grand-mother, "ELSIE is the
great-great-aunt of BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's
great-great-grand-mother, and so on.If BESSIE and ELSIE are related by
any other means (i.e., if they share a common ancestor), they are cousins, and
you should simply output "COUSINS".You should output "NOT RELATED" if

**Defining cow relationships**

The user wants to identify relationships between two cows based on a mother-child list. First, I’ll restate the problem in straightforward English: We need to determine if two cows are siblings, direct ancestors, aunts or great-aunts, cousins, or unrelated. Then, I’ll conceptualize a solution and write pseudocode for how to implement it. Finally, I’ll save the code in a file named `solution.py`, which means I’ll need to create that file with the appropriate relationship logic inside.
**Conceptualizing cow relationships**

To solve the problem, I'll read inputs for the names of two cows and build a mapping of mother-child relationships. Then, I’ll create an ancestry chain for each cow by following their mother links up until there are no more mothers. I’ll check if they share a mother to determine sibling status, or find ancestor links to identify other relationships like aunts or cousins. Finally, I’ll format the output to show the relationship clearly, respecting the order of the cows' names.
**Implementing cow relationships**

When determining cow relationships, I’ll consider both directions for direct ancestors. For instance, if the second cow is an ancestor of the first, I'll state, "{second} is the ... of {first}." For siblings, cousins, and unrelated cases, the order doesn’t matter.

I’ll read input data to document mother-child relationships, build ancestor chains, and check for relationships like siblings, aunts, and cousins with corresponding output. Finally, I'll format the relationships correctly, using appropriate hyphenations, and then save the code as `solution.py`.

**Clarifying cow relationships**

I need to establish the relationships among cows based on maternal ties. First, I'll read in the names of two cows, A and B, and build a parent dictionary where each cow points to its mother. The goal is to determine whether they are siblings or if one is a descendant of the other. I’ll check if they share the same mother for sibling status or trace the lineage from one to the other for the descendant relationship.
**Defining familial relationships**

I'm exploring how to identify different relationships between cows based on their maternal lineage. For instance, if Bessie has a relative Elsie who is the child of a grandmother, Elsie would be labeled as an aunt. Similarly, if Elsie is linked to a deeper ancestor, she could be called a great-aunt, depending on how many generations separate them. If they share a common ancestor without being siblings, they would be classified as cousins. However, it seems the first cow is always the input cow.
**Decoding cow relationships**

I'm analyzing a sample input about cow relationships, where the first line indicates two cows: AA and BB. The output indicates that BB is AA's great-aunt. To clarify, I need to establish the maternal hierarchy and determine the relationships based on the ancestor chain.

I’ll compare cow AA to BB first and check connections backward, moving through their respective branches. If I find common links, I can identify whether they are siblings, cousins, or not related. Importantly, I need to ensure I categorize correctly, especially regarding aunts or ancestors.

**Problem Restatement**
Given a list of mother–child pairs defining a maternal family tree, determine how two specified cows are related: siblings, direct ancestor (mother, grand-mother, great-…-grand-mother), aunt (…, great-aunt, great-…-aunt), cousins, or not related.

**Solution Outline**
- Read input and build a `parent` map from child to mother.
- Generate each cow’s ancestor chain by repeatedly following the `parent` links.
- Check, in order:
  1. Siblings: same mother.
  2. Direct ancestor: one cow appears in the other’s ancestor chain (compute generation depth for the proper “mother”/“grand-mother”/“great-…” label).
  3. Aunt: one cow’s mother is an ancestor (depth ≥2) of the other.
  4. Cousins: they share any ancestor.
  5. Not related otherwise.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, cow1, cow2
build parent[child] = mother for N pairs

function get_ancestors(cow):
    list = []
    while cow has a parent:
        cow = parent[cow]
        append cow to list
    return list

anc1 = get_ancestors(cow1)
anc2 = get_ancestors(cow2)

if parent[cow1] == parent[cow2] != None:
    print "SIBLINGS" and exit

if cow2 in anc1:
    depth = index_of(cow2 in anc1) + 1
    relation = format_ancestor(depth)
    print "{cow2} is the {relation} of {cow1}"
    exit

if cow1 in anc2:
    depth = index_of(cow1 in anc2) + 1
    relation = format_ancestor(depth)
    print similarly and exit

for each anc at depth d in anc1 (d>=2):
    if parent[cow2] == anc:
        relation = format_aunt(d)
        print "{cow2} is the {relation} of {cow1}" and exit

repeat swapped for cow1 aunt of cow2

if any common ancestor between anc1 and anc2:
    print "COUSINS"
else:
    print "NOT RELATED"
```

The helper `format_ancestor` builds “mother”, “grand-mother”, or “great-…-grand-mother”; `format_aunt` similarly builds “aunt” or “great-…-aunt”.

The full implementation is saved below.

```bash
ls solution.py
```

This script reads from standard input and writes the correct relationship to standard output.
