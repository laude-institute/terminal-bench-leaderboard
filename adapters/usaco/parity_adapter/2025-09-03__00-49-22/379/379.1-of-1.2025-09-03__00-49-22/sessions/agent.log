[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second. 
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down. 
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

PROBLEM NAME: slowdown

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The value of N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line is of the form "T x" or "D x", indicating a
        time event or a distance event.  In both cases, x is an
        integer that is guaranteed to place the event before Bessie
        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for
        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to
        slow down quite a bit all at once.  Events may not be listed
        in order.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
T 30
D 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2970

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds. 
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her
980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.

**Implementing event simulation**

I’m working on a solution to parse events and sort them based on when they occur, distinguishing between time-based and distance-based events. Bessie starts at time=0, distance=0, with a speed influenced by the slow_count. Each event increases slow_count, and both types of events depend on her progress. I need to manage these events in chronological order, evaluating the next occurring time-event and distance-event to determine what happens next in the simulation.
**Advancing through slowdowns**

I’m focusing on how to advance to the next slowdown by analyzing upcoming events. For the time slowdown at T, I need to calculate what distance Bessie will cover by then. If T is greater than the current time, I can figure out the time until that event and the distance she'd cover. 

For the distance slowdown at D, I'll determine time to reach it based on the speed. I should compute future times for each candidate event and select the minimum. If they occur simultaneously, I’ll process all events at that time, ensuring we keep track of sorted lists for efficiency.
**Simulating event timing**

I’m working on an approach to handle multiple time events occurring simultaneously, ensuring I process them in the correct simulation order. For any time event, it triggers when simulation time equals that event, while distance events activate when Bessie reaches a certain distance. I need to calculate the event times dynamically and choose the one that occurs first. 

Since Bessie can slow down due to events, I’ll maintain two sorted lists for efficient management. I'll also account for edge cases and round the final time when she finishes her race.

**Restatement**
Compute how long Bessie takes to ski 1000 m, starting at 1 m/s and slowing down (to 1/2, 1/3, … m/s) at specified times or distances.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Maintain current time `t`, distance `d`, and slowdown count `k` (so speed = 1/(k+1)).
- Keep two sorted lists: time-events and distance-events.
- In each step, compute:
  - When the next time-event occurs (`t_T`).
  - When the next distance-event occurs (`t_D` = current `t` + distance gap / speed).
  - When the finish occurs (`t_finish`).
- Advance to whichever happens first:
  - If finish first, stop.
  - Else advance `t` and `d`, then process all events at that moment, incrementing `k` for each.
- Repeat until `d` ≥ 1000, then round the final `t` to nearest integer (with 0.5 up).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
split events into time_events[], dist_events[]
sort both lists
t = 0.0; d = 0.0; slow = 0
iT = iD = 0
while d < 1000:
    speed = 1/(slow+1)
    next_T = time_events[iT] or inf
    next_D = dist_events[iD] or inf
    t_T = next_T
    t_D = t + (next_D - d)/speed if next_D<inf else inf
    t_finish = t + (1000-d)/speed
    next_t = min(t_T, t_D, t_finish)
    if next_t >= t_finish: t = t_finish; break
    dt = next_t - t
    d += dt * speed
    t = next_t
    while time_events[iT] == t: slow++; iT++
    while dist_events[iD] ≈ d: slow++; iD++
result = round(t)
print result
```
