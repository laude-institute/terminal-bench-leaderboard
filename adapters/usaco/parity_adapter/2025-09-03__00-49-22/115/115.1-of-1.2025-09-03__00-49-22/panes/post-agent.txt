[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Overplanting (Silver) [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John has purchased a new machine that is capable of planting grass
within any rectangular region of his farm that is "axially aligned" (i.e.,
with vertical and horizontal sides).  Unfortunately, the machine
malfunctions one day and plants grass in not one, but N (1 <= N <= 1000)
different rectangular regions, some of which may even overlap.

Given the rectangular regions planted with grass, please help FJ compute
the total area in his farm that is now covered with grass.

PROBLEM NAME: planting

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains four space-separated integers x1 y1
        x2 y2 specifying a rectangular region with upper-left corner
        (x1,y1) and lower-right corner (x2,y2).  All coordinates are
        in the range -10^8...10^8.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
0 5 4 1
2 4 6 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total area covered by grass.  Note that this could be
        too large to fit into a 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

20

**Clarifying Overplanting problem**

The user wants to tackle the Overplanting problem, focusing on computing the union area of up to 1000 rectangles that are axis-aligned and can have large coordi
nate ranges across both positive and negative values. I need to clearly state the problem, conceptualize how to solve it, write pseudocode, and then implement t
he solution in Python without using external libraries. Given the constraints, a line sweep method with coordinate compression seems like a feasible plan, where
 I account for coverage through events.
**Exploring coverage calculation**

I’m considering using either a segment tree or a simpler data structure, like an array, to keep track of y-interval coverage since there are around 2000 unique
y intervals. I can maintain a counts array for coverage and a parallel length array for segments when coverage is greater than zero. For each event, I can updat
e the array efficiently over the relevant y indices and compute the total covered length. Given the constraints, this approach balances simplicity and efficienc
y for implementation in Python. I'll need to outline this in my problem restatement and pseudocode before diving into the coding part.

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing a line-sweep with coordinate compression to compute the union area of rectangles. It reads input, creates edge events, com
presses y-coordinates, and maintains active segment counts to accumulate area. Let me know if you’d like any tests or further explanation!
