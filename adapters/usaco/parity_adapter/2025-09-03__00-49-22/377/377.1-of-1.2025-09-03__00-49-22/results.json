She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second. \nHowever, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down. \nEach time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter\nper second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing\ndown twice, and so on.\n\nYou are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of\nevents.  An event like this:\n\nT 17\n\nmeans that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into\nthe race.  An event like this:\n\nD 10\n\nmeans that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in\nthis case, 10 meters.\n\nGiven a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount\nof time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your\nanswer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).\n\nPROBLEM NAME: slowdown\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The value of N.\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: Each line is of the form \"T x\" or \"D x\", indicating a\n        time event or a distance event.  In both cases, x is an\n        integer that is guaranteed to place the event before Bessie\n        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for\n        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to\n        slow down quite a bit all at once.  Events may not be listed\n        in order.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n2\nT 30\nD 10\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nBessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n2970\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nBessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds. \nShe then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the\nnext 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down\nagain to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her\n980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
