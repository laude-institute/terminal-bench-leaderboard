[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second. 
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down. 
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

PROBLEM NAME: slowdown

INPUT FORMAT:

        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for
        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds. 
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her

**Simulating race events**

I need to determine the timing and distance for events during a race. The distance events depend on speed, and time events depend on the simulation's state, making it a bit messy. It's crucial that I simulate the race by managing whichever event happens first: either the next time or distance event. A better approach would be to convert all events into actual "distance for slowdown" and "time for slowdown," ensuring events trigger at absolute distances and times from the start.
**Processing race events**

I need to handle events in the order they occur in reality, whether it's the next time event or the next distance event based on current speed. To organize this, I could use a priority queue for events, with each event having a trigger point in either time or distance. The current state includes elapsed time, distance covered, and speed. I'll compare the upcoming events and update the state accordingly, considering what happens first and handling potential simultaneous events as needed until reaching the total distance.
**Preparing to implement the solution**

I need to handle distance events carefully, since the current distance is a float while the next distance can be an integer. Comparing them directly is feasible if I store the float accurately. Given the more events, the speed factor is an integer, ensuring distance calculations remain precise. I'll write a pseudocode version in plain English before coding, then create a script to read input, process the events, and output the answer. Now, I'm ready to write the solution in the new script.

**Processing event order**

I'm thinking I need to process events both chronologically and spatially. Events triggered by either time or distance seem a bit like mixing two different streams. One way to handle this could be to keep track of the current time and distance covered. I also need to fetch the next events: one for time and one for distance. To determine their occurrences, I’ll compute the time for both, especially focusing on how to get the time for the next distance event.
**Finding the earliest events**

I need to determine the earliest event by calculating the time for both the next time event and the next distance event. If the next time event occurs first, I'll process it and calculate how much distance Bessie travels until then, capping it at 1000 meters if needed. However, I need to ensure that the time events are sorted, as input events may not be. I also need to account for cases where events might occur simultaneously, so I'll prepare to handle multiple slowdowns at the same time accordingly.
**Processing time and distance events**

Before I process a time event, I should compute the travel during the time interval and update the current distance. After that, I'll set the current time to the next time event and handle all time events occurring at this moment. I must also check for distance events that may occur simultaneously, paying special attention to exact distances. To address precision issues with floating-point calculations, I think using rational numbers might be safer to prevent cumulative errors. I'll implement this using fractions to maintain accuracy throughout.

**Simulating events**

I need to simulate events based on time and distance, merging them effectively. Time events trigger when a global clock reaches specific times, while distance events activate when a certain distance is traveled. Bessie’s speed will change piecewise, starting at a speed of 1 and adjusting for slowdowns. At t=0 and d=0, I’ll manage two sets of events: those sorted by time (T_i) and distance (D_j). Then, I’ll calculate which event occurs first during each simulation step.
**Simulating event dynamics**

I’m considering how to calculate the next potential event by figuring out a few things. First, I’ll determine the time until the next time event and the distance Bessie would travel during that time. Then, I’ll check the distance to the next distance event and calculate how long it takes to cover it at her current speed. 

If the time event happens first, I’ll advance time accordingly, update Bessie’s distance and speed, and remove that event. If the distance event happens first, I’ll update the distance and time instead. I should be mindful of simultaneous events, which could require special handling. To keep everything organized, I’ll build a single list of events and process them chronologically, allowing for dynamic merging as her speed changes.
**Handling simultaneous events**

When multiple time events have the same value, they’ll be adjacent in the sorted list, but I’ll only process the first. After addressing a time event, if the current time matches the next event’s target, I’ll handle any further time events at that same timestamp immediately. The same goes for distance events. 

After merging, I’ll check if there are remaining distances to cover, ensuring careful handling of float comparisons to avoid precision errors. I’ll process simultaneous events by advancing time or distance based on which event comes first, and update all necessary parameters accordingly.

**Restated Problem**  
Bessie starts skiing at 1 m/s and slows down each time an event occurs—her speed becomes 1/2, then 1/3, etc. Events are either:  
- **T x**: slow down at time x seconds  
- **D x**: slow down after x meters traveled  

Given N events (unordered), all before 1000 m, compute how many seconds it takes her to travel exactly 1000 m, rounding to the nearest second (0.5 rounds up).

**Solution Sketch**  
- Separate and sort time‐based and distance‐based slowdown events.  
- Simulate Bessie’s race, tracking current time `t`, distance `d`, slowdown count `k`, and speed `1/(k+1)`.  
- At each step, compute:
  - `dt_time`: time until next time event  
  - `dt_dist`: time to reach next distance event  
- Whichever takes less time happens first—advance `t` and `d` accordingly, apply all events at that instant (could be multiple), increment `k`, and update speed.  
- Repeat until all events processed. Then cover the remaining distance to 1000 m at final speed.  
- Round the accumulated time to the nearest integer.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N
collect times[], distances[]
sort times, sort distances
initialize t=0, d=0, k=0, speed=1, it=0, id=0
while events remain:
    next_time = times[it] or ∞
    next_dist = distances[id] or ∞
    dt_time = next_time - t
    dt_dist = (next_dist - d) / speed
    if dt_time < dt_dist:
        advance by dt_time; process all time events at next_time
    elif dt_dist < dt_time:
        advance by dt_dist; process all distance events at next_dist
    else:
        advance by dt_time; process both time & distance events
    update speed = 1 / (k+1)
cover remaining (1000 - d) at current speed
output round(time)
```
