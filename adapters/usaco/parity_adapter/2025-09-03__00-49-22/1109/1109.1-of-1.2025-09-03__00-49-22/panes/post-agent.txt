[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The fence surrounding Farmer John's largest pasture has fallen into disrepair,
and he has finally decided to replace it with a new fence.

Unfortunately, as Farmer John is laying out the new fence, a large bee ends up
chasing him around the pasture, and as a result, the fence ends up following a
rather irregular path.  The fence can be described by a string of characters,
each either "N" (north), "E" (east), "S" (south),  or "W" (west).  Each
character describes a 1-meter run of the fence.  For example, if the string is
NESW, this means the fence starts by moving north for 1 meter, then east for 1
meter, then south for 1 meter, then west for  1 meter, returning to its starting
point.

The fence ends at the position where it started, and this is the only point
visited more than once by the path of the fence (and the starting point is only
re-visited once, at the end).  As a result, the fence does indeed enclose a
single connected region of the grassy pasture, even though this region could
have a rather strange shape.

Farmer John is curious if the path in which he laid the fence traveled clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the right side of the fence as one walks along the
path of the fence in the order specified by the string) or counter-clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the left side of the fence).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 20$).  Each  of
the next $N$ lines contains a string of length at least 4 and at most 100,
describing a single fence path.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $N$ fence paths described in the input, output a line containing
either "CW" (clockwise) or "CCW" (counterclockwise).

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
NESW
WSSSEENWNEESSENNNNWWWS
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
CW
CCW

**Outlining Python implementation**

The user wants to create a Python 3 solution. First, I'll restate the problem and conceptualize the solution. Then, I need to write pseudocode and save it as a
solution.py file. The main tasks involve reading an integer N and processing a series of string instructions for a closed polygon. I’ll determine its orientatio
n—clockwise or counterclockwise—using the shoelace formula for signed area. I'll calculate the area using cross products to conclude the orientation based on th
e summed values.
**Developing orientation detection**

I'm outlining a solution to determine orientation based on the closed path directions. The steps are straightforward: first, I’ll restate the problem and concep
tualize my approach. Next, I'll draft pseudocode to read input and calculate signed area using the shoelace formula.

I plan to implement this logic in a Python file called solution.py. I need to ensure accurate computations for the coordinates while checking if the resulting a
rea is negative or positive, indicating clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Let's get coding!

1. Problem restatement:
- Given a sequence of moves (N/E/S/W) forming a closed, non-self-intersecting fence path, determine if it winds clockwise (“CW”) or counter-clockwise (“CCW”).

2. Solution concept:
- Trace the path’s vertices in order.
- Compute the signed area (twice) via the shoelace formula.
- A negative signed area means the path is clockwise; positive means counter-clockwise.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read integer N
for each of N paths:
    x, y = 0, 0
    coords = [(0,0)]
    for each direction in path:
        update x, y accordingly
        append (x,y) to coords
    area2 = 0
    for each consecutive pair ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)):
        area2 += x1*y2 - x2*y1
    if area2 < 0:
        print "CW"
    else:
        print "CCW"
```

4. Implementation saved in `solution.py`.
