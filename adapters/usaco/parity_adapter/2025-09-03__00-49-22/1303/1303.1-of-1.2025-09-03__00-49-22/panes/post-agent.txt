[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, two times the default.**

Somebody has been grazing in Farmer John's $(1 \le G \le 10^5)$
private gardens! Using his expert forensic knowledge, FJ has been able to
determine the precise time each garden was grazed.  He has also determined that
there was a single cow that was responsible for every grazing incident.

In response to these crimes each of FJ's $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10^5)$
cows have provided an alibi that proves the cow was in a specific location at a
specific time.  Help FJ test whether each of these alibis demonstrates the cow's
innocence.

A cow can be determined to be innocent if it is impossible for her to have
travelled between all of the grazings and her alibi.  Cows travel at a rate of 1
unit distance per unit time.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input will contain $G$ and $N$ separated by a space.

The next $G$ lines contain the integers $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of the grazing.  It will always be possible for
a single cow to travel between all grazings.

The next $N$ lines contain $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of each cow's alibi.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer: the number of cows with alibis that prove their
innocence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
0 0 100
50 0 200
0 50 50
1000 1000 0
50 0 200
10 0 170
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

There were two grazings; the first at $(0, 0)$ at time $100$ and the
second at $(50, 0)$ at time $200$.

The first cow's alibi does not prove her innocence.  She has just enough time to
arrive at the first grazing.

The second cow's alibi does prove her innocence.  She is nowhere near any of the
grazings.

Unfortunately for the third cow, being at the scene of the crime does not prove
innocence.

Finally, the fourth cow is innocent because it's impossible to make it from her
alibi to the final grazing in time.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: $1 \le G, N \le 10^3$. Also, for both the fields and alibis,
$-10^6 \le x, y \le 10^6$ and  $0 \le t \le 10^6$. Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-09-03T06:25:43] thinking

**Considering grazing times**

I’m thinking about how to insert an alibi into a fixed sequence of grazing times. If the alibi occurs at time T, I need to find its position in the sorted list
of grazing times. I should check two distances based on the triangle inequality: first from the grazing point to the alibi, and then from the alibi to the next
grazing point. If the distances fit the constraints, adding the alibi keeps everything feasible, but I’m still pondering about the segment where the insertion h
appens.
**Evaluating alibi conditions**

I'm pondering how to handle an alibi when it's at the exact time of grazing. Essentially, the alibi needs to match the grazing position if the time difference i
s zero, meaning the cow would not be innocent under those conditions. The algorithm involves sorting grazing times and calculating the time differences as well
as distances. Since travel rate is one unit per time, I'll use Euclidean distance. However, I have to be cautious with potential integer overflow when handling
squared differences. For alibis outside the grazing range, I can streamline checks. Overall, the approach seems efficient, but I’m still questioning if the inse
rtion approach is optimal for grazing orders.
**Planning the solution steps**

I'm working through how to approach the problem, focusing on inserting an alibi into a sequence of grazing times, which can't be reordered. The grazing events m
ust remain in chronological order. When adding an alibi, I’ll just need to check the two adjacent grazing gaps. I’ll use Euclidean distance as the cow's travel
rate is one unit per time. My plan involves several steps: restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, draft pseudocode, and then save it into a Python fil
e.

For implementing this in Python, I will read inputs, sort grazing times, and use efficient searching techniques while ensuring everything runs smoothly within t
he memory limits. Finally, I can generate the patch to create the solution file. Let's move forward!

[2025-09-03T06:25:59] thinking

**Evaluating grazing sequences**

I’m considering that if it's possible for a cow to visit all grazings, I need to factor in the alibi event. If the alibi conflicts with the grazing times, it ca
n demonstrate innocence. The grazing events may not be in order, so I'll sort them by time. Given a sequence of grazings with specific times and an alibi, I mus
t determine where to insert the alibi into this schedule. Essentially, I'm checking for a route that accommodates both grazing and alibi events in chronological
 order.
**Analyzing travel feasibility**

I'm checking all consecutive pairs of events, including grazing to grazing and grazing to alibi, to see if the travel time is feasible. The right distance to us
e might be Euclidean since that's often how things are measured in a rural grid context. So, I'll determine if the distance is less than or equal to the time av
ailable.

For each alibi event, if the time is less than the first grazing, I need to check if the cow can reach it in time. If the alibi is after the last grazing, I’ll
check the distance from the last grazing to alibi. If it's between two grazing events, both distances must meet the time constraints. If there's no feasible ins
ertion point, the alibi proves innocence.
**Determining alibi feasibility**

I’m checking if a cow can be at an alibi location during a specific time while still completing grazing events, as both must happen. First, I need to sort the g
razing events by time. Then, for each alibi, I’ll find its position in relation to the grazing times.

If the alibi is before the first grazing or after the last one, I’ll check those boundaries. Using binary search helps identify where the alibi fits into the gr
azing timeline. Then, I’ll assess whether the distances and times align to determine if the alibi is valid or not, and I’ll keep track of which cows can be prov
en innocent or not!
**Preparing implementation**

I'm considering potential overflow issues with squared distances in Python, but Python handles big integers well, so that shouldn't be a problem. I need to ensu
re my time differences are non-negative, particularly around the grazing boundaries.

Next steps include restating the problem and conceptualizing the solution, followed by pseudocode. I'll prepare to save everything in a file called solution.py.
 The plan is to count innocent cows based on whether their alibi can fit into the grazing timeline. I’ll write the necessary code and apply the patch accordingl
y.

1. Restatement
We have G grazing events, each with a position and time, and N alibis (position and time). The guilty cow must visit all grazing events at their exact times, tr
aveling at speed 1. A cow’s alibi proves her innocence if it’s impossible for her to also have been at that alibi event and still make all grazings on time.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Sort the G grazing events by time.
- For each alibi, find where it would fit in the time-ordered grazing list.
- Check the travel feasibility to/from its neighboring grazing events (or just one neighbor at the start/end).
- If both segments are infeasible, the alibi proves innocence.

3. Pseudocode
```
read G, N
read list of grazings (x, y, t)
sort grazings by t
extract times[], xs[], ys[]
innocent = 0
for each alibi (x_a, y_a, t_a):
    j = first index with times[j] >= t_a
    left_ok = (j==0) or dist(g_j-1, alibi) <= t_a - times[j-1]
    right_ok = (j==G) or dist(alibi, g_j) <= times[j] - t_a
    if not (left_ok and right_ok):
        innocent += 1
print innocent
```
