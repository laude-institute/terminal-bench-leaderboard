[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Taxi [Mark Gordon, Richard Peng, 2013]

Bessie is running a taxi service for the other cows on the farm.  The
cows have been gathering at different locations along a fence of
length M (1 <= M <= 1,000,000,000).  Unfortunately, they have grown
bored with their current locations and each wish to go somewhere else
along the fence.  Bessie must pick up each of her friends at their
starting positions and drive them to their destinations.  Bessie's car
is small so she can only transport one cow in her car at a time.  Cows
can enter and exit the car instantaneously.

To save gas, Bessie would like to minimize the amount she has to
drive.  Given the starting and ending positions of each of the N cows
(1 <= N <= 100,000), determine the least amount of driving Bessie
has to do.  Bessie realizes that to save the most gas she may need to
occasionally drop a cow off at a position other than her destination.

Bessie starts at the leftmost point of the fence, position 0, and must
finish her journey at the rightmost point on the fence, position M.

PROBLEM NAME: taxi

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: N and M separated by a space.

* Lines 2..1+N: The (i+1)th line contains two space separated
        integers, s_i and t_i (0 <= s_i, t_i <= M), indicating the
        starting position and destination position of the ith cow.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 10
0 9
6 5

INPUT DETAILS:

There are two cows waiting to be transported along a fence of length 10. 
The first cow wants to go from position 0 (where Bessie starts) to position
9.  The second cow wishes to go from position 6 to position 5.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the total amount of driving
        Bessie must do.  Note that the result may not fit into a 32 bit
        integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

12

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie picks up the first cow at position 0 and drives to position 6. 
There she drops off the first cow, delivers the second cow to her
destination and returns to pick up the first cow.  She drops off the first
cow and then drives the remainder of the way to the right side of the fence.

**Analyzing trip distances**

I'm breaking this down: solving the problem involves combining forward and backward distances, plus M and any minimal reordering needed. The optimal total is found to be M plus double the sum of backward distances. Forward trips are efficiently aligned with M, hence extra distance is primarily from backward trips. I’m reflecting on a sample where backward distances add 2, so the total becomes 12. I’m curious if forward trips add extra distance, and it appears they don’t. This leads me to a seemingly minimal approach of M plus twice the sum of individual backward distances.
**Evaluating overlapping trips**

I'm considering overlapping backward trips and how to handle them. Each trip must be tackled one at a time since Bessie can only carry one cow. This means she'll have to go backwards separately for each trip. The distance calculated for backward trips is always double the difference between distances, because of the doubled journey.

For trips that overlap, like traveling from 10 to 5 and then back to pick another at 3, it’s important to figure out if Bessie can streamline her journey. I find the solution is simply M plus two times the summed differences of backward distances. The problem even suggests dropping off earlier if needed. It’s tricky, especially considering larger inputs, but there's a certain elegance to reducing it to a matching problem.
**Revisiting segment cancellation**

I'm analyzing the solution for a USACO problem that utilizes a stack to manage forward and backward segments. The goal is to match overlapping segments efficiently, allowing for cancellation. I realized I must carefully handle cases where backward segments can't fully cancel out forward ones due to Bessie’s carrying limitations. 

Ultimately, the formula manifests as M plus double the unmatched backward lengths. Each overlapping segment brings a complexity to the situation, especially for drops along the route. In essence, the task simplifies down to calculating distances based on those unmatched movement segments.
**Finalizing the solution approach**

I’m reassessing the problem and thinking about the possibility of combining backward trips, but it seems clear that they can’t cancel each other out due to Bessie’s capacity limits. This realization leads me to conclude that backward movements always add extra distance. 

So, the solution simplifies to calculating the total backward distances along with M. The final answer becomes M plus double the total of unmatched backward segments. I’ll restate the problem clearly, outline the steps, and draft the pseudocode into a solution. It’s straightforward enough that I can move directly into writing the solution!
