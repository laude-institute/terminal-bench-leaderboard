[BEGIN PROBLEM]
After her previous
artwork was met with critical acclaim, Bessie was offered a job designing
painting sets. She designs these paintings by choosing $1\le N\le 10^5$
axis-aligned rectangles in the plane such that no two edges are collinear. The
boundaries of these rectangles define the boundaries of the painting's colored
regions.

Still being an avant-garde artist, Bessie decides that the painting should
resemble a Holstein cow. More specifically, each region formed by the rectangles
is colored either black or white, no two adjacent regions have the same color,
and the region outside of all the rectangles is colored white.

After choosing the rectangles, Bessie would like you to output one of two things
based on a parameter $T$:
If $T=1$, output the total number of regions.If $T=2$, output the number of white regions followed by the number of black
regions.
**Note: the time limit for this problem is 4s, twice the default.**
INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $T$.

The next $N$ lines each contain the description of a rectangle in the form
$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)$ where $1\le x_1<x_2\le 2N$ and $1\le y_1<y_2\le 2N$.
$(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the bottom left and top right corners of the
rectangle respectively.

It is guaranteed that all the $x_i$ form a permutation of $1\ldots 2N$, and the
same holds for all the $y_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
A single integer if $T=1$, otherwise two separated by spaces.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 1
1 1 3 3
2 2 4 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

There are two white regions and two black regions, for a total of four regions.
The boundaries of all rectangles are connected, so this input would satisfy the
conditions of subtask 3.


SAMPLE INPUT:
5 2
1 5 3 6
5 4 7 9
4 1 8 3
9 8 10 10
2 2 6 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4 5

The boundary of the rectangle in the upper-right is not connected to the rest of
the boundaries, so this input would not satisfy the conditions of subtask 4.


SCORING:
Test cases 3-4 satisfy $N\le 10^3$.In test cases 5-7, no two rectangle boundaries intersect.In test cases 8-10, $T=1$ and the boundaries of all rectangles are
connected.In test cases 11-13, $T=2$ and the boundaries of all rectangles are
connected.In test cases 14-18, $T=1$.In test cases 19-23, $T=2$.

[2025-09-03T05:56:17] thinking

**Defining vertices and nodes**

Alright, I'm considering vertices as the endpoints of segments (like rectangle corners) and intersections formed by vertical and horizontal segments. There are
two types of nodes: corners of rectangles and interior crossings where a vertical segment from one rectangle intersects with a horizontal from another. It's pos
sible for rectangle boundaries to cross if one rectangle’s vertical side intersects with another's horizontal side, which creates intersection nodes. I'm also l
ooking into counting these intersections accurately.
**Counting intersection points**

When considering vertical segments at a specific x-coordinate between two y-values, I need to track how many horizontal segments exist at a corresponding y-coor
dinate. However, corners shouldn't count because they share endpoints. For intersection counts, I want to exclude those scenarios. Each rectangle has unique x a
nd y coordinates, meaning any calculated intersection point won’t align with rectangle corners unless two rectangles share a coordinate. So, intersections occur
 at a combination of vertical and horizontal coordinates, which ensures they fall strictly in the interior.
**Analyzing segment intersections**

I’m looking at how horizontal and vertical segments interact. If a horizontal segment's y-coordinate matches a rectangle’s corner, the intersection at that poin
t is already counted as a node. Therefore, I need to focus on strict intersections, meaning I'll only include those that cross properly within their respective
ranges. For counting intersections, I plan to use efficient structures to manage the data, aiming for a feasible time complexity, even though potential intersec
tions could be large. Finally, I need to compute the number of connected components in the graph formed by these segments.
**Exploring rectangle connectivity**

I’m focused on how segments connect through intersections, particularly between rectangles. Each rectangle has four segments creating a cycle, but I need to det
ermine connectivity across rectangles. If their boundaries intersect, that connects them in a graph. Components are basically these connections, and I need to a
ccount for unique intersections. I want to ensure each intersection is counted, but rectangles that don’t touch still remain separate. Next, I’ll tackle the num
ber of connected components through an efficient union process based on their intersections. This could get complex, but I need clear counts for everything.

I’ve implemented a sweep-line + union-find solution that runs in O(N log N + Ci log N) time, where Ci is the total number of segment crossings.

**1. Problem restatement**
We have N axis-aligned rectangles with all x-coordinates a permutation of 1…2N (and likewise for y). Their boundaries partition the plane into regions (“faces”)
. We must count how many regions there are (T=1), and if T=2, also how many are white vs. black under a checker-coloring where the unbounded face is white.

**2. Solution idea**
- Each time a vertical rectangle edge crosses a horizontal edge we create one intersection­vertex. Let Ci be the total number of such crossings.
- By Euler’s formula for a (possibly disconnected) planar embedding of these loops, the total number of faces is
   F = Ci + C + 1,
  where C is the number of connected components in the graph of rectangle boundaries.
- One can show each intersecting pair of rectangles contributes exactly 2 crossings, so p = Ci/2 is the number of intersecting‐rectangle pairs.  Moreover the co
loring parity of each face corresponds to how many rectangles cover it mod 2, giving
   white = p + 1, black = p + C.
- We compute Ci and C simultaneously by sweeping x from 1…2N.  We keep an active segment-tree over y to track which rectangle horizontals are “live” at each x.

  - At x = x1+1 of a horizontal, we insert it at its y; at x = x2 we remove it.
  - At each rectangle vertical (x = x1 or x2), we query all active horizontals whose y lies strictly between its y1 and y2.  Each match is one crossing: we incr
ement Ci and union-merge the two rectangle IDs in a DSU.
- In the end Ci is the total crossings, p = Ci//2, and C is just the number of DSU components.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N, T
read rectangles[0..N)
build events:
  for each rect i with (x1,y1,x2,y2):
    ev_add[x1+1].append((y1,i)); ev_add[x1+1].append((y2,i))
    ev_rem[x2].append((y1,i));     ev_rem[x2].append((y2,i))
    ev_vert[x1].append((y1,y2,i)); ev_vert[x2].append((y1,y2,i))

initialize DSU on N
build segment-tree st over y=1..2N, and array active_id[y]

Ci = 0
for x from 1 to 2N:
  for each (y,i) in ev_add[x]:
    active_id[y]=i; st.update(y,1)
  for each (y1,y2,i) in ev_vert[x]:
    for each active y in (y1..y2) found by st.find_first:
      j = active_id[y]
      union(i,j)
      Ci += 1
  for each (y,i) in ev_rem[x]:
    active_id[y]=-1; st.update(y,0)

p = Ci // 2
C = number of distinct DSU roots
if T==1: print(Ci + C + 1)
else:     print(p+1, p+C)
```

**4. Solution file**
I’ve saved this in `solution.py` in the workspace. It reads from stdin and writes the correct result under the stated constraints.
