[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Wormholes [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's hobby of conducting high-energy physics experiments on
weekends has backfired, causing N wormholes (2 <= N <= 12, N even) to
materialize on his farm, each located at a distinct point on the 2D map of
his farm.

According to his calculations, Farmer John knows that his wormholes will
form N/2 connected pairs.  For example, if wormholes A and B are connected
as a pair, then any object entering wormhole A will exit wormhole B moving
in the same direction, and any object entering wormhole B will similarly
exit from wormhole A moving in the same direction.  This can have rather
unpleasant consequences.  For example, suppose there are two paired
wormholes A at (0,0) and B at (1,0), and that Bessie the cow starts from
position (1/2,0) moving in the +x direction.  Bessie will enter wormhole B,
exit from A, then enter B again, and so on, getting trapped in an infinite
cycle!

Farmer John knows the exact location of each wormhole on his farm.  He
knows that Bessie the cow always walks in the +x direction, although he
does not remember where Bessie is currently located.  Please help Farmer
John count the number of distinct pairings of the wormholes such that
Bessie could possibly get trapped in an infinite cycle if she starts from
an unlucky position.

PROBLEM NAME: wormhole

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of wormholes, N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains two space-separated integers
        describing the (x,y) coordinates of a single wormhole.  Each
        coordinate is in the range 0..1,000,000,000.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 wormholes, forming the corners of a square.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of distinct pairings of wormholes such that
        Bessie could conceivably get stuck in a cycle walking from
        some starting point in the +x direction.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If we number the wormholes 1..4, then by pairing 1 with 2 and 3 with 4,
Bessie can get stuck if she starts anywhere between (0,0) and (1,0) or
between (0,1) and (1,1).  Similarly, with the same starting points, Bessie
can get stuck in a cycle if the pairings are 1-3 and 2-4.  Only the
pairings 1-4 and 2-3 allow Bessie to walk in the +x direction from any
point in the 2D plane with no danger of cycling.

[2025-09-03T05:37:30] thinking

**Creating a structured plan**

I'm thinking of a four-step plan for the user's request, but it seems they want a file, so I need to think about how to reflect the tasks properly. The plan inc
ludes:

1. Restating the problem (done)
2. Conceptual solution (still pending)
3. Writing pseudocode (still pending)
4. Implementing the solution in a Python file (still pending)

I’ll complete the restatement and label the conceptual solution as in progress. Since this is a multi-phase task, a structured plan seems fitting. I should clar
ify whether the user wants everything combined or separated in the file.
**Outlining the solution process**

I’m set to create `solution.py`, which will include the actual Python code. To comply with guidelines, I should start with a preamble like, “I’m about to create
 `solution.py` with the Python implementation.” Then, I’ll summarize the steps: first restating the problem, explaining the conceptual solution, and providing t
he pseudocode before creating the file.

The restatement is straightforward: there are N wormholes, and I need to find the count of pairings allowing a cycle. The conceptual solution involves preproces
sing the wormholes, enumerating pairings recursively, and simulating the pairs to count cycles.

Here’s the complete solution:

**Restatement**
- You have N (even) distinct wormhole points. They form N/2 bidirectional pairs. A cow walking in the +x direction may enter a wormhole, pop out its pair, and c
ontinue. Count how many pairings create at least one infinite loop for some start.

**Conceptual Solution**
- For each wormhole, find its immediate neighbor to the right on the same y.
- Recursively generate all perfect pairings.
- For each pairing, simulate up to N steps from each start. If you never exit, there’s a cycle—count it.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N and coords
compute next_on_right[i] = closest j with same y and xj>xi
partner = [0]*(N+1)
count = 0

function cycle_exists():
  for each start in 1..N:
    pos = start
    repeat N times:
      pos = next_on_right[partner[pos]]
      if pos==0: break
    if completed N moves: return True
  return False

function backtrack():
  find first unpaired i
  if none:
    if cycle_exists(): count++
    return
  for j>i unpaired:
    pair i&j
    backtrack()
    unpair i&j

backtrack()
print(count)
```

The implementation is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
