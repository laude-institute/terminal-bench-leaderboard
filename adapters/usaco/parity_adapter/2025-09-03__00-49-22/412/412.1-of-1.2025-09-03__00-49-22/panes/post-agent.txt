[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Reordering the Cows [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100), conveniently numbered 1..N, are
standing in a row.  Their ordering is described by an array A, where A(i)
is the number of the cow in position i.  Farmer John wants to rearrange
them into a different ordering for a group photo, described by an array B,
where B(i) is the number of the cow that should end up in position i.

For example, suppose the cows start out ordered as follows:

A = 5 1 4 2 3

and suppose Farmer John would like them instead to be ordered like this:

B = 2 5 3 1 4

To re-arrange themselves from the "A" ordering to the "B" ordering, the
cows perform a number of "cyclic" shifts.  Each of these cyclic shifts
begins with a cow moving to her proper location in the "B" ordering,
displacing another cow, who then moves to her proper location, displacing
another cow, and so on, until eventually a cow ends up in the position
initially occupied by the first cow on the cycle.  For example, in the
ordering above, if we start a cycle with cow 5, then cow 5 would move to
position 2, displacing cow 1, who moves to position 4, displacing cow 2,
who moves to position 1, ending the cycle.  The cows keep performing cyclic
shifts until every cow eventually ends up in her proper location in the "B"
ordering.  Observe that each cow participates in exactly one cyclic shift,
unless she occupies the same position in the "A" and "B" orderings.

Please compute the number of different cyclic shifts, as well as the length
of the longest cyclic shift, as the cows rearrange themselves.

PROBLEM NAME: reorder

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integer A(i).

* Lines 2+N..1+2N: Line 1+N+i contains the integer B(i).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5
5
1
4
2
3
2
5
3
1
4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, the first giving the number of
        cyclic shifts and the second giving the number cows involved
        in the longest such shift.  If there are no cyclic shifts,
        output -1 for the second number.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2 3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are two cyclic shifts, one involving cows 5, 1, and 2, and the other
involving cows 3 and 4.

**Solving the permutation problem**

I'm looking into how to implement a solution in Python for a USACO problem involving two permutations, A and B, of cows positioned from 1 to N. A[i] indicates t
he cow at position i, while B[i] shows where that cow needs to go. The goal is to map each cow from its initial position to its desired position, following the
cycles they form. Essentially, I want to track the movement of the cows as they transition from A to B through these cycles.
**Tracking cow movement in cycles**

I'm figuring out how to track cow movement through cycles by defining a function f(x) = y, where y is the cow currently in cow x's target position in B. To find
 cycles: if cow 5 starts, I need to find its position j in B where B[j] = 5, and then see which cow occupies that position in A. I’ll then define a mapping, so
for each cow x, I’ll precompute its desired position in B and determine if it's in the correct place or part of a cycle. If all cows are already in place, I’ll
return "0 -1".
**Implementing cycle detection for cow positions**

I’m working on a Python solution for tracking cow positions through cycles. The approach involves checking each cow and counting the length of its cycle if it h
asn’t been visited. I’ll create a mapping for each cow's desired position and then build a permutation based on initial positions. If there are no cycles, I’ll
output "0 -1."

To finalize, I’ll create a script called `solution.py` that executes this algorithm with clear inputs and outputs. Let’s wrap this up with a plain English resta
tement, conceptual solution, pseudocode, and the code itself in the file.
**Preparing final message for solution**

Let's organize my final message! First, I'll restate that we have N cows arranged in a row, described by initial arrangement A and desired arrangement B. Cows m
ove in cyclical displacements until they reach their targets, and I need to count the number of cycles and find the longest cycle.

Next, I'll provide a pseudocode solution to compute the permutation where each cow displaces another. Finally, I'll indicate that I'm applying a patch to create
 the `solution.py` file to implement this solution.

**Restatement**
We have N cows, initially arranged in order A, and we want them in order B. Cows move via displacement cycles: each cycle starts when a cow moves to her B-posit
ion, displacing another, and so on, until the cycle closes.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Build a permutation P over cows where P[x] is the cow initially at x’s target B-position.
- Ignore cows already in place (P[x] == x).
- Find all nontrivial cycles in P: each cycle is one “cyclic shift.”
- Count these cycles and record the maximum cycle length.
- If there are no cycles, output `0 -1`; otherwise output `<count> <max_length>`.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read list A of length N
read list B of length N

for each cow c in 1..N:
    desired_pos[c] = index i where B[i] == c

for each cow x in 1..N:
    P[x] = A[ desired_pos[x] - 1 ]

visited = array of N+1 falses
cycles = 0
maxlen = 0

for x in 1..N:
    if not visited[x] and P[x] != x:
        cycles += 1
        length = 0
        y = x
        while not visited[y]:
            visited[y] = true
            y = P[y]
            length += 1
        maxlen = max(maxlen, length)

if cycles == 0:
    print "0 -1"
else:
    print cycles, maxlen
```
