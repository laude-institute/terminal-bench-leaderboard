Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.
Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Save your solution as solution.py
No outside libraries are allowed.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's 3 prize cows, Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, are always wandering off
to  the far reaches of the farm!  He needs your help herding them back together.

The main field in the farm is long and skinny -- we can think of it as a number
line, on which a cow can occupy any integer location.  The 3 cows are currently
situated at different integer locations, and Farmer John wants to move
them so they occupy three consecutive locations (e.g., positions 6, 7, and 8).

Unfortunately, the cows are rather sleepy, and Farmer John has trouble getting
their attention to make them move.  At any point in time, he can only make a cow
move if she is an "endpoint" (either the minimum or maximum position among all
the cows).  When he moves a cow, he can instruct her to move to any unoccupied
integer location as long as in this new location she is no longer an endpoint.
Observe that over time, these types of moves tend to push the cows closer and
closer together.

Please determine the minimum and maximum number of moves possible before the
cows become grouped in three consecutive locations.

INPUT FORMAT:
The input file contains one line with three space-separated integers, giving the
locations of Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred.  Each location is an integer in the
range $1 \ldots 10^9$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line of output should contain the minimum number of moves Farmer John
needs to make to group the cows together.  The second line of output should
contain the maximum number of such moves he could conceivably make before the
cows become grouped together.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 7 9
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
2

The minimum number of moves is 1 --- if Farmer John moves the cow in position 4
to position 8, then the cows are at consecutive locations 7, 8, 9.  The maximum
number of  moves is 2.  For example, the cow at position 9 could be moved to
position 6, then the cow at position 7 could be moved to position 5.

**Clarifying herding problem**

The user wants me to break down the problem step-by-step. First, I should restate it in simple terms. Next, conceptualize the solution clearly. Then, draft pseu
docode and finally save the solution as a Python file, keeping to standard libraries only.

The task comes from USACO's "herding" problem, where the goal is to find the minimum and maximum moves needed. Special cases arise if there's a gap of 2 between
 numbers. If they're already consecutive, the minimum moves would be 0, or 1 if they have a gap of 2.
**Framing the herding solution**

I need to summarize the steps for the herding problem. First, if the cows are already consecutive, the minimum moves required is 0. If there’s a gap of 2 in any
 position, the minimum is 1; otherwise, it’s 2.

For maximum moves, I can calculate it as the largest gap minus one. My implementation plan includes reading positions, sorting them, calculating gaps, and deter
mining min and max moves before saving everything in a Python file named solution.py. It's important to handle edge cases as well.
**Planning the herding solution**

I need to outline the steps for solving the herding problem. First, I will parse input data and convert it into integers before sorting the list. After that, I'
ll calculate the values for x, y, and z, then determine the minimum and maximum moves needed. It’s clear I should present the problem in plain English along wit
h pseudocode, and finally save everything in a file named solution.py. Clarity is key, so I’ll organize sections like **Restatement**, **Approach**, and **Pseud
ocode** for better readability.

**Restatement**
We have three cows standing at distinct integer positions on a number line. In each move, you can pick one of the two endpoint cows (the leftmost or rightmost)
and move it anywhere to an unoccupied integer spot that is strictly between the other two cows’ positions. We need to find:
- the minimum number of moves to make their positions three consecutive integers,
- the maximum number of moves possible before they become consecutive.

**Approach**
- Sort the three positions as x < y < z.
- **Maximum moves**: each move shrinks the larger gap by moving an endpoint one spot inward; the worst-case count is `max(z−y, y−x) − 1`.
- **Minimum moves**:
  - If already consecutive (x+1==y and y+1==z), it’s 0.
  - Else if there’s exactly one empty space between any adjacent pair (gap of 2), you can fill it in one move (1).
  - Otherwise you need two moves (2).

**Pseudocode**
```
read three integers into list positions
sort positions into x, y, z
max_moves = max(y-x, z-y) - 1
if x+1==y and y+1==z:
    min_moves = 0
elif y-x==2 or z-y==2:
    min_moves = 1
else:
    min_moves = 2
print(min_moves)
print(max_moves)
```
