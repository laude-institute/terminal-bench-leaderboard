[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Nearby Cows [Neal Wu and Eric Price, 2011]

Farmer John has noticed that his cows often move between nearby fields.
Taking this into account, he wants to plant enough grass in each of his
fields not only for the cows situated initially in that field, but also for
cows visiting from nearby fields.

Specifically, FJ's farm consists of N fields (1 <= N <= 100,000), where
some pairs of fields are connected with bi-directional trails (N-1 of them
in total).  FJ has designed the farm so that between any two fields i and
j, there is a unique path made up of trails connecting between i and j.
Field i is home to C(i) cows, although cows sometimes move to a different
field by crossing up to K trails (1 <= K <= 20).

FJ wants to plant enough grass in each field i to feed the maximum number
of cows, M(i), that could possibly end up in that field -- that is, the
number of cows that can potentially reach field i by following at most K
trails.  Given the structure of FJ's farm and the value of C(i) for each
field i, please help FJ compute M(i) for every field i.

PROBLEM NAME: nearcows

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..N: Each line contains two space-separated integers, i and j
        (1 <= i,j <= N) indicating that fields i and j are directly
        connected by a trail.

* Lines N+1..2N: Line N+i contains the integer C(i). (0 <= C(i) <=
        1000)

SAMPLE INPUT:

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 fields, with trails connecting (5,1), (3,6), (2,4), (2,1), and
(3,2).  Field i has C(i) = i cows.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..N: Line i should contain the value of M(i).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Field 1 has M(1) = 15 cows within a distance of 2 trails, etc.

[2025-09-03T05:59:20] thinking

**Considering recursion and BFS**

I’m pondering whether depth-first search (DFS) recursion will struggle with a deep tree, especially one that could reach a height of 100k. I think the default r
ecursion limit in Python should handle 300k, but the overhead of 100k frames might risk stack overflow. Maybe an iterative approach would be better, yet it comp
licates dynamic programming.

Alternatively, I could use breadth-first search (BFS) to establish parent-child relationships, recognizing that a bottom-up approach requires processing leaves
first. However, I’ve got to ensure that I handle dependencies correctly with the right orders.
**Outlining the BFS Approach**

I'm considering using reversed BFS, where children are processed before their parent nodes. This should work well as I compute the order, parent, and depth of e
ach node. For `dp1`, I can process nodes in reverse order, updating values for each neighbor unless it's the parent.

Then for `dp2`, I’ll start from the root, ensuring each parent is processed before their children, allowing for a smooth calculation without recursion. I'll out
line the implementation steps in `solution.py` to ensure clarity and efficiency.
**Preparing to apply the patch**

I need to include the patch instruction clearly, starting with structured reasoning. First, I’ll restate the problem, then provide a solution in plain English,
and lastly show the pseudocode. Following that, I’ll mention applying the patch after outlining all those points.

Then, I recognize the need to manage tool calls properly; the reasoning and explanations belong in the final reply, and I’ll handle the patch application in the
 commentary channel. So, I’ll format the final output accordingly, ensuring clarity in my explanation before proceeding with the patch.

1. Problem Restatement
- We have a tree of N fields, each with C(i) cows. For each field i, compute M(i): the total cows in any field reachable from i in at most K edges.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Use tree dynamic programming with two passes:
  • Bottom-up (post-order) to compute dp1[u][d]: sum of cows in u’s subtree at distance d from u.
  • Top-down (pre-order) to compute dp2[u][d]: sum of cows outside u’s subtree at distance d from u.
- Then M(u) = Σ_{d=0..K} (dp1[u][d] + dp2[u][d]).

3. Pseudocode
```
Read N, K
Build adjacency list adj
Read cows[1..N]
Do BFS from 1 to get parent[] and order[]
Initialize dp1 and dp2 arrays size (N+1)×(K+1)
For u in reversed(order):                     # bottom-up
    dp1[u][0] = cows[u]
    For each child v of u:
        For d in 1..K:
            dp1[u][d] += dp1[v][d-1]
For u in order:                              # top-down
    If u != root:
        p = parent[u]
        For d in 1..K:
            dp2[u][d] = dp2[p][d-1] + dp1[p][d-1]
            If d>=2: subtract dp1[u][d-2]
For u = 1..N:
    M[u] = sum(dp1[u][d] + dp2[u][d] for d=0..K)
Print M[1..N]
```

I’ve saved the full implementation in `solution.py`.
