FJ has designed the farm so that between any two fields i and\nj, there is a unique path made up of trails connecting between i and j. \nField i is home to C(i) cows, although cows sometimes move to a different\nfield by crossing up to K trails (1 <= K <= 20).  \n\nFJ wants to plant enough grass in each field i to feed the maximum number\nof cows, M(i), that could possibly end up in that field -- that is, the\nnumber of cows that can potentially reach field i by following at most K\ntrails.  Given the structure of FJ's farm and the value of C(i) for each\nfield i, please help FJ compute M(i) for every field i.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: nearcows\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.\n\n* Lines 2..N: Each line contains two space-separated integers, i and j\n        (1 <= i,j <= N) indicating that fields i and j are directly\n        connected by a trail.\n\n* Lines N+1..2N: Line N+i contains the integer C(i). (0 <= C(i) <=\n        1000)\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n6 2\n5 1\n3 6\n2 4\n2 1\n3 2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 6 fields, with trails connecting (5,1), (3,6), (2,4), (2,1), and\n(3,2).  Field i has C(i) = i cows.  \n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Lines 1..N: Line i should contain the value of M(i).\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n15\n21\n16\n10\n8\n11\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nField 1 has M(1) = 15 cows within a distance of 2 trails, etc.\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
