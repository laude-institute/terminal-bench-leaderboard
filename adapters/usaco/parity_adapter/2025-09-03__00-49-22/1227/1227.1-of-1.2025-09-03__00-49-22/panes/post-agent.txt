[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John, desperate to win the award for best cow photographer at the county
fair, is trying to take the perfect photograph of his $N$ cows
($2 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$, $N$ even).

Farmer John owns cows of two potential breeds: Guernseys and Holsteins.
To make his photo as aesthetic as possible, he wants to line up his
cows so that as many Guernseys are in even-numbered positions in the line
as possible (the first position in the line is an odd position, the next is
an even position, and so on). Due to his lack of strong
communication with his cows, the only way he can achieve his goal is by asking
even length "prefixes" of his cows to reverse themselves (a prefix
consists of the range of cows from the first cow up to the $j$th cow
for some position $j$).

Please count the minimum number of reversals required for Farmer John to achieve
his goal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $N$.

The second line contains a string of length $N,$ specifying the initial ordering
of the cows from left to right. Each 'H' represents a Holstein, while each 'G'
represents a Guernsey.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the minimum number of reversals needed on a single line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
14
GGGHGHHGHHHGHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, it suffices to reverse the prefix consisting of the first six
cows.


   GGGHGHHGHHHGHG (Before)
-> HGHGGGHGHHHGHG (After)

Before the reversal, four Guernseys were at even positions. After the reversal,
six Guernseys are at even positions. It is impossible for there to be more than
six Guernseys at even positions.

SCORING:
Test cases 2-6 satisfy $N\le 1000$.Test cases 7-11 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Finding minimum reversals for G's**

I'm thinking about how to maximize the number of G's at even positions by reversing even-length prefixes. Each operation reverses a substring from the start up
to an even index, and my aim is to compute the minimum number of reversals needed to achieve the best arrangement. It’s important to count the maximum possible
G's at even positions in a string of length N, which can be up to 200,000. I'm focusing on finding that optimal arrangement and determining the minimal operatio
ns to get there.
**Analyzing prefix reversals**

I'm thinking about how to permute a string using only prefix reversals of even lengths. It’s interesting because these reversals can sort any string, but they a
lso lead me to consider how many G's I can place at even positions. The maximum G's I could potentially have at even positions is limited by the smaller of the
total G's or half of N.

From my sample counting of G's in a string, I found 7 G's, but it seemed impossible to exceed 6 at even positions. This might be due to parity changes: reversin
g affects the position parities and influences how characters get shifted. I should analyze how these flips impact G’s distribution between even and odd positio
ns to determine the maximum possible G's at even positions more accurately.
**Maximizing G's through flips**

I'm analyzing how flipping prefixes of even lengths affects the positions of G's, swapping their parity within the flipped segment. This means that G’s from odd
 positions can move to even ones and vice versa. The maximum number of G's at even positions can be recalculated based on these movements.

I realize I need to find the best configuration to maximize G's at even positions after one or two flips. It seems plausible that multiple flips could help shif
t more characters forward, but at most, I think we might need two flips to optimize the arrangement effectively. Precomputing prefix counts for G's at odd and e
ven positions could help streamline the process.

**Restatement**
- We have an even-length lineup of ‘G’ and ‘H’. We can reverse any even-length prefix to move cows.
- Our goal is to maximize the count of ‘G’ at even positions, and compute the minimum reversals needed to reach that best count.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Compute how many ‘G’ already occupy even positions.
- For each possible even-length prefix, calculate the effect of reversing that prefix: all ‘G’ in odd positions of the prefix move to even positions, while the
prefix’s even-position ‘G’ leave even spots.
- Track the highest possible even-position ‘G’ count over all prefix reversals.
- If the initial count is already optimal, answer is 0; otherwise one reversal (the best prefix) suffices, so answer is 1.

**Pseudocode**
```
read n, s
build prefix_odd[i], prefix_even[i] for G counts up to i
total_even = prefix_even[n]
best = total_even
for k in 2..n step 2:
    gain = prefix_odd[k] + (total_even - prefix_even[k])
    best = max(best, gain)
if best == total_even:
    print 0
else:
    print 1
```
