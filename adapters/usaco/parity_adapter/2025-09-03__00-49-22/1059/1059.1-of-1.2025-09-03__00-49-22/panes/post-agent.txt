[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's cows have been holding a daily online gathering on the "mooZ"  video
meeting platform.  For fun, they have invented a simple number game to play
during the meeting to keep themselves entertained.

Elsie has three positive integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ ($A\le B\le C$). These
integers are supposed to be secret, so she will not directly reveal them to her
sister Bessie. Instead, she gives Bessie seven (not necessarily distinct)
integers in the range $1 \ldots 10^9$, claiming that they are $A$, $B$, $C$,
$A+B$, $B+C$, $C+A$, and $A+B+C$ in some order.

Given a list of these seven numbers, please help Bessie determine  $A$, $B$, and
$C$. It can be shown that the answer is unique.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The only line of input consists of seven space-separated integers.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Print $A$, $B$, and $C$ separated by spaces.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 2 11 4 9 7 9
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2 2 7

SCORING:
Test cases 2-3 satisfy $C\le 50$.Test cases 4-10 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Solving for A, B, C**

I have seven numbers: A, B, C, and their sums in a random order. To find A, B, and C, I can sort the list. The largest number will be A+B+C, so let's call that
S. Among the first six numbers, the three smallest should ideally be A, B, and C, but it gets tricky sometimes. For instance, if A is very small compared to B a
nd C, it might complicate the ordering. I’ll double-check this with an example to clarify!
**Formulating the algorithm**

I’ve figured out that to identify A, B, and C, I should sort the list of numbers. The largest number will be A+B+C. Simplistically, if I take the two smallest n
umbers, those should be A and B. I can then compute C as A+B+C minus the values of A and B. This algorithm seems solid. Testing with various numbers indicates i
t works, even when values are repeated or extreme. Now I just need to restate it in plain English and write the Python code without requiring any libraries.
**Creating solution.py**

I’m getting ready to create a Python script called solution.py. This script will read a single line of input, sort the numbers, and then compute A, B, and C bas
ed on the smallest and largest values. It looks like sys.stdin.read() works well for this, so I’ll use that.

Next, I’ll outline three steps in plain text: restating the task, describing the concept, and providing pseudocode. Afterward, I’ll add the script content and c
onfirm that solution.py has been saved. Then, I'll apply the patch.

1. Problem Restatement
Given seven integers that are the values A, B, C, A+B, A+C, B+C, and A+B+C in arbitrary order, recover the original positive integers A, B, and C (with A ≤ B ≤
C).

2. Conceptual Solution
- Sort the seven numbers.
- The smallest two values are A and B (since A≤B≤C and all pair sums are larger).
- The largest value is A+B+C.
- Compute C as (A+B+C) – A – B.

3. Pseudocode
```
read list nums of 7 integers
sort nums
A = nums[0]
B = nums[1]
total = nums[6]       # this is A+B+C
C = total - A - B
print A, B, C
```

4. Implementation saved to `solution.py`.
