[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has received a shipment of $N$ large hay bales ($1 \le N \le 4000$)
and placed them at various locations along the road leading to his barn.
Unfortunately, he completely forgets that Bessie the cow is out grazing along
the road, and she may now be trapped within the bales!
Each bale $j$ has a size $S_j$ and a distinct position $P_j$ giving its location
along the one-dimensional road.  Bessie the cow starts at some location where
there is no hay bale, and can move around freely along the road, even up to the
position at which a bale is located, but she cannot cross through this position.
As an exception, if she runs in the same direction for $D$ units of distance,
she builds up enough speed to break through and permanently eliminate any hay
bale of size strictly less than $D$.  Of course, after doing this, she
might open up more space to allow her to make a run at other hay bales,
eliminating them as well.  
Bessie can escape to freedom if she can eventually break through either the 
leftmost or rightmost hay bale.  Please compute the total area of the road
consisting of real-valued starting positions from which Bessie cannot escape.
For example, if Bessie cannot escape if she starts between hay bales at 
positions 1 and 5, then these encompass an area of size 4 from which she  cannot
escape.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines describes a
bale, and contains two integers giving its size and position, each in the range
$1\ldots 10^9$.

**Analyzing Bessie's trapping problem**

Bessie gets trapped between two bales if she can't break either one or any interior bales to reach the edges. This is akin to the "Trapped in the Haybales" problem from USACO. Specifically, I'm dealing with a Gold version that focuses on computing the length of intervals where Bessie is trapped. The key is to identify pairs of bales and their distances. If the run-up distance between two bales meets certain size conditions, it informs whether she can escape.
**Clarifying Bessie's escape from bales**

If both bales have sizes larger than the gap, Bessie will be trapped between them. When I look at adjacent bales (i and i+1), if there's no bale in between, she can run to one and attempt to break it by covering the gap distance. If the gap is greater than the size of either bale, she can break it. If the gap is less than or equal to both sizes, she remains trapped. However, if the gap allows her to break one, she might escape through a series of breaks leading to an open edge.
**Exploring Bessie's potential traps**

So, I’ve noticed Bessie is trapped in segments based on the gaps and sizes of adjacent bales. For example, between the bales of sizes 8 and 7, the gap size of 7 means she can't break either, thus creating a trapped segment. However, I suspect there might be non-adjacent bales that can also trap her. A two-pointer method might help – I can look at pairs of bales to see if the conditions for trapping are met. If they are, I’ll record the trapped intervals and sum them as my result.
**Creating the solution approach**

I’m designing a solution to find lengths of trapped intervals between bales based on their sizes and positions. If the gap between two bales is less than or equal to both their sizes, Bessie is trapped. I’ll use a stack to track potential bales, examining each newly added bale against the ones in the stack. This way, I can capture and sum the lengths of trapped intervals while managing overlapping intervals. Finally, I’m preparing to create a solution file with the implementation and explanations.

**1. Problem Restatement**  
We have N hay bales on a 1D road, each at a distinct position with a given size. Bessie can move freely between bales but cannot cross one unless she builds up a running distance D strictly greater than its size to break it. Once broken, the bale is removed. We want the total length of starting positions (real values) from which Bessie cannot eventually break through to either end of the road.

**2. Conceptual Solution**  
- Sort bales by position.  
- Sweep left to right, maintaining a stack of “potential left barriers.”  
- For each new bale as a right barrier, compare distance D to the top-of-stack bale:  
  - If D > right‐barrier’s size, the right one is breakable (no trap), stop checking.  
  - Else if D > left‐barrier’s size, pop the left barrier and retry (it’s breakable).  
  - Otherwise, neither can break the other, so they form a trapped interval [left, right].  
- Record all such intervals, then merge any overlaps and sum their lengths.

**3. Pseudocode**  
```
read N
read list of (position, size)
sort bales by position
stack = empty
intervals = []

for each bale i in order:
    while stack not empty:
        j = stack.top
        d = pos[i] - pos[j]
        if d > size[i]:
            break            # right bale breakable
        if d > size[j]:
            stack.pop()      # left bale breakable
            continue
        intervals.append((pos[j], pos[i]))
        break
    stack.push(i)

merge sorted intervals:
    total = 0
    track current_start, current_end
    for each (s,e):
        if s > current_end:
            total += current_end - current_start
            reset to s,e
        else:
            current_end = max(current_end, e)
    add last segment length
print total
```

**4. Implementation**  
The full Python solution has been saved to `solution.py`. It reads from standard input, applies the stack‐based detection of trapped intervals, merges them, and prints the total trapped length.
