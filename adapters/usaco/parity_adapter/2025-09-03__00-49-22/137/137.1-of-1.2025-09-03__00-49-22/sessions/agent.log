[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Tied Down [Brian Dean, 2012]

As we all know, Bessie the cow likes nothing more than causing mischief on
the farm.  To keep her from causing too much trouble, Farmer John decides
to tie Bessie down to a fence with a long rope.  When viewed from above,
the fence consists of N posts (1 <= N <= 10) that are arranged along
vertical line, with Bessie's position (bx, by) located to the right of this
vertical line.  The rope FJ uses to tie down Bessie is described by a
sequence of M line segments (3 <= M <= 10,000), where the first segment
starts at Bessie's position and the last ends at Bessie's position. No
fence post lies on any of these line segments.  However, line segments may
cross, and multiple line segments may overlap at their endpoints.

Here is an example of the scene, viewed from above:



To help Bessie escape, the rest of the cows have stolen a saw from the
barn.  Please determine the minimum number of fence posts they must cut
through and remove in order for Bessie to be able to pull free (meaning she
can run away to the right without the rope catching on any of the fence posts).

All (x,y) coordinates in the input (fence posts, Bessie, and line segment
endpoints) lie in the range 0..10,000.  All fence posts have the same x
coordinate, and bx is larger than this value.

PROBLEM NAME: tied

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: N, M, bx, by.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated x and y
        coordinates of fence post i.

* Lines 2+N..2+N+M: Each of these M+1 lines contains, in sequence, the
        space-separated x and y coordinates of a point along the rope.
        The first and last points are always the same as Bessie's
        location (bx, by).

INPUT DETAILS:

There are two posts at (2,3) and (2,1).  Bessie is at (6,1).  The rope goes
from (6,1) to (2,4) to (1,1), and so on, ending finally at (6,1). The shape
of the rope is the same as in the figure above.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of posts that need to be removed in order
        for Bessie to escape by running to the right.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Removing either post 1 or post 2 will allow Bessie to escape.

**Analyzing rope crossings**

I’m looking at how segments of a rope cross a fence line. Each time it crosses to the other side, I wonder about the rope's position. The posts are on a vertical fence line, and I realize the rope can cross back and forth. Bessie's starting point is to the right, and since the polygon closes up, the number of crossings should be even. I’m figuring out where the rope is relative to the fence and which posts are trapped between crossings.
**Determining post removals**

I'm outlining an algorithm to analyze the rope's interactions with vertical lines where the posts are located. First, I’ll project the rope onto the x-axis to find intersections with these lines. By computing the y-coordinates of these intersections and sorting them, I can then determine where the rope crosses. 

The rope alternates side positions, and I realize that segments between certain crossings will trap posts. For the rope to be removed without snagging, I need to cut down all posts within these left intervals. Essentially, the minimum number of posts I need to remove is the count of those that lie in any left interval.
**Implementing intersection counting**

I'm working on counting posts within a certain y-range, looking for low and high bounds. If there are no intersections, then the answer is zero. When checking for crossings, I need to avoid dividing by zero, so if the x-coordinates are equal, I can skip that case. I’ll use floating-point precision since the intersections yield float values, while post y-values are integers.

Now, as I implement this, I have a clear structure outlined for the code in a file called solution.py. I’ll read the inputs, find intersections, count the posts in the specified ranges, and determine the minimum effectively.

**Preparing the final solution**

I think my solution works well for the sample input. I need to consider edge cases like when all rope is outside or if intersections are empty, which prints 0 correctly. It's also essential to think about situations with more loops, especially even loops. The input reading seems solid, and the return types are correct. The time complexity is manageable. 

Now, I need to ensure I've explicitly addressed each part the user requested: restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, and providing pseudocode in the output.
**Composing the final answer**

I realize I wrote the code directly but didn’t include the reasoning text, which the user requested. Since they wanted a comprehensive write-up rather than just starting with the code, I need to include the following sections: 

**Restatement**: A concise overview of the problem. 

**Approach**: Explaining how to compute intersections and count posts per loop.

**Pseudocode**: Presenting the structure of the solution without repeating the full code.

**File**: Mention that solution.py is created and saved. 

This should fully address the user’s request!

**Problem Restatement**  
We have a closed rope (polyline) tied at Bessie’s position to the right of a straight fence (vertical line) with N posts on it. The rope may cross back and forth across the fence, creating “loops” on the left side. Any fence post lying inside one of those loops will snag the rope when Bessie pulls it to the right. We need to find the minimum number of posts to cut so that there is at least one left‐side loop containing as few posts as possible—cutting those frees Bessie through that gap.

**Solution Approach**  
- All fence posts share the same x‐coordinate, call it `fence_x`.  
- Walk each rope segment: whenever it strictly crosses the line `x = fence_x`, compute the y‐coordinate of that crossing by linear interpolation.  
- Sort these intersection y’s. Consecutive pairs (1st–2nd, 3rd–4th, …) define the vertical spans of left‐side loops.  
- For each such span, count how many posts’ y‐coordinates lie strictly between the two crossing y’s.  
- The answer is the minimum count over all loops (or 0 if the rope never crosses left).

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N, M, bx, by
read N posts; record their y’s and the common fence_x
read the M+1 rope points in order

inters = []
for each consecutive point pair (x1,y1)->(x2,y2):
    if (x1 - fence_x)*(x2 - fence_x) < 0:
        t = (fence_x - x1)/(x2 - x1)
        y_cross = y1 + t*(y2 - y1)
        inters.append(y_cross)

sort inters
if inters empty:
    print 0
    exit

ans = ∞
for i in 0..len(inters)-1 step 2:
    low = inters[i]
    high = inters[i+1]
    cnt = number of post_y with low < post_y < high
    ans = min(ans, cnt)

print ans
```

**Implementation**  
The above solution is saved in `solution.py` in the working directory. You can run it with:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
