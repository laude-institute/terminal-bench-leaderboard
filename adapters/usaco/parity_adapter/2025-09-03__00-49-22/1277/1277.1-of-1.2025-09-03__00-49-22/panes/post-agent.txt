[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Because Bessie is bored of playing with her usual text string where the only
characters are 'C,' 'O,' and 'W,' Farmer John gave her $Q$ new strings
($1 \leq Q \leq 100$), where the only characters are 'M' and 'O.' Bessie's
favorite word out of the characters 'M' and 'O' is obviously "MOO," so she wants
to turn each of the $Q$ strings into "MOO" using the following operations:

Replace either the first or last character with its opposite (so that 'M'
becomes 'O' and 'O' becomes 'M'). Delete either the first or last character.
Unfortunately, Bessie is lazy and does not want to perform more operations than
absolutely necessary. For each string, please help her determine the minimum
number of operations necessary to form "MOO" or output $-1$ if this is
impossible.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $Q$.

The next $Q$ lines of input each consist of a string, each of its characters
either 'M' or 'O'. Each string has at least 1 and at most 100 characters.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the answer for each input string on a separate line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
MOMMOM
MMO
MOO
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
-1
0

A sequence of $4$ operations transforming the first string into "MOO" is as
follows:


Replace the last character with O (operation 1)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)

The second string cannot be transformed into "MOO." The third string is already
"MOO," so no operations need to be performed.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: Every string has length at most $3$.Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

**Understanding substring reductions**

I'm looking at the task of reducing a string to exactly three characters, specifically aiming for the sequence "MOO." The core idea is to select a substring of
length 3 from the initial string, and figure out how many deletions are needed to isolate that substring. The deletions will equal the total length of the strin
g minus three. However, I need to remember that I can only delete characters from the ends, so my chosen substring must be contiguous.
**Analyzing deletion and flipping strategy**

I see we need to delete characters before index l and after index r in the string. The sequence of deletions matters, but overall, the cost is the same. However
, since we can flip characters at either end, it seems simpler.

For our targeted length-3 substring, s[0], s[1], and s[2] must equal "MOO." The middle character's final position needs to be 'O', but flipping it gets tricky s
ince it can't be at the middle when I want to make changes. If it's wrong, I need to flip it earlier while it’s at an end during the deletion process.
**Crafting the substring solution**

I need to find candidate substrings for transformation that have 'O' in the middle, meaning s[l+1] must be 'O'. For any possible substring, flips will be needed
 if s[l] isn’t 'M' or if s[l+2] isn’t 'O'. I can only flip characters at the ends, which allows for only limited adjustments when reducing the string.

First, if the string has fewer than three characters, it's impossible. For strings already three characters long, I'll check if it matches the target. Then, I n
eed to calculate the minimum number of operations (deletions and flips) across valid substrings to achieve "MOO." I'll summarize everything clearly and prepare
the implementation.
**Implementing the solution in Python**

I've composed my Python script for the task, starting with standard input and parsing. This script reads the number of queries and each string, then checks for
possible transformations into "MOO." It efficiently calculates the minimum operations needed for flips and deletions.

If the string length is at least three, it evaluates possible substrings where the middle character is 'O' and tracks the lowest cost for reaching the goal. If
no valid transformation exists, it prints -1. Now, I’m ready to proceed with adding this implementation as a patch.

**Conceptualizing solution strategy**

The user is asking for a solution to transform strings into "MOO" using specific operations. First, I need to restate the problem clearly and conceptualize the
solution in pseudocode. The solution needs to be implemented in Python 3 without any external libraries. We can approach the problem using a breadth-first searc
h (BFS) method, considering the constraints of character replacements and deletions. Even though this could lead to a large state space, it seems feasible given
 the maximum length of the strings and the number of test cases.
**Analyzing BFS vs. DP approach**

I'm considering the breadth-first search (BFS) method for this problem, which might involve dealing with around 10,000 states due to string lengths of up to 100
, which seems manageable.

Alternatively, I could use dynamic programming (DP): focusing on substrings that would end as "MOO". I would look to delete prefixes and suffixes and count the
necessary flips to match "MOO". For any substring of at least length 3, I'd calculate how many deletions are needed. The total number of deletions appears to be
 constant, and I'm assessing how to handle the flipping of characters within these substrings.
**Finalizing algorithm and pseudocode**

I need to clarify the sequence of operations when transforming the strings. I can flip characters only at the ends after removing certain parts to get to "MOO".
 Flipping earlier seems less optimal because total deletion costs remain constant. For strings shorter than three characters, it’s impossible.

I’ll outline the pseudocode for my solution: read the number of test cases, and for each string, check its length. If it's less than three, print -1. Otherwise,
 compute flips and operations based on specific conditions. I'll implement this in the solution.py file on completion.
**Implementing solution in Python**

There's no need for BFS in this case. I'm getting ready to write the code for the solution in Python 3, which will be saved as solution.py. The main function wi
ll read input data, loop through each string, and compute the necessary operations to transform it into "MOO".

I’ll define the function, calculate flips, and gather results in a list for output. The logic looks good, and I can skip making a separate plan since the steps
are straightforward. Now, I'll create the solution.py file with the complete code!

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing the described strategy: for each string, it selects the optimal length-3 substring whose middle is ‘O’, computes necessary
 flips on the ends, adds the fixed deletion count, and outputs the minimum operations or –1. Let me know if you’d like test runs or further adjustments!
