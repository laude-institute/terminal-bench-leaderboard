[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to take a photograph of his herd of cows.  From past
experience, he knows this particular endeavor never usually ends well.

This time, Farmer John has purchased an expensive drone in order to take an
aerial photo. To make the photo look as good as possible, he wants his cows all
to be facing the same direction when the photo is taken.  The cows are currently arranged
in an  $N \times N$ grid ($2 \leq N \leq 1000$) inside a fenced-in square
pasture,  for example:


RLR
RRL
LLR

Here, an 'R' means a cow facing right, and an 'L' means a cow facing left. Since
the cows are packed together, Farmer John cannot walk up to an individual cow to
make it turn around.  All he can do is shout at any row or column of cows to
turn around, causing L's to change to R's and R's to L's within the row or
column in question.  Farmer John can yell at as many rows or columns as he
wants, even at the same row or column more than once.

As expected, Farmer John observes that he is unable to make his cows all face
one common direction.  The best he can do is get all but one of the cows to face
the same direction.  Please determine the identity of such a cow.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines describe rows $1 \ldots N$ in
the grid of cows, each containing a string of length $N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the row and column index of a cow such that if that cow were flipped,
Farmer John could make all his cows face the same direction.  If no such cow
exists, print -1.  If multiple such cows exist, print the one with the  smallest
row index, or if multiple such cows have the same smallest row index, print the
one with the smallest column index.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
RLR
RRL
LLR
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 1

In the example above, the cow in row 1, column 1 (the upper-left corner) is the
offending cow, since Farmer John can shout at row 2 and column 3 to make all
other cows face left, with just this cow facing right.

**Evaluating a solution approach**

I'm trying to simplify the approach for identifying the "bad" cow. The idea is to check potential removal cells and see if the rest can be separated, but with N
 up to 1000, that's way too many operations. I need to aim for O(N^2) or O(N^2 log N). A better way is to look at row and column differences directly. When chec
king separability, if there’s no removal, the row XOR should be consistent across columns. So I’ll refine this further.
**Refining the error-checking method**

I’m focusing on how to ensure each row is consistent across columns by checking if the vector B[i] XOR B[1] remains constant. For each row i, I need to find a v
alue d_i that holds through all columns. The first step is to set t = 0 and compute B = A. I’ll identify “good” rows where this condition holds and count errors
 in columns where it doesn't. Since we’ll allow only one bad cell, it’s crucial to find the best candidate. For t = 1, I'll simply invert A and follow the same
logic to check for consistency.
**Re-evaluating the error-checking strategy**

I'm examining if inverting the whole grid maintains the same relationships. For t = 0, by setting r[1] to 0, I compute columns based on that. I count errors and
 find inconsistencies in cells. However, it fails because the method relies on row 1, which might have errors itself. If the bad cell is in row 1, my calculatio
ns for c and r are flawed. I need a more robust strategy that doesn’t depend on a potentially faulty reference row. I should use majority patterns to determine
r and c, focusing on minimizing inconsistencies across the grid.
**Refining error-checking with references**

I’m looking at how to find optimal values for r and c by selecting references wisely, considering we only have one error to account for in the grid. A simpler a
pproach could involve testing different reference columns, specifically the first two, because at least one should be correct. If I pick r[1] as 0 and derive c
from A, I'll compute based on the references and check for errors. Overall, I need a robust method that ensures we can reliably determine inconsistencies withou
t depending too heavily on potentially faulty reference cells.
**Drafting solution implementation**

I’m outlining my approach to generate the solution in Python. I’ll read the input and construct the grid, converting characters to integers for processing. The
plan includes iterating over combinations of reference rows and columns to derive r and c lists. I’ll optimize the loops to break early if I detect more than on
e error. If no valid candidates are found, I’ll return -1. The time complexity looks doable, so it’s time to implement the code without any external libraries.
Once completed, I’ll validate it with provided samples.

**Problem Restatement**

We have an N×N grid of cows, each facing left (`L`) or right (`R`).  We may “flip” any entire row or column (turning every `L↔R` in that line) as many times as
we like.  It is known that you cannot make all cows face the same way, but by *removing* (i.e. ignoring) exactly one cow, it becomes possible.  Identify the pos
ition (row, column) of such a cow whose removal makes the rest flippable to a single common direction.  If multiple answers exist, choose the smallest row index
, then smallest column index; if none exist, output `-1`.

---

**Solution Outline**

1.  Encode `L=0`, `R=1`.
2.  We seek binary vectors `r[1..N]` (row flips) and `c[1..N]` (column flips) and a target bit `t∈{0,1}` so that
       A[i][j] ⊕ r[i] ⊕ c[j] = t
    for *all but one* cell.
3.  Directly solving all flips for every possible removed cell is too big.  Instead, note that if we anchor one “reference” row and one “reference” column that
are *not* the removed cow’s row/col, we can compute all `r[]` and `c[]` in O(N) and then scan the grid in O(N²), aborting if we see more than one mismatch.
4.  Since the single bad cell can only lie in one row and one column, at least one of the first two rows and one of the first two columns must be *good*.  We th
erefore try all 8 combinations:
    - target `t=0` or `t=1`
    - choose reference row ∈ {1,2}
    - choose reference column ∈ {1,2}
   For each, we set:
     - r[ref_row]=0
     - c[j] = A[ref_row][j] ⊕ t
     - r[i] = A[i][ref_col] ⊕ t ⊕ c[ref_col]
   Then we scan; if exactly one cell mismatches, record it.
5.  After trying all 8, pick the lexicographically smallest (row,col) among found candidates, or `-1` if none.

This runs in O(8·N²), which is fine for N≤1000.

---

**Pseudocode**

```
read N
read grid of chars into A[N][N], mapping 'L'→0, 'R'→1

candidates = empty list

for t in {0,1}:
  for ref_row in {0,1}:          # 0-based
    for ref_col in {0,1}:
      # build flips
      r = array[N]
      c = array[N]
      r[ref_row] = 0
      for j in 0..N-1:
        c[j] = A[ref_row][j] xor t
      for i in 0..N-1:
        r[i] = A[i][ref_col] xor t xor c[ref_col]

      # scan for mismatches
      errors = 0
      for i in 0..N-1:
        for j in 0..N-1:
          if (A[i][j] xor r[i] xor c[j]) != t:
            errors += 1
            bad = (i+1, j+1)
            if errors > 1: break both loops

      if errors == 1:
        candidates.append(bad)

if candidates is empty:
  print(-1)
else:
  answer = min(candidates)   # lexicographically
  print(answer.row, answer.col)
```
