Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nProblem 3: Moo Sick [Rob Seay]\n\nEveryone knows that cows love to listen to all forms of music.  Almost all\nforms, that is -- the great cow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Moozart\nonce discovered that a specific chord tends to make cows rather ill.  This\nchord, known as the ruminant seventh chord, is therefore typically avoided\nin all cow musical compositions.\n\nFarmer John, not knowing the finer points of cow musical history, decides\nto play his favorite song over the loudspeakers in the barn.  Your task is\nto identify all the ruminant seventh chords in this song, to estimate how\nsick it will make the cows.\n\nThe song played by FJ is a series of N (1 <= N <= 20,000) notes, each an\ninteger in the range 1..88.  A ruminant seventh chord is specified by a\nsequence of C (1 <= C <= 10) distinct notes, also integers in the range\n1..88.  However, even if these notes are transposed (increased or decreased\nby a common amount), or re-ordered, the chord remains a ruminant seventh\nchord!  For example, if "4 6 7" is a ruminant seventh chord, then "3 5 6"\n(transposed by -1), "6 8 9" (transposed by +2), "6 4 7" (re-ordered), and\n"5 3 6" (transposed and re-ordered) are also ruminant seventh chords.\n\nA ruminant seventh chord is a sequence of C consecutive notes satisfying\nthe above criteria. It is therefore uniquely determined by its starting\nlocation in the song. Please determine the indices of the starting\nlocations of all of the ruminant seventh chords.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: moosick\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: A single integer: N.\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: The N notes in FJ\'"\'"\'s song, one note per line.\n\n* Line 2+N: A single integer: C.\n\n* Lines 3+N..2+N+C: The C notes in an example of a ruminant seventh\n        chord.  All transpositions and/or re-orderings of these notes\n        are also ruminant seventh chords.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n6\n1\n8\n5\n7\n9\n10\n3\n4\n6\n7\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nFJ\'"\'"\'s song is 1,8,5,7,9,10.  A ruminant seventh chord is some\ntransposition/re-ordering of 4,6,7.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: A count, K, of the number of ruminant seventh chords that\n        appear in FJ\'"\'"\'s song.  Observe that different instances of\n        ruminant seventh chords can overlap each-other.\n\n* Lines 2..1+K: Each line specifies the starting index of a ruminant\n        seventh chord (index 1 is the first note in FJ\'"\'"\'s song, index N\n        is the last).  Indices should be listed in increasing sorted\n        order.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n2\n2\n4\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nTwo ruminant seventh chords appear in FJ\'"\'"\'s song (and these occurrences\nactually overlap by one note).  The first is 8,5,7 (transposed by +1 and\nreordered) starting at index 2, and the second is 7,9,10 (transposed by +3)\nstarting at index 4.\n\n[END PROBLEM]\'', 'Enter']
