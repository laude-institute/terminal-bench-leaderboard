[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Moo Sick [Rob Seay]

Everyone knows that cows love to listen to all forms of music.  Almost all
forms, that is -- the great cow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Moozart
once discovered that a specific chord tends to make cows rather ill.  This
chord, known as the ruminant seventh chord, is therefore typically avoided
in all cow musical compositions.

Farmer John, not knowing the finer points of cow musical history, decides
to play his favorite song over the loudspeakers in the barn.  Your task is
to identify all the ruminant seventh chords in this song, to estimate how
sick it will make the cows.

The song played by FJ is a series of N (1 <= N <= 20,000) notes, each an
integer in the range 1..88.  A ruminant seventh chord is specified by a
sequence of C (1 <= C <= 10) distinct notes, also integers in the range
1..88.  However, even if these notes are transposed (increased or decreased
by a common amount), or re-ordered, the chord remains a ruminant seventh
chord!  For example, if "4 6 7" is a ruminant seventh chord, then "3 5 6"
(transposed by -1), "6 8 9" (transposed by +2), "6 4 7" (re-ordered), and
"5 3 6" (transposed and re-ordered) are also ruminant seventh chords.

A ruminant seventh chord is a sequence of C consecutive notes satisfying
the above criteria. It is therefore uniquely determined by its starting
location in the song. Please determine the indices of the starting
locations of all of the ruminant seventh chords.

PROBLEM NAME: moosick

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N.

* Lines 2..1+N: The N notes in FJ's song, one note per line.

* Line 2+N: A single integer: C.

* Lines 3+N..2+N+C: The C notes in an example of a ruminant seventh
        chord.  All transpositions and/or re-orderings of these notes
        are also ruminant seventh chords.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
1
8
5
7
9
10
3
4
6
7

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's song is 1,8,5,7,9,10.  A ruminant seventh chord is some
transposition/re-ordering of 4,6,7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A count, K, of the number of ruminant seventh chords that
        appear in FJ's song.  Observe that different instances of
        ruminant seventh chords can overlap each-other.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line specifies the starting index of a ruminant
        seventh chord (index 1 is the first note in FJ's song, index N
        is the last).  Indices should be listed in increasing sorted
        order.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2
2
4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Two ruminant seventh chords appear in FJ's song (and these occurrences
actually overlap by one note).  The first is 8,5,7 (transposed by +1 and
reordered) starting at index 2, and the second is 7,9,10 (transposed by +3)
starting at index 4.

**Developing the solution**

The user is looking for a complete solution involving restatement, conceptualization, pseudocode, and outputting a Python file called solution.py, without any c
ode modifications needed. Since I can create files in this environment, I’ll go ahead with that. I need to think about the algorithm, specifically using sliding
 windows of length C in an array of N notes. Each window's multiset of differences must match a target, drawing on the idea that each chord's notes are distinct
 integers. I'll explore checking windows by focusing on differences to form a consistent interval signature.
**Defining the approach**

First, I need to sort the chord example list and create the target intervals by calculating the differences between consecutive sorted notes. For each sliding w
indow of notes from the song, I’ll sort the window and compute its intervals. If these match the target intervals, it’s a match. Sorting the windows costs a tri
vial amount of time given the constraints. I must ensure that chord examples are distinct because duplicates in windows would create interval mismatches. Finall
y, I’ll read inputs, precompute intervals, and account for the edge case of a single note in chords.
**Structuring the response**

The user wants me to reason through the problem step by step: first, to restate the task; next, to conceptualize it; then outline pseudocode; and finally, to sa
ve the solution as solution.py. I’ll start by clearly restating the objectives, followed by conceptual ideas and pseudocode to clarify the algorithm.

Once that’s done, I’ll let the user know I'm creating the solution.py file with the Python implementation. After that, I'll proceed with applying the changes to
 create the file.

Here’s the breakdown:

**Restatement**
Identify every starting index in a song’s note sequence where a window of C consecutive notes forms a transposed and/or reordered version of a given chord patte
rn.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort the example chord notes and compute the successive differences (interval signature).
- For each window of length C in the song:
  - Sort the window’s notes and compute its interval signature.
  - If it matches the target signature, record the window’s 1-based start index.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read song[N]
read C
read chord[C]
base = sort(chord)
target_intervals = [base[i] - base[i-1] for each adjacent pair]
results = []
for i from 0 to N-C:
    window = song[i:i+C]
    win_sorted = sort(window)
    win_intervals = [win_sorted[j] - win_sorted[j-1] for each adjacent pair]
    if win_intervals == target_intervals:
        results.append(i+1)
print len(results)
for each idx in results:
    print idx
```
