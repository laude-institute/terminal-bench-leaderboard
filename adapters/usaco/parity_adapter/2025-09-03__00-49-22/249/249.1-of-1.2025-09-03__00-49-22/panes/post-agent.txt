[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Route Designing [Yan Gu, 2013]

After escaping from the farm, Bessie has decided to start a travel
agency along the Amoozon river.  There are several tourist sites
located on both sides of the river, each with an integer value
indicating how interesting the tourist site is.

Tourist sites are connected by routes that cross the river (i.e.,
there are no routes connecting a site with a site on the same side of
the river).  Bessie wants to design a tour for her customers and needs
your help.  A tour is a sequence of tourist sites with adjacent sites
connected by a route. In order to best serve her customers she wants
to find the route that maximizes the sum of the values associated with
each visited site.

However, Bessie may be running several of these tours at the same
time.  Therefore it's important that no two routes on a tour
intersect.  Two routes (a <-> x) and (b <-> y) intersect if and only
if (a < b and y < x) or (b < a and x < y) or (a = b and x = y).

Help Bessie find the best tour for her agency.  Bessie may start and end at
any site on either side of the Amoozon.

PROBLEM NAME: route

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space separated integers N (1 <= N <= 40,000), M (1 <=
        M <= 40,000), and R (0 <= R <= 100,000) indicating
        respectively the number of sites on the left side of the
        river, the number of sites on the right side of the river, and
        the number of routes.

* Lines 2..N+1: The (i+1)th line has a single integer, L_i (0 <= L_i
        <= 40,000), indicating the value of the ith tourist site on
        the left side of the river.

* Lines N+2..N+M+1: The (i+N+1)th line has a single integer, R_i (0 <=
        R_i <= 40,000), indicating the value of the ith tourist site
        on the right side of the river.

* Lines N+M+2..N+M+R+1: Each line contains two space separated
        integers I (1 <= I <= N) and J (1 <= J <= M) indicating there
        is a bidirectional route between site I on the left side of
        the river and site J on the right side of the river.

of the river.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum sum of values
        attainable on a tour.

**Exploring edge connections**

I'm considering a path that alternates between left and right, where edges connect left indices to right indices. If I choose edges in sequence, I need to ensur
e that no pairs of edges intersect. To avoid crossing, if a<b, then the right endpoint y must be greater than or equal to x. So, sorting the left indices increa
singly while keeping the right endpoints non-decreasing will prevent intersections. I'm essentially looking for an increasing sequence in a 2D arrangement.
**Analyzing node values and paths**

I'm working on the problem of summing node values along a path where nodes can only be counted once. Even though the constraints seem unclear, it's implied that
 paths cannot revisit nodes, preventing cycles due to the monotonic increase in indices. This bipartite structure enforces an alternating sequence on both sides
. Starting from any node without edges means its value stands alone. To optimize the path, I'll use dynamic programming, sorting edges by left and right indices
 and tracking the best path values at each edge.
**Understanding edge constraints in paths**

I'm examining how values are counted along edges that can share endpoints, focusing on the crossing constraints. My dynamic programming approach involves sortin
g edges by left and right indices, tracking states for paths ending at left or right nodes. It's essential to ensure that paths don't cross. While edges can sha
re endpoints, the path must follow specific rules. This leads to a structure akin to a bipartite graph, allowing for a maximum weight path solution using direct
ed edges. But, I need to ensure that the directed paths satisfy non-crossing conditions throughout.
**Maximizing path sums with edges**

I'm figuring out how to compute the best path values across edges sorted by their left and right nodes. The process involves using dynamic programming (DP) to k
eep track of the best paths ending at either side. I can combine values from edges while ensuring they don't cross. By treating endpoints as states instead of e
dges, I can apply a method to facilitate the DP updates. Each tour forms a path with non-crossing edges, resembling a bipartite graph. The planning, progression
, and crossing constraints all play critical roles as I structure the path.
**Implementing dynamic programming for edges**

I'm working on a dynamic programming approach to maximize path sums through edges sorted by their endpoints. For each edge, I will compute possible chain values
, ensuring I only consider edges that maintain non-crossing constraints. I'll track the best path values across left and right endpoints. By processing edges in
 sorted order, I can update my path values efficiently. After testing with sample edges, I’ll finalize the logic and implement it in Python, handling various ed
ge cases appropriately. Time complexity looks good, too!

**Exploring path constraints**

I need to outline a path where nodes can't be revisited, and all edges must be non-crossing during the entire tour. The goal is to maximize the sum of node weig
hts. This problem feels similar to finding the longest path on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) due to the ordering constraints on edges. If I have multiple edges
, their left indices must maintain a non-decreasing order with corresponding right indices. Also, I can't repeat any edges in this setup.
**Clarifying edge conditions**

I need to define a rule for edges in the tour: for two edges (a,x) and (b,y), they shouldn't intersect. If a<b, then y must be greater than or equal to x; if a>
b, y should be less than or equal to x. I realize that as I move through the tour, both left and right indices have to either increase or decrease together.

The path alternates, starting with edges going from left to right, so I must ensure the edges don’t crossing and remain sorted by their indices. Ideally, the pa
th will be monotonic and avoid revisiting nodes. This creates a weighted path in a DAG where edges link correctly to maintain the non-crossing condition, ultima
tely forming a valid path.
**Understanding edge connections**

I need to ensure that consecutive edges in a path share endpoints. For example, if I have edge e = (l1, r1) and the next e' = (l2, r2), they should connect thro
ugh nodes without revisiting them. Each edge alternates between left and right nodes, so if one ends at a right node, the next must start at that node.

I see that to maintain a valid path, the edges must not cross, requiring careful management of their indices. This translates to a non-crossing path where left
and right indices stay ordered. So, good edges should either have increasing left indices or maintain consistent right indices across a defined sequence. This d
ynamic programming approach helps maximize the weight while keeping track of connections.
**Analyzing edge traversal**

I'm considering how consecutive edges share endpoints. For edges (1,1) and (3,1), they don’t cross, which is good. I realize that with the weights, I can calcul
ate the sum effectively. However, I wonder if going through edges (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) might yield a different outcome. It seems I could set up a dynamic pro
gramming solution based on the adjacency of edges.

The idea forms that I can create a new graph, linking edges that share endpoints, and ensure a non-crossing structure. By processing edges in order while mainta
ining these constraints, I can sum the weights properly. This complex arrangement still maps well to how I handle dynamic programming on a directed graph, allow
ing me to establish a maximal length path while respecting the necessary non-crossing criteria.
**Structuring dynamic programming**

I'm thinking about how the path must increase both coordinates in a monotonic fashion. This means that for a left node, the last indices must be tracked. To set
 up my dynamic programming (DP) solution, I’m defining pairs of edges (i,j) and considering how to gather weights while avoiding double-counting.

I need to adjust calculations based on transitions and shared endpoints, ensuring I only include unique weights from nodes. By processing edges in a specific or
der and maintaining best paths dynamically, I’m aiming for an approach that captures the acyclic nature of the problem while ensuring those constraints are resp
ected.

ate the sum effectively. However, I wonder if going through edges (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) might yield a different outcome. It seems I could set up a dynamic pro
gramming solution based on the adjacency of edges.

The idea forms that I can create a new graph, linking edges that share endpoints, and ensure a non-crossing structure. By processing edges in order while mainta
ining these constraints, I can sum the weights properly. This complex arrangement still maps well to how I handle dynamic programming on a directed graph, allow
ing me to establish a maximal length path while respecting the necessary non-crossing criteria.

**Structuring dynamic programming**

I'm thinking about how the path must increase both coordinates in a monotonic fashion. This means that for a left node, the last indices must be tracked. To set
 up my dynamic programming (DP) solution, I’m defining pairs of edges (i,j) and considering how to gather weights while avoiding double-counting.

I need to adjust calculations based on transitions and shared endpoints, ensuring I only include unique weights from nodes. By processing edges in a specific or
der and maintaining best paths dynamically, I’m aiming for an approach that captures the acyclic nature of the problem while ensuring those constraints are resp
ected.

**Problem Restatement**
We have two parallel banks of the Amoozon: a left bank with N sites and a right bank with M sites. Each site has a non‐negative “interest” weight. There are R b
idirectional routes, each connecting one left site i to one right site j. A *tour* is any walk that alternates banks via these routes. We must pick a tour whose
 routes do not “cross” (if you draw left and right sites in order, no two chosen routes intersect) and that maximizes the total interest sum of the *visited* si
tes. Tours may start/end anywhere and may use each route at most once.

**High-Level Solution**
1.  Model each route (i,j) as a grid point with weight L[i]+R[j].
2.  Maintain two DP arrays per route:
    - dpV[i,j]: best sum for a tour *ending* at left site i via route (i,j)
    - dpH[i,j]: best sum for a tour *ending* at right site j via route (i,j)
3.  Enforce non‐crossing and no‐reuse by only allowing transitions in two ways:
    - **Vertical (R→L)** along the same column j, strictly increasing row i:
      dpV[i,j] = max( L[i]+R[j],  max_{k<i}( dpH[k,j] + L[i] ) )
    - **Horizontal (L→R)** along the same row i, strictly increasing column j:
      dpH[i,j] = max( L[i]+R[j],  max_{ℓ<j}( dpV[i,ℓ] + R[j] ) )
4.  Process all routes grouped by left‐index i in ascending order. Within each row:
   - First compute all dpV[i,j] using best dpH so far in column j.
   - Then compute dpH[i,j] in ascending j, using only dpV[i,ℓ] for ℓ<j.
   - Update global maxima and carry forward the best dpH per column for the next rows.
5.  Also consider single‐site tours (no routes) by taking max(L_i, R_j).

This runs in O(R log R+N+M+R) time and O(N+M+R) space.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M, R
read array L[1..N], Rw[1..M]
group routes by left i: edges[i] = list of j’s
for each i: sort edges[i]

NEG = −∞
bestHcol[1..M] ← NEG   # best dpH so far in each column
answer ← max(max(L), max(Rw))

for i in 1..N:
  if edges[i] empty: continue
  # 1) compute dpV for column‐moves (R→L)
  for j in edges[i]:
    dpV[j] = L[i] + Rw[j]
    if bestHcol[j] ≠ NEG:
      dpV[j] = max(dpV[j], bestHcol[j] + L[i])
    answer = max(answer, dpV[j])

  # 2) compute dpH for row‐moves (L→R), strictly ℓ<j
  bestVrow = NEG
  for j in edges[i]:   # in ascending j
    old = bestVrow
    bestVrow = max(bestVrow, dpV[j])
    dpH = L[i] + Rw[j]
    if old ≠ NEG:
      dpH = max(dpH, old + Rw[j])
    answer = max(answer, dpH)
    tmpH[j] = dpH

  # 3) carry dpH forward to future rows
  for j in edges[i]:
    bestHcol[j] = max(bestHcol[j], tmpH[j])
    remove tmpH[j]

print answer
```
