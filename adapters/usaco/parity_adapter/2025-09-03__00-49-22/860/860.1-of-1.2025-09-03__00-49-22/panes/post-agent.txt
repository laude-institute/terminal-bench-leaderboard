[BEGIN PROBLEM]
With plenty of free time on their hands (or rather, hooves), the cows on Farmer
John's farm often pass the time by playing video games.  One of their favorites
is based on a popular human video game called Puyo Puyo; the cow version is of
course called Mooyo Mooyo.

The game of Mooyo Mooyo is played on a tall narrow grid $N$ cells tall
($1 \leq N \leq 100$) and 10 cells wide.  Here is an example with $N = 6$:


0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054502230
2211122220
1111111223

Each cell is either empty (indicated by a 0), or a haybale in one of nine
different colors (indicated by characters 1..9).  Gravity causes haybales to
fall downward, so there is never a 0 cell below a haybale.

Two cells belong to the same connected region if they are directly adjacent
either horizontally or vertically, and they have the same nonzero color.  Any
time a connected region exists with at least $K$ cells, its haybales all
disappear, turning into zeros.  If multiple such connected regions exist at the
same time, they all disappear simultaneously.  Afterwards, gravity might cause
haybales to fall downward to fill some of the resulting cells that became zeros.
In the resulting configuration, there may again be connected regions of size at
least $K$ cells.  If so, they also disappear (simultaneously, if there are
multiple such regions), then gravity pulls the remaining cells downward, and the
process repeats until no connected regions of size at least $K$ exist.

Given the state of a Mooyo Mooyo board, please output a final picture of the
board after these operations have occurred.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 10N$). The
remaining $N$ lines specify the initial state of the board.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output $N$ lines, describing a picture of the final board state.

SAMPLE INPUT:
6 3
0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054502230
2211122220
1111111223
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000000
2254500000

In the example above, if $K = 3$, then there is a connected region of size at
least $K$ with color 1 and also one with color 2.  Once these are simultaneously
removed, the board temporarily looks like this:


0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054500030
2200000000
0000000003

Then, gravity takes effect and the haybales drop to this configuration:


0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000300
2254500333

Again, there is a region of size at least $K$ (with color 3).  Removing it
yields the final board configuration:


0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000000
2254500000

[2025-09-03T06:15:54] thinking

**Planning the grid algorithm**

I need to read N and K, and then gather the grid of strings to find connected components. I’ll use BFS or DFS to explore each non-zero unvisited cell. If I find
 a component larger than K, I'll mark it for deletion by turning those cells into '0'. After that, I need to apply gravity to the grid, which means I’ll shift n
on-zero cells down. Considering the size limits, I think I’ll choose DFS with a stack for safety. Lastly, I’ll print the updated rows.
**Designing the grid solution**

First, I need to read N and K, and then initialize the grid from input. I’ll loop indefinitely while marking unvisited cells and finding connected components us
ing DFS. If a component size is greater than or equal to K, those cells will be marked for deletion. After that, I’ll set those cells to '0' and apply gravity b
y moving non-zero cells down. Finally, I’ll print the updated grid. I’ll implement this in a Python script with a main function. Let's proceed with the solution
!

1. Problem Restatement
Cows play Mooyo Mooyo on an \(N\times10\) grid of digits (\(0\)–\(9\)). Zeros are empty; 1–9 are colored haybales. Repeatedly, any connected group (4-directiona
l) of the same nonzero digit of size at least \(K\) disappears (becomes zeros) simultaneously, then gravity pulls remaining haybales down. Continue until no mor
e groups of size ≥ \(K\) remain. Output the final grid.

2. Solution Concept
- Read \(N,K\) and the grid.
- Loop until nothing is removed:
  - Flood-fill (DFS) to find all connected same-color components.
  - If a component has size ≥ \(K\), mark its cells for deletion.
  - If any deletions, set those to ‘0’ and then apply gravity column by column by compacting non-zeros downward.
- Print the resulting grid.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K
grid ← list of N rows (each a list of chars)
repeat:
  visited ← Nx10 false matrix
  to_delete ← empty list
  for each cell (i,j):
    if grid[i][j]!='0' and not visited[i][j]:
      color ← grid[i][j]
      comp ← DFS stack from (i,j), marking visited, collecting same-color cells
      if size(comp) ≥ K: to_delete.extend(comp)
  if to_delete empty: break
  for each (x,y) in to_delete: grid[x][y]='0'
  for each column c in 0..9:
    write ← N-1
    for row from N-1 down to 0:
      if grid[row][c]!='0': grid[write][c]=grid[row][c]; write--
    for row from write down to 0: grid[row][c]='0'
print grid rows
```

4. Implementation
The solution has been saved to `solution.py`. It reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests!
