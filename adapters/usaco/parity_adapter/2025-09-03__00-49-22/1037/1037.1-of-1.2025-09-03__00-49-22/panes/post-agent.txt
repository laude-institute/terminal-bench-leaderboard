[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is worried for the health of his cows (conveniently numbered
$1 \ldots N$ as always) after an outbreak of the  highly contagious bovine
disease COWVID-19.

Recently, Farmer John tested all of his cows and found some of them to be
positive for the disease.  Using video footage from inside his barn, he is able
to review recent interactions between pairs of cows --- it turns out that when
cows greet each-other, they shake hooves, a gesture that can unfortunately
spread the infection from one cow to another.  Farmer John assembles a
time-stamped list of interacting pairs of cows, with entries of the form
$(t, x, y)$, meaning that at time $t$, cow $x$ shook hooves with cow $y$.
Farmer John also knows the following:

(i) Exactly one cow on his farm could have started out carrying the disease
(we'll call this cow "patient zero").

(ii) Once a cow is infected, she passes the infection along with her next $K$
hoof shakes (possibly including the same partner cow several times).  After
shaking hooves $K$ times, she no longer passes the infection along with
subsequent hoof shakes (since at this point she realizes she is spreading the
infection and washes her hooves carefully).

(iii) Once a cow is infected, she stays infected.

Unfortunately, Farmer John doesn't know which of his $N$ cows is patient zero,
nor does he know the value of $K$!  Please help him narrow down the
possibilities for these unknowns based on his data. It is guaranteed that at
least one possibility is valid.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100$) and $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 250$).  The next line contains a string of length $N$ whose
entries are 0s and 1s,  describing the current state of Farmer John's $N$ cows
--- 0 represents a healthy cow and 1 represents a cow presently with the
disease.  Each of the next $T$ lines describes a record in Farmer John's list of
interactions and consists of three integers $t$, $x$, and $y$, where $t$ is a
positive integer time of the interaction ($t \leq 250$) and $x$ and $y$ are
distinct integers in the range $1 \ldots N$, indicating which cows shook hands
at time $t$. At most one interaction happens at each point in time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single line with three integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, where $x$ is the
number of possible cows who could have been patient zero, $y$ is the smallest
possible value of $K$ consistent with the data, and $z$ is the largest possible
value of $K$ consistent with the data (if there is no upper bound on $K$ that
can be deduced from the data, print "Infinity" for $z$). Note that it might be
possible to have $K=0$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1100
7 1 2
5 2 3
6 2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 1 Infinity

The only candidate for patient zero is cow 1. For all $K>0$, cow 1 infects cow 2
at time 7, while cows 3 and 4 remain uninfected.

[2025-09-03T05:27:23] thinking

**Analyzing cow infection dynamics**

I’m considering how to track the infection spread among cows during hoof shakes. The rules state that cows only transmit infection after they’ve been infected f
or a specific number of shakes. So, I’ll need to focus on counting the shakes that happen after a cow gets infected.

If two infected cows shake hooves, it’s counted but has no effect. I need to simulate each handshake and carefully check the infection status and shake counts f
or each cow. This feels a bit complicated, but I’m getting there!
**Clarifying infection rules for cows**

I’m tackling the rules around infection and hoof shakes. If a cow is infected and has completed K shakes, it can no longer infect others, but it can still shake
 hooves, right? So my understanding is that I should still count all shakes, even past K, but for infection purposes, I’ll only care about whether the count is
less than or equal to K when judging if a cow can infect another.

I think I need to increment the shake count for every handshake, regardless of infection status, while being careful about the timing of infection during the ha
ndshake.
**Refining infection transmission logic**

I’m working through how infection passes during hoof shakes. If one cow infects another in a handshake, the newly infected cow shouldn't count that shake for th
eir infection tally. It seems crucial that we evaluate each cow's infected status and their shake count before the handshake occurs to determine potential infec
tions accurately.

I need to make sure that newly infected cows start with a shake count of zero, meaning they can’t infect anyone until their next handshake. This is a bit comple
x, but tracking these interactions in order should help clarify the infection spread!

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Restatement**
   We have \(N\) cows (numbered 1…\(N\)), one of which is patient zero who starts infected. We observed \(T\) time-stamped pairwise handshakes. An infected cow
will infect her handshake partner for her next \(K\) total shakes after becoming infected, then stops infecting thereafter (but stays infected). Given the final
 infection statuses (0/1), we must count how many cows could be patient zero, and among all consistent \((\text{patient},K)\) pairs, report the smallest \(K\) a
nd the largest \(K\) (or “Infinity” if unbounded).

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - Parse inputs and sort interactions by time.
   - Brute-force each cow as patient zero, and for each \(K\) from 0 to \(T\), simulate transmissions in chronological order.
   - Track for each cow whether infected, and how many shakes she’s done since infection. For each handshake, any infected cow with shakes < \(K\) infects the p
artner, then increments her own shake count. Newly infected cows begin with 0 shakes (and do not infect on that same handshake).
   - After all interactions, compare the simulated infection pattern to the observed one. Collect all valid \((\text{cow},K)\).
   - Count possible patient zeros, take the global minimum \(K\) over all valid pairs, and if any valid pair uses \(K=T\), treat the maximum as Infinity; otherw
ise take the maximum finite \(K\).

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   read N, T
   read infection_string
   read list of (time, x, y) interactions
   sort interactions by time

   valid_patient_count = 0
   global_Ks = {}
   infinite = false

   for patient in 1..N:
     valid_Ks = {}
     inf_flag = false
     for K in 0..T:
       initialize infected[N] = false; infected[patient] = true
       initialize shakes[N] = 0
       for each (t,x,y) in interactions:
         newly = []
         if infected[x] and shakes[x] < K: newly.append(y)
         if infected[y] and shakes[y] < K: newly.append(x)
         if infected[x]: shakes[x] += 1
         if infected[y]: shakes[y] += 1
         for c in newly: infected[c] = true
       if infected matches infection_string:
         valid_Ks.add(K)
         if K == T: inf_flag = true
     if valid_Ks not empty:
       valid_patient_count += 1
       global_Ks |= valid_Ks
       if inf_flag: infinite = true

   min_K = min(global_Ks)
   max_K = "Infinity" if infinite else max(global_Ks)
   print(valid_patient_count, min_K, max_K)
   ```
