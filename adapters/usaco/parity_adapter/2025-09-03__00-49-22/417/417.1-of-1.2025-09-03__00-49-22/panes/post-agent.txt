[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Mooo Moo [silver] [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has completely forgotten how many cows he owns!  He is too
embarrassed to go to his fields to count the cows, since he doesn't want
the cows to realize his mental lapse.  Instead, he decides to count his
cows secretly by planting microphones in the fields in which his cows tend
to gather, figuring that he can determine the number of cows from the total
volume of all the mooing he hears.

FJ's N fields (1 <= N <= 100) are all arranged in a line along a long
straight road.  Each field might contain several types of cows; FJ
owns cows that come from B different breeds (1 <= B <= 20), and a cow
of breed i moos at a volume of V(i) (1 <= V(i) <= 100).  Moreover,
there is a strong wind blowing down the road, which carries the sound
of mooing in one direction from left to right: if the volume of mooing
in some field is X, then in the next field this will contribute X-1 to
the total mooing volume (and X-2 in the field after that, etc.).
Otherwise stated, the mooing volume in a field is the sum of the
contribution due to cows in that field, plus X-1, where X is the total
mooing volume in the preceding field.

Given the volume of mooing that FJ records in each field, please compute
the minimum possible number of cows FJ might own.

The volume FJ records in any field is at most 100,000.

PROBLEM NAME: mooomoo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integers N and B.

* Lines 2..1+B: Line i+1 contains the integer V(i).

* Lines 2+B..1+B+N: Line 1+B+i contains the total volume of all mooing
        in field i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 2
5
7
0
17
16
20
19

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ owns 5 fields, with mooing volumes 0,17,16,20,19.  There are two breeds
of cows; the first moos at a volume of 5, and the other at a volume of 7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows owned by FJ, or -1 if there is no
        configuration of cows consistent with the input.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 2 cows of breed #1 and 1 cow of breed #2 in field 2, and there is
another cow of breed #1 in field 4.

**Implementing the USACO Solver**

I'm outlining the approach for the USACO problem "Mooo Moo." We have N fields, each with a recorded volume M[i] and B breeds, where each breed j has a specific
moo volume V[j]. In field i, C[i][j] represents the count of breed j cows. The equation M[i] = sum_j C[i][j] * V[j] includes an effect from the previous field's
 volume. It looks like I need to clarify how the "wind" reduces this contribution. If the previous volume is zero, that should not negatively affect the next fi
eld's calculations.
**Clarifying the Mooo Moo Problem**

I think M[i] should be equal to the sum of cow volumes plus the contribution from the previous field using max(M[i-1]-1, 0). In the sample, when M[1]=0, the con
tribution becomes -1, but we shouldn't subtract that. Rather, it indicates no contribution is made, so we effectively ignore negatives. So, contributions occur
only when positive. This leads to defining carry[i] as max(0, M_rec[i-1] - 1).

I also realize that finding the minimal cow count for each target volume across all fields resembles an unbounded knapsack problem, where we need to ensure effi
cient calculations given the constraints.
**Planning the USACO Solution**

I think the better approach is to precompute a dynamic programming (DP) array for the unbounded knapsack problem to minimize the number of cows needed. The form
ula for DP would be dp[x] = minimum cows to sum to x, where dp[0]=0. I need to ensure that cows_vol[i] remains non-negative, so I’ll have to validate that M[i]
is at least as large as carry[i]; otherwise, it would lead to negative values.

Once I compute the cows_vol and check for feasibility, I can implement the solution in Python. I'll also set up a pseudocode framework that I can follow, making
 sure to loop through the necessary values to fill the DP array and then sum for the final output.

I’ve implemented the solution in `solution.py`, which:

- Reads inputs for fields, breeds, moo volumes.
- Computes per-field cow-only volumes after subtracting wind carry.
- Uses unbounded knapsack DP to find the minimal cows for each volume.
- Aggregates the total or reports `-1` if impossible.

Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or sample cases.
