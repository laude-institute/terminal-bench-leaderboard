He is too\nembarrassed to go to his fields to count the cows, since he doesn't want\nthe cows to realize his mental lapse.  Instead, he decides to count his\ncows secretly by planting microphones in the fields in which his cows tend\nto gather, figuring that he can determine the number of cows from the total\nvolume of all the mooing he hears.\n\nFJ's N fields (1 <= N <= 100) are all arranged in a line along a long\nstraight road.  Each field might contain several types of cows; FJ\nowns cows that come from B different breeds (1 <= B <= 20), and a cow\nof breed i moos at a volume of V(i) (1 <= V(i) <= 100).  Moreover,\nthere is a strong wind blowing down the road, which carries the sound\nof mooing in one direction from left to right: if the volume of mooing\nin some field is X, then in the next field this will contribute X-1 to\nthe total mooing volume (and X-2 in the field after that, etc.).\nOtherwise stated, the mooing volume in a field is the sum of the\ncontribution due to cows in that field, plus X-1, where X is the total\nmooing volume in the preceding field.\n\nGiven the volume of mooing that FJ records in each field, please compute\nthe minimum possible number of cows FJ might own.\n\nThe volume FJ records in any field is at most 100,000.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: mooomoo\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The integers N and B.\n\n* Lines 2..1+B: Line i+1 contains the integer V(i).\n\n* Lines 2+B..1+B+N: Line 1+B+i contains the total volume of all mooing\n        in field i.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n5 2\n5\n7\n0\n17\n16\n20\n19\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nFJ owns 5 fields, with mooing volumes 0,17,16,20,19.  There are two breeds\nof cows; the first moos at a volume of 5, and the other at a volume of 7.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The minimum number of cows owned by FJ, or -1 if there is no\n        configuration of cows consistent with the input.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n4\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 2 cows of breed #1 and 1 cow of breed #2 in field 2, and there is\nanother cow of breed #1 in field 4.\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
