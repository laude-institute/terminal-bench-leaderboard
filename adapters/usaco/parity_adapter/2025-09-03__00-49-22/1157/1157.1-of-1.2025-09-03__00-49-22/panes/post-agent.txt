[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is trying to walk from her favorite pasture back to her barn.

The pasture and farm are on an $N \times N$ grid ($2 \leq N \leq 50$), with her
pasture in the top-left corner and the barn in the bottom-right corner. Bessie
wants to get home as soon as possible, so she will only walk down and to the
right. There are haybales in some locations that Bessie cannot walk through; she
must walk around them.

Bessie is feeling a little tired today, so she wants to change the direction she
walks at most $K$ times ($1 \leq K \leq 3$) .

How many distinct paths can Bessie walk from her favorite pasture to the barn?
Two paths are distinct if Bessie walks in a square in one path but not in the
other.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input for each test case contains $T$ sub-test cases, each describing a
different farm and each of which must be  answered correctly to pass the full
test case.  The first line of input  contains $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 50$).  Each of
the $T$ sub-test cases follow.

Each sub-test case starts with a line containing $N$ and $K$.

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of $N$ characters. Each character is
either $\texttt{.}$ if it is empty or $\texttt{H}$ if it has a haybale. It is
guaranteed the top-left and bottom-right corners of the farm will not contain
haybales.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $T$ lines, the $i$th line containing the number of distinct paths Bessie
can take in the $i$th sub-test case.

We'll denote Bessie's possible paths as strings of D's and R's, indicating that
Bessie moved either down or right, respectively.

In the first sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the second sub-test case, Bessie's four possible walks are DDRR, DRRD, RDDR,
and RRDD.

In the third sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRR, DRDR, DRRD,
RDDR, RDRD, and RRDD.

In the fourth sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the fifth and sixth sub-test cases, it is impossible for Bessie to walk back
to the barn.

In the seventh sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRDRR, DDRRDR,
DDRRRD, RRDDDR, RRDDRD, and RRDRDD.

SCORING:
Test case 2 satisfies $K = 1$.Test cases 3-5 satisfy $K = 2$.Test cases 6-10 satisfy $K = 3$.

[2025-09-03T05:24:58] thinking

**Evaluating pathfinding constraints**

I need to solve a problem with an N x N grid containing obstacles, where I start at (0,0) and aim for (N-1,N-1). I can only move right or down, and I have a max
imum of K (up to 3) direction changes. Since N can be as large as 50, a brute-force method to count paths would be impractical due to the grid size. Instead, I
should use dynamic programming to track the position, number of direction changes, and the last move's direction.
**Defining initial movement conditions**

At the beginning, I haven't moved yet, which leaves the initial direction undefined. I think I need to handle this first move differently since moving either do
wn or right doesn't actually count as a direction change. I could define the starting direction as both options and track changes based on how they differ.

So, if (0,1) is free, I set dp[0][1][0][1] = 1, and similarly for moving down. Then, I'll iterate through the grid while managing direction changes, ensuring tr
ansitions respect the constraints. The overall complexity seems manageable within my constraints.
**Implementing solution requirements**

I see that since "No outside libraries are allowed," I can only use built-in functions. I should create a new file called solution.py and produce the final answ
er without needing to update any plans, as it's a straightforward task. I won't use apply_patch, but I'll generate the file directly. My plan includes restating
 the problem, conceptualizing it, writing pseudocode, and finally coding the solution in solution.py using dynamic programming. Let's get started!
