and a vertical list of emails on the right side of the screen. There are $M$

**Considering email sorting**

I’m working through a problem about sorting emails by dragging them into folders while keeping some constraints on scrolling. We have a range of emails that need to be organized into specific folders. We can only scroll down to reveal more folders and emails, but if we file one of the last emails visible on the screen, we can scroll up to manage the view. This means starting at the first email and adjusting the list as we drag emails into their respective folders.
**Analyzing email processing**

I'm tackling a challenge where I can't scroll the email window up. However, if I’m viewing the last K emails, removing one shifts the window to reflect the last K of the new list, effectively adjusting my starting point. My goal is to determine if I can process the folder list sequentially within these constraints. Essentially, I want to process emails in their original order, while also considering my visibility limitations. I’ll evaluate maintaining a pointer to the folder window and using a strategy that allows me to navigate through the emails efficiently.
**Simulating email processing**

I'm working on simulating an email processing system using two pointers for tracking folders and email positions. The goal is to determine if I can process emails in a specific order by managing them within defined windows. I want to use a dynamic structure to optimize the selection of emails, focusing on processing the earliest visible emails that fit the current folder view. If certain conditions aren’t met—like no visible emails or needing to scroll—I’ll have to adjust accordingly. This leads to managing the list effectively without missing any emails.
**Finalizing email processing logic**

I’m refining the logic for processing emails as I increase the folder pointer. When I do this, I need to remove any emails that cannot be processed anymore, which will help ensure I don't face impossible scenarios later on. I’ll implement a MinSegmentTree to keep track of the minimum email positions dynamically, allowing for efficient querying. This tree will help me verify conditions easily and confirm whether I can proceed. Finally, I’ll set up the necessary functions in the algorithm and prepare for coding the solution.

**Evaluating strategies for email scrolling**

I want to explore if there's a way to finish the task at hand, but I realize that a greedy strategy might need some alternation. Ideally, I might need to choose to scroll through emails first sometimes. The challenge involves determining existence and how safe it is to proceed. A simpler solution might involve grouping emails by folder and using a sliding window approach to process folders in groups. This feels more manageable and efficient.
**Identifying email processing strategy**

I’m considering how to handle email processing for folder IDs within a specified window. I can process emails in any order as long as they adhere to their original constraints. The trick is managing the K email window and determining if I can reorder. Based on an effective solution, I should always aim to process emails when possible. If not, I need to ensure there are no processable emails left before advancing. This presents some complexity, so I’ll have to think through the logic carefully.
**Refining email processing logic**

I’m realizing I can simplify the logic for email processing since scrolling only happens downwards. An email will be processed if it’s visible in both the folder and email windows simultaneously. This leads me to think of defining the range of email visibility based on their initial positions. 

After some calculation, it seems that instead of relying on a greedy approach, it may be more effective to adopt a BFS or state search strategy, taking into account the dynamic nature of processed emails and adjusting priorities effectively. There’s a lot to manage here, and balancing the scroll and process actions correctly is key to getting the result I need.
**Adjusting email processing priorities**

I’m checking the conditions for my logic. Since hi_e equals NR, I can't proceed in some ways. Given that pf is less than pf_max, I can increment it to 4. 

Now, I’m considering whether to scroll emails before incrementing pf. I think it’s better to first check if hi_e is less than NR and, if so, increase lo_e; otherwise, increment pf. I want to test this change with different samples to ensure it works well across various scenarios. Updating the priorities should help improve the outcomes.

**Preparing final answer structure**

It’s essential to restate the solution clearly per the user's request. First, I’ll outline the problem, then provide a conceptual solution, followed by pseudocode, and finally confirm that the code was saved in the file solution.py. I need to ensure I present these four parts in my final message. So, my answer will consist of the restatement, conceptual framework, pseudocode, and a note about the saved solution.py. Let’s put this together for the user!

**Problem Restatement**

We have M folders labeled 1…M and N emails in a list, each email i belongs to folder f_i. The screen shows only K folders (a contiguous block of folder IDs) and K emails (a contiguous block of the current inbox list) at a time. You can only scroll each list downward:

- Folder window start pf can increase by 1 (so it shows folders pf…pf+K−1).
- Email window start lo_e can increase by 1 (showing emails lo_e…lo_e+K−1).
- Special: if you file (remove) an email while viewing the last K emails, the window “jumps” upward one so you keep seeing the last K.

You can only drag an email into its correct folder when both its folder and its position are visible. Determine if you can file all emails.

---

**Solution Outline**

1. Compute for each email i:
   - `pf_min[i] = max(1, f_i − K + 1)`, the earliest folder-window start when folder f_i enters view.
2. Maintain:
   - `pf`, the current folder-window start (initially 1).
   - `lo_e`, the current email-window start (initially 1).
   - A segment tree over the original list positions that tracks:
     - Which emails remain (count),
     - The minimum `pf_min` among remaining emails,
     - The minimum `f_i` among remaining (to check unreachable folders).
3. Also support:
   - **kth**: map a window rank (lo_e…lo_e+K−1) to the original position.
   - **find_first(L,R, pf)**: find the earliest original position in [L…R] whose `pf_min ≤ pf`.
4. Loop until all N emails are filed:
   - Let hi_e = min(lo_e+K−1, remaining).
   - Compute original bounds L = kth(lo_e), R = kth(hi_e).
   - If `find_first(L,R,pf)` finds an email, remove it, adjust `lo_e` if we were at the last-window, and continue.
   - Else if there is some remaining email with `pf_min ≤ pf` (globally), scroll the email window directly to include the earliest such email.
   - Else if we can advance `pf` (pf < M−K+1), increment `pf` (and verify no remaining f_i < pf).
   - Otherwise no moves remain—answer NO.
5. If all emails are processed, answer YES.

This runs in O((N+M) log N) time.

**Pseudocode**

```
read T
for each test case:
  read M, N, K, f[1..N]
  pf = 1
  pf_max = max(1, M-K+1)
  for i in 1..N:
    pf_min[i] = max(1, f[i]-K+1)

  build segment tree over i=1..N storing:
    cnt[i]=1, seg_pfmin[i]=pf_min[i], seg_fmin[i]=f[i]

  lo_e = 1, remaining = N
  while remaining > 0:
    hi_e = min(lo_e+K-1, remaining)
    L = kth(lo_e), R = kth(hi_e)
    pos = find_first(L,R,pf)
    if pos exists:
      remove pos from tree
      remaining--
      if lo_e was last-window-start and this rank ≥ lo_e:
        lo_e = max(1, remaining-K+1)
      continue
    if tree.min_pfmin <= pf:
      pos0 = find_first(1,N,pf)
      rank0 = rank(pos0)
      if rank0 < lo_e: NO and break
      last_start = max(1, remaining-K+1)
      lo_e = min(rank0, last_start)
      continue
    if pf < pf_max:
      pf++
      if tree.min_fmin < pf: NO and break
      continue
    NO and break
  if all removed: YES
```
