[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

Today the cows are a bit sleepy, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive. The $k$ cows whom she passes
will amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after
them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find a sequence of instructions that sorts the
cows in the minimum number of time steps.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers:
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, indicating the starting order of the cows.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line should contain a single integer, $K$, giving the minimum number of time
steps required to sort the cows.

The second line should contain $K$ space-separated integers,
$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K$, each in the range $1 \ldots N-1$.
Furthermore, if in the $i$-th time step FJ
instructs the cow facing him to move $c_i$ paces down the line, then after $K$
time steps the cows should be in sorted order.

If there are multiple optimal instruction sequences, your program may output any
of them.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2 4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
2 2 3

**Exploring sorting permutations**

I'm considering a permutation of numbers 1 to N, and I need to sort it using specific operations. The task allows me to take the first element and move it anywh
ere from the second position to the last, shifting others forward. Essentially, this feels like a sorting process, focusing on minimizing the number of moves. T
he goal is to find out how to efficiently sort the list and track the number of positions each first element is moved during the process. Let's clarify these op
erations further!
**Analyzing sorting strategies**

I’m thinking about a classic insight: working from the end of the permutation. I can scan backward to identify the longest sorted suffix, specifically the conse
cutive sequence ending at N. This length helps determine how many operations are needed: if the suffix length is L, the answer is N - L.

This actually relates to the "sleepy sorting" problem. I need to find the largest sorted suffix, and for any elements before it, I'll perform operations to inse
rt them correctly. I can leverage binary search via a data structure to find the appropriate insertion points efficiently. Let's nail down the final steps!
**Finalizing sorting implementation**

I’m exploring how to calculate the movement positions for sorting a permutation. By finding the largest sorted suffix, I can determine how many operations are n
eeded. The formula for the number of positions moved is \((k - i - 1) + \text{rank}\), which aligns with the known "sleepy sorting" solution.

I need to implement the steps: reading the input, identifying the sorted suffix, building a sorted list of that suffix, and then using it to calculate the rank
for each cow. There's a concern about efficiency since list insertions might slow things down, but I think we can avoid inserting into the sorted list by just f
inding ranks against it. Let's finalize this code!
**Streamlining the sorting process**

I'm thinking about how the sorted region grows with each inserted cow. Instead of maintaining a separate sorted list, I can simplify by using a binary indexed t
ree (BIT) for dynamic counting. This way, I can track the rank by querying the BIT for counts of values less than each cow I'm processing.

I'll implement the BIT to efficiently update and retrieve counts. The plan is to read the input, identify the starting point of the suffix, compute movements, a
nd then output the results. Let's go ahead and create the solution file!

**Considering optimal sorting moves**

I'm thinking about how to sort a permutation with specific operations. At each step, I can only move the first element back by k positions, effectively insertin
g it after k cows to sort it. It makes me wonder if this approach is similar to finding the longest suffix of the permutation that's already increasing by one m
od N. I realize I need to minimize the number of moves, focusing on cows not in their correct position at the front while keeping correctly positioned cows unto
uched.
**Figuring out optimal sorting strategy**

I’m realizing that the front cow must always be moved if it’s not in the correct position. If the front cow is the smallest remaining, it should stay at the fro
nt, but I can’t afford to be idle by not moving it. I can choose k from 1 to N-1, so skipping moves isn’t an option. In an example with cows like [1, 2, 4, 3],
the correct cows were temporarily moved deeper to sort properly. This leads me to think that the solution hinges on maximizing the length of the longest suffix
that's already in the right order, minimizing moves in the process.
**Exploring suffix and sorting strategy**

I’m analyzing a sample to find the longest suffix in correct cyclic order. It seems that to minimize moves, I should consider using reverse operations instead.
This means that if I want to sort a permutation, I could translate moves to bring elements back to the front. I discover that if I avoid moving elements in the
trailing end, they remain where they are in the final sorted version. Ultimately, I realize that the untouched suffix must be sorted, which, in my example, is t
he number 3 at the end.
**Investigating sorting moves and strategies**

I'm exploring a problem called "Sleepy Cow Sorting," which involves optimizing moves to sort a permutation. The goal is to find the longest increasing suffix an
d calculate moves based on its index. Initially, I see I can rotate entries through N operations, but I need minimal moves. I realize I need to find the right p
osition to insert elements efficiently. This leads to my conclusion that the suffix should stay ordered, and I should analyze how to best integrate prefix eleme
nts into it while minimizing disruptions to the order for an optimal solution.
**Finalizing algorithm implementation**

I'm confirming that the algorithm requires three moves to sort the list. I need to clarify the steps: restate the problem in plain English, conceptualize the so
lution, and write pseudocode. I'll store the solution in a file named solution.py. It will include code that implements the BIT structure and computes the neces
sary moves. After setting up the outline, I’ll use a patch to create the file with the code, ensuring each section is clearly labeled for easy understanding.

I’ve implemented the requested Python 3 solution in solution.py:

1. Restatement
   - You have N cows in a line in some order. Only the cow at the very front can move back by k places (1≤k≤N−1). Find the shortest sequence of such moves to re
order them into 1,2,…,N.

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Identify the longest strictly increasing suffix (from the back). Those cows can remain untouched.
   - The remaining prefix of length k−1 must each move exactly once.
   - Use a Fenwick tree to maintain the multiset of “sorted” cows (initial suffix plus those already moved).
   - For each prefix cow, compute how many sorted cows are smaller (that’s how many it’ll pass), then add the count of still-unmoved prefix cows behind it. That
 sum is the move length.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read N and permutation p[1..N]
   k = N
   while k>1 and p[k]>p[k−1]: k--
   moves = []
   if k>1:
     init Fenwick tree on [1..N]
     for i in k..N: fenw.add(p[i],1)
     for i in 1..k−1:
       less = fenw.sum(p[i]−1)
       rem = (k−i−1)
       moves.append(less + rem)
       fenw.add(p[i],1)
   print len(moves)
   print moves…
   ```

Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or add examples!
