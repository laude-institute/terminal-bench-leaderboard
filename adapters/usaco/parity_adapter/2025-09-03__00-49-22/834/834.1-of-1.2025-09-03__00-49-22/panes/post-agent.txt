[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Keeping an eye on long term career possibilities beyond the farm, Bessie the cow
has started learning algorithms from various on-line coding websites.

Her favorite algorithm thus far is "bubble sort".  Here is Bessie's
implementation, in cow-code, for sorting an array $A$ of length $N$.


sorted = false
while (not sorted):
   sorted = true
   moo
   for i = 0 to N-2:
      if A[i+1] < A[i]:
         swap A[i], A[i+1]
         sorted = false

Apparently, the "moo" command in cow-code does nothing more than print out
"moo".  Strangely, Bessie seems to insist on including it at various points in
her code.

Given an input array, please predict how many times "moo" will be printed by
Bessie's code.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$).  The next $N$
lines  describe $A[0] \ldots A[N-1]$, each being an integer in the range
$0 \ldots 10^9$. Input elements are not guaranteed to be distinct.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the number of times "moo" is printed.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
1
5
3
8
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

**Analyzing bubble sort passes**

I'm considering bubble sort, where the number of passes equals how many iterations it takes to sort the array completely. Each pass should place the largest rem
aining unsorted value in its correct position. The key is to find the maximum number of leftward moves any element makes. I want to compute how many passes are
needed without falling into O(N^2) complexity since N can be large, up to 100k. It's all about measuring these maximum movements effectively!
**Evaluating bubble sort passes**

I'm considering how an element A[i] moves to its final index j, where the number of passes needed is determined by the maximum difference between its original i
ndex and sorted index plus one. With possible duplicates, bubble sort helps maintain stability, preserving relative order. I’ll compute the original and sorted
positions, then find out how many passes are needed until no more swaps occur. It turns out for a sample array, the maximum difference indicates the number of l
eftward movements!
**Creating solution algorithm**

I’m working on an algorithm that reads an array, builds a list of (value, index) pairs, and sorts them to maintain stability. For each position in the sorted ar
ray, I’ll track the maximum difference between the original and sorted indices. The answer will be this max difference plus one. The complexity is O(N log N), w
hich is manageable up to 100k.

Now, I plan to generate the solution file while keeping the implementation straightforward with standard libraries. I’ll include the algorithm explanation and p
seudocode, then create the corresponding solution.py file.

**Problem Restatement**
Given an array of \(N\) integers, simulate Bessie’s bubble-sort that prints “moo” once per outer pass and stops when no swaps occur. Report how many times “moo”
 is printed.

**Solution Approach**
- Each “moo” corresponds to one full pass over the array.
- Bubble sort stops after the first pass with no swaps.
- It can be shown that the number of passes equals \(\max_{i}(i_{\text{orig}} - i_{\text{sorted}}) + 1\).
- Sort the array (stably, preserving original order among equals), track each element’s original index, compute the maximum original index minus sorted position
, then add 1.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
arr = []
for i in 0..N-1:
    read value
    arr.append((value, i))
stably sort arr by value then original index
max_diff = 0
for sorted_pos, (_, orig_idx) in enumerate(arr):
    diff = orig_idx - sorted_pos
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
print(max_diff + 1)
```

I’ve created `solution.py` with a clean implementation.
