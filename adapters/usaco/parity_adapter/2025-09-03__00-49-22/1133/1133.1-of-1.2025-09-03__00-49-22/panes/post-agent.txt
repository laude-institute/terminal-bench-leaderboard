[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie is a busy computer science graduate student. However, even graduate
students need friends. As a result, Farmer John has opened a pasture with the
explicit purpose of helping Bessie and other cows form lasting friendships.

Farmer John's pasture can be regarded as a large 2D grid of square "cells"
(picture a huge chess board). Each cell is labeled with:

C if the cell contains a cow.G if the cell contains grass.. if the cell contains neither a cow nor grass.
For two distinct cows to become friends, the cows must choose to meet at  a
grass-covered square that is directly horizontally or vertically adjacent  to
both of them.  During the process, they eat the grass in the grass-covered
square, so future pairs of cows cannot use that square as a meeting point. The
same cow may become friends with more than one other cow,  but no pair of cows
may meet and become friends more than once.

Farmer John is hoping that numerous pairs of cows will meet and become friends
over time.  Please determine the maximum number of new friendships between

[2025-09-03T05:18:16] thinking

**Exploring cow and grass pairing**

I’m thinking about how to select two cows per grass cell to create pairs. This means I need to define a bipartite graph, with cows as nodes. Each grass cell adj
acent to two cows can connect those cows. If a grass cell is next to three cows, it offers multiple pairing options, but only one pair per grass will work. To m
aximize the pairing, I may need to transform this into a max flow problem, considering the bipartite nature of the grid.
**Analyzing bipartite graph structure**

I’m considering how cow nodes and grass nodes can fit into a bipartite structure. Grass nodes can be seen as edges between pairs of adjacent cows, but that mean
s cows across grass are neighbors. The alternating colors of cows on a chessboard-like grid help define connections. However, I realize that using parity makes
it impossible to maintain bipartite matching for grass cells.

Instead, I can build a complete graph for adjacent cows at each grass cell while keeping in mind the unique pair constraints, leading to a hypergraph matching c
hallenge. I should also think about using flow to identify maximum pairs at each grass node.
**Determining grass capacity and pairing**

Each grass cell can support one meeting of two cows. To simplify, I can represent each grass with two copies, both allowing exactly two flows for meetings. Then
, I’m considering a maximum matching model where cows are nodes and edges represent possible cow meetings through grass cells. I need to calculate how many gras
s cells are adjacent to at least two cows, which can help identify potential meetings. After analyzing several rows of a grid, I sum the valid grass cells to fi
nd a solution, ensuring I account for overlaps without repeating pairs.
**Mapping cow pairs to grass cells**

I’m working through the scenario where two cows can connect through adjacent grass cells. If two cows share the same two grass cells, they can only meet once, w
hich complicates pairing. I realize that counting grasses adjacent to many cows may lead to overestimation if I don’t account for overlapping pairs.

I need to model this situation as a bipartite graph where grasses connect to unique cow pairs. Each grass has a limited capacity of one, which means I must main
tain distinct counting of pairs to avoid redundancy, ultimately leading me toward a flow network approach to optimize pair selection.
**Analyzing grass and cow adjacency**

I'm considering how to manage grasses adjacent to pairs of cows, especially focusing on potential conflicts. Using a greedy approach could work, but it gets tri
cky with diagonal pairs that might share grass. A more careful examination shows that only grasses with exactly two adjacent cows could create these conflicts.

To find a solution, I need to count these grasses and check their pairs, ensuring I'm adjusting for overlaps. This method may help me avoid overestimating conne
ctions while maintaining an efficient way to navigate the grid. I'll implement this heuristic to meet the problem’s needs.

**Problem Restatement**
We have an \(N\times M\) grid. Each cell is a cow (`C`), grass (`G`), or empty (`.`). Two cows can form a friendship by meeting at a grass cell adjacent (up/dow
n/left/right) to both of them; that grass is then consumed and can’t be reused. Cows may form many friendships (with different partners), but each unordered pai
r of cows may meet at most once.  Compute the maximum number of friendships that can be formed.

---

**Solution Outline**

1. **Scan grid and record** for each grass cell the list of adjacent cows (up to 4).
2. **Count all “usable” grasses**—those with at least two adjacent cows.  Each such grass can host one friendship.
3. **Detect the only conflict case**: two cows sitting diagonally can share exactly two grass cells that are each adjacent to exactly those two cows (degree 2).
  In that scenario we’d overcount by one if we simply summed grasses.
4. **Subtract one** for each diagonal cow–cow pair whose two shared grass cells both have degree 2 (and no extra cows).

This runs in \(O(NM)\) time and uses only the standard library.

---

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
grid = [input() for _ in range(N)]

naive = 0
pair_to_deg2_count = map from tuple((r1,c1),(r2,c2)) → int

for each cell (r,c):
    if grid[r][c]=='G':
        adj = []
        for each of four directions (dr,dc):
            nr,nc = r+dr, c+dc
            if in bounds and grid[nr][nc]=='C':
                adj.append((nr,nc))
        if len(adj) >= 2:
            naive += 1
        if len(adj) == 2:
            sort adj so first<second
            pair_to_deg2_count[ (adj[0],adj[1]) ] += 1

conflicts = 0
for each pair, cnt in pair_to_deg2_count:
    if cnt == 2:
        conflicts += 1

answer = naive - conflicts
print(answer)
```

---

I’ll now save this as **solution.py**.
