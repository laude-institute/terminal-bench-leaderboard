[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow was excited to recently return to in-person learning!
Unfortunately, her instructor, Farmer John, is a very boring lecturer, and so
she ends up falling asleep in class often.

Farmer John has noticed that Bessie has not been paying attention in class. He
has asked another student in class, Elsie, to keep track of the number of times
Bessie falls asleep in a given class. There are $N$ class periods
($1\le N\le 10^5$), and Elsie logs that Bessie fell asleep $a_i$ times
($0\le a_i\le 10^6$) in the $i$-th class period. The total number of times Bessie fell
asleep across all class periods is at most $10^6$.

Elsie, feeling very competitive with Bessie, wants to make Farmer John feel like
Bessie is consistently falling asleep the same number of times in every class --
making it appear that the issue is entirely Bessie's fault, with no dependence
on Farmer John's sometimes-boring lectures. The only way Elsie may modify the
log is by combining two adjacent class periods.  For example, if
$a=[1,2,3,4,5],$ then if Elsie combines the second and third class periods the
log will become $[1,5,4,5]$.

Help Elsie compute the minimum number of modifications to the log that she needs
to make so that she can make all the numbers in the log equal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
Each input will contain $T$ ($1\le T\le 10$) test cases that should be solved
independently.

The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases to be solved. The $T$ test
cases follow, each described by a pair of lines. The first line of each pair
contains $N$, and the second contains $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$.

It is guaranteed that within each test case, the sum of all values in $a$ is at
most $10^6$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases is at
most
$10^5$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Please write $T$ lines of output, giving the minimum number of modifications
Elsie could perform to make all the log entries equal for each case.


SAMPLE INPUT:
3
6
1 2 3 1 1 1
3
2 2 3
5
0 0 0 0 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
2
0

For the first test case in this example, Elsie can change her log to consist
solely of 3s with 3 modifications.


   1 2 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 2 1
-> 3 3 3

For the second test case, Elsie can change her log to 7 with 2 modifications.


   2 2 3
-> 2 5
-> 7

For the last test case, Elsie doesn’t need to perform any operations; the log
already consists of equal entries.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-09-03T05:17:51] thinking

**Planning a Python solution**

I'm defining a clear step-by-step approach to solve the problem. First, I'll restate the problem: Given an array 'a' of N entries, we need to merge adjacent ent
ries any number of times to achieve an array where all entries are equal.

Next, I'll develop a conceptual solution and write pseudocode. I aim to implement this in Python 3 without external libraries. The constraints include handling
up to N = 1e5 with a sum of entries not exceeding 1e6. My goal is to minimize merges while ensuring that the final array entries are all equal.
**Determining merge strategy**

I figured out that the number of merges needed is N minus k, where k is the maximum number of equal-sum contiguous segments. We need to ensure that the sum S is
 divisible by k, but k can’t exceed N.

Instead of just looking for k, I can iterate over possible segment sums by examining the divisors of S. The goal is to find the maximum value of k while maintai
ning the criteria for segment sums. I'll check each sum's validity while keeping S and the maximum entry in mind. If the segment size is valid, it leads to the
minimal necessary merges.

1. Restatement
Bessie’s sleep counts over N class periods are logged in an array. We can merge adjacent periods (summing their counts) to form fewer entries. We want all entri
es equal, using the fewest merges.

2. Conceptual solution
- Let S = total sum and N initial entries. Each merge reduces the count by one. If we end with k segments of equal sum, merges = N–k.
- For any valid final segment sum s dividing S (and s ≥ max initial count), greedily scan and cut whenever a running sum reaches s; fail if it exceeds. The firs
t (smallest) s that works maximizes k = S/s and minimizes merges.

3. Pseudocode
```
read T
for each test:
  read N, array a
  S = sum(a)
  if S == 0: print(0); continue
  mx = max(a)
  divisors = sorted divisors of S ascending
  for s in divisors:
    if s < mx: continue
    curr = 0; segments = 0; valid = true
    for x in a:
      curr += x
      if curr == s:
        segments += 1; curr = 0
      elif curr > s:
        valid = false; break
    if valid and curr == 0:
      merges = N - segments
      print merges; break
```
