[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Recording the Moolympics [Brian Dean, 2014]

Being a fan of all cold-weather sports (especially those involving cows),
Farmer John wants to record as much of the upcoming winter Moolympics as
possible.

The television schedule for the Moolympics consists of N different programs
(1 <= N <= 150), each with a designated starting time and ending time.  FJ
has a dual-tuner recorder that can record two programs simultaneously.
Please help him determine the maximum number of programs he can record in
total.

PROBLEM NAME: recording

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the start and end time of a single
        program (integers in the range 0..1,000,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
0 3
6 7
3 10
1 5
2 8
1 9

INPUT DETAILS:

The Moolympics broadcast consists of 6 programs.  The first runs from time
0 to time 3, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of programs FJ can record.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can record at most 4 programs.  For example, he can record programs 1
and 3 back-to-back on the first tuner, and programs 2 and 4 on the second
tuner.

**Clarifying scheduling approach**

I need to rephrase and conceptualize the classic interval scheduling problem with two machines (or recorders). The goal is to maximize the number of scheduled i
ntervals using up to 2 overlapping intervals at the same time. I might approach this greedily! For one machine, I would sort intervals by their end times to fin
d maximum non-overlapping intervals. For two machines, I’ll maintain the end times of each, and assign intervals based on availability — maximizing the schedule
d count.
**Optimizing the scheduling approach**

I’m questioning whether the greedy algorithm for scheduling intervals on two machines is indeed optimal. This method generalizes to k machines and uses a queue
for active finish times. For each new interval sorted by end time, I find a machine that can take it. If none are available but I'm under my limit of machines,
I assign it to a new one. I need to keep track of the end times with variables. Sorting by end time, I can prioritize which machine to assign based on who frees
 up last.
**Structuring interval scheduling**

First, I need to clarify the problem. I'm working on an interval scheduling task where I have to maximize the number of intervals scheduled using two machines.
The challenge is to account for cases where start times can be zero.

Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution using a greedy approach by sorting the intervals and maintaining a list of end times for both machines. The pseudocode wil
l outline how to read the data, sort the intervals, and iterate through them to assign them to machines.

Finally, I’ll implement this in a Python file named solution.py. The steps for my solution include problem clarification, conceptualization, pseudocode drafting
, and code writing.
**Preparing final solution sections**

Alright, I’m working on the final answer, and I need to include four key components. First, I’ll provide a clear restatement of the problem in plain English to
make it easily understandable. Next, I’ll outline the conceptual solution, also in plain English, to describe my approach. Then, I’ll present the pseudocode in
a clear format. Lastly, I’ll apply the necessary updates for creating the solution.py file to implement the code. Let’s piece this together!

**1. Problem Restatement**
Given N TV programs with start and end times, and two tuners that can each record one program at a time, determine the maximum number of programs that can be re
corded in total. Programs may touch end-to-start with no overlap.

**2. Conceptual Solution**
Use a greedy interval-scheduling approach generalized to two machines:
- Sort all programs by their end times (earliest finishing first).
- Track the finish time of the last scheduled program on each of the two tuners.
- For each program in order, assign it to whichever tuner that is free (its last finish time ≤ program’s start) and that freed most recently (to leave maximum r
oom for future assignments).
- If neither tuner is free, skip that program.

This guarantees maximizing the total number of non-overlapping assignments across two tuners.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N
for i in 1..N:
    read start, end
    store interval (end, start)
sort intervals by end ascending

ends = [-inf, -inf]   // end time of last job on each tuner
count = 0

for each (end, start) in intervals:
    // pick tuner with later end-time first
    if ends[0] >= ends[1]:
        order = [0,1]
    else:
        order = [1,0]
    for tuner in order:
        if ends[tuner] <= start:
            ends[tuner] = end
            count += 1
            break

print count
```
