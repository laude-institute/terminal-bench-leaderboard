[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The highway adjacent to Farmer John's farm has recently seen a dramatic increase
in traffic, or at least so it seems to Farmer John.  To be sure, he wants to
measure the traffic flow on the highway with a set of  sensors, each capable of
measuring the rate of flow of traffic on a  segment of road.

Unfortunately, while walking through the barn one day, Farmer John trips and
drops his box of sensors into a large vat of milk, after which they no longer
work as well.  Instead of producing a single exact reading of traffic flow rate,
each sensor now outputs a range of possible values. For example, a sensor might
output the range $[7, 13]$, indicating that the rate of traffic flow on a
segment of road is no less than 7, and no greater than 13.

The highway runs for $N$ miles next to the farm, and traffic on the highway only
flows in one direction, from mile 1 towards mile $N$.  Farmer John wants to
install $N$ sensors -- one for each 1-mile segment of the highway. In some of
these segments, there are on-ramps that allow traffic to enter the highway; in each of
these cases, Farmer John will install his sensor on the on-ramp to measure
(approximately) the amount of incoming traffic.  In some segments there are
off-ramps that allows traffic to exit the highway; in each of these cases, Farmer John will
install his sensor on the off-ramp.  Each segment contains at most one ramp.
If there is no on-ramp or off-ramp in a segment of highway, Farmer John installs
a sensor on the main highway itself.

Given the readings from Farmer John's $N$ sensors, please determine the most
specific possible ranges that describe the rate of traffic flow initially on
the highway prior to mile 1 and for traffic continuing on the highway past mile
$N$.  These ranges should be consistent with all $N$ sensor readings.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$).  Each of the
remaining $N$ lines describes a 1-mile segment of the road, in order from mile
$1$ to mile $N$.  Each line contains a string that is either "on" (if there is
an on-ramp on this segment), "off" (if there is an off-ramp), or "none" (if
there is no ramp), followed by two integers  in the range $0 \ldots 1000$,
indicating the lower and upper endpoints of the sensor range from this segment.
If the segment contains a ramp, the sensor reading is from the ramp.  Otherwise,
it is from the main highway.  At least one of the highway segments will be
designated as "none".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line of output should contain two integers giving the most specific
range possible for the rate of traffic flow prior to mile 1.  The second line of
output should contain two integers giving the most specific range possible for
the rate of traffic flow after mile $N$.  A valid solution is always guaranteed
to exist.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
on 1 1
none 10 14
none 11 15
off 2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10 13
8 12

In this example, the combination of readings from segments 2 and 3 tell us that
the flow rate through these segments is somewhere in the range $[11, 14]$, since
only this range is consistent with both the readings $[10,14]$ and $[11,15]$. In
mile 1, exactly 1 unit of flow enters on an on-ramp, so prior to mile 1, the
flow rate must be in the range $[10, 13]$.  In mile 4, between 2 and 3 units
exits on an off-ramp, so the range of possible flow rates after this is
$[8,12]$.

[2025-09-03T06:19:17] thinking

**Interpreting traffic segments**

I'm tackling a problem with segments where each has sensor readings that indicate "on," "off," or "none." The readings correspond to highway traffic or ramp flo
ws. If a segment reads "none," it's just measuring the highway, while "on" indicates ramp flow entering, and "off" indicates ramp flow leaving. I need to determ
ine the tightest possible flow ranges for both the start and end of the segments based on these readings, which will help in understanding traffic patterns.
**Determining flow ranges**

I'm working on the flow equations for segments defined by sensors. The flow at each segment must satisfy specific constraints based on whether the sensor is "on
," "off," or "none."

I need to derive the valid ranges for the initial traffic, labeled \( F_0 \), and final traffic, labeled \( F_N \). It seems like I should focus on ensuring non
-negative values since traffic flow rates can't be negative, and compute the ranges carefully based on the sensors' readings to maintain consistency throughout.
 I'll also explore the backward simulation to determine the possible final ranges effectively.
**Understanding flow propagation**

I'm working through a flow propagation problem, where I need to compute the flow ranges for each segment based on sensor readings. The idea is to go backward fr
om the last segment to determine the initial range, starting with an infinite potential range.

Each segment's reading alters the range depending on whether it’s "on," "off," or "none." For "on," I subtract the ramp reading, while for "off," I add it back.
 I need to ensure non-negative flow rates by clamping ranges accordingly. Finally, I'll compute the final range using forward operations based on the initial ra
nge I established, making sure to keep everything valid and consistent.

[2025-09-03T06:19:54] thinking

**Analyzing flow constraints**

I'm considering the flow dynamics on the highway segment. We start with the initial flow, x0, and then based on the segment type, if it's 'on', the flow increas
es by ramp_flow; if 'off', it decreases; and if 'none', it remains unchanged. Each sensor provides constraints for calculating ranges for x0 and xN. For 'on', x
i adjusts upwards, for 'off' it subtracts, and 'none' stays within specified bounds. My goal is to determine all possible values for x0 and xN that satisfy thes
e conditions.
**Refining range propagation**

I'm working on establishing tight ranges for flow by propagating from the initial value, x0. Since x0 can be any real number, I need to constrain xi based on 'n
one' segments. I’ll treat x0 as an unknown range [L0, R0] and derive constraints from each segment. Each segment yields a linear inequality affecting x0. As I p
rocess each segment, I'll determine the resulting interval for x0 that meets all 'none' constraints. This involves a two-phase approach to compute the possible
range for initial flow while adjusting through the segments.
**Transforming ranges and constraints**

I'm mapping out how to transform ranges based on segment types. For 'on', I'm adjusting the new range by adding limits; for 'off', I subtract. When it's 'none',
 I need to find the intersection with the current range. I realize I can go backwards from infinite to find the initial range and propagate constraints properly
. I’ll set a current range and adjust it based on segment types as I move through them. My aim is to compute both the initial and final ranges effectively, ensu
ring all operations are valid. I’ll also use large numbers to handle infinite values.
**Structuring the solution**

I'm organizing the structure for the solution. First, I'll parse the input and define a constant for infinity. For the backward pass, I’ll set low and high vari
ables initially to negative and positive infinity, respectively, then iterate through the segments in reverse to apply the rules.

Next, I'll also do a forward pass with the same logic. Finally, I’ll print the initial and final ranges. I need to write this into a file called solution.py and
 ensure edge cases are handled, like maintaining the order of low and high values.

I'll outline the steps clearly, then proceed to code everything!

1. Problem Restatement
Determine the smallest possible ranges for the highway’s traffic rate before mile 1 and after mile N, given N one-mile segments. Each segment has either an on-r
amp, an off-ramp, or no ramp, and a sensor that reports a lower/upper bound on ramp flow (for on/off) or main-highway flow (for none).

2. Conceptual Solution
• Treat the unknown initial and final flow as intervals \[-∞,∞].
• Backward-propagate through segments (from N to 1), applying inverse operations for on/off ramps and intersecting for “none” segments. This yields the tightest
 initial flow range.
• Forward-propagate through segments (1 to N), applying direct operations and intersecting on “none” segments. This yields the tightest final flow range.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
for each segment i=1..N:
  read type[i], lo[i], hi[i]

# Backward for initial range
set (low, high) = (-INF, INF)
for i = N down to 1:
  if type[i] == "none":
    low = max(low, lo[i]); high = min(high, hi[i])
  elif type[i] == "on":
    low -= hi[i]; high -= lo[i]
  else:  # off
    low += lo[i]; high += hi[i]
(initial_low, initial_high) = (low, high)

# Forward for final range
set (low, high) = (-INF, INF)
for i = 1 to N:
  if type[i] == "none":
    low = max(low, lo[i]); high = min(high, hi[i])
  elif type[i] == "on":
    low += lo[i]; high += hi[i]
  else:  # off
    low -= hi[i]; high -= lo[i]
(final_low, final_high) = (low, high)

print initial_low, initial_high
print final_low, final_high
```
