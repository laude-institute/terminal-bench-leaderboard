[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie and Farmer John enjoy goat kart racing. The idea is very similar to
Go-Kart racing that others enjoy, except the karts are pulled by goats and the
track is made from nearby farmland. The farmland consists of $N$ meadows and $M$
roads, each connecting a pair of meadows.

Bessie wants to make a course from nearby farms.  A farm is a subset of two or
more meadows within which every meadow can reach every other meadow along a
unique sequence of roads.

The nearby farmland may contain multiple farms. Suppose there are $K$ farms.
Bessie would like to make a goat kart loop by connecting all $K$ farms by adding
$K$ roads of length $X$. Each farm should be visited exactly once and at least
one road must be traversed inside each farm.

To make the course interesting for racers, the total length of the track should
be at least $Y$. Bessie wants to know the sum, over all such interesting tracks,
of the total track lengths.  A track is different from another if there are two
meadows which are adjacent (after adding the roads between farms) in one track
but not the other. Please note that only the roads chosen matter, and not the
direction the goat karts will travel along those roads.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, $M$, $X$, and $Y$ where
$1 \leq N \leq 1500$, $1 \leq M \leq N-1$, and $0 \leq X, Y \leq 2500$.

Each of the $M$ following lines describe roads. The lines are of the form: $A_i$
$B_i$ $D_i$, meaning that meadows $A_i$ and $B_i$ are connected with a road of
integer length $D_i$ ($1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N$, $0 \leq D_i \leq 2500$).  Each
meadow is incident to at least one road, and there are no cycles of roads.

In at least 70% of the test cases, it is also guaranteed that $N \leq 1000$ and $Y \leq 1000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer, giving the sum of track lengths over all interesting
tracks. As the sum of track lengths can be quite large, print the sum of lengths
modulo
$10^9+7$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 1 12
1 2 3
2 3 4
4 5 6
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
54

This example has 6 possible tracks

1 --> 2 --> 4 --> 5 --> 1         (length 11)

1 --> 2 --> 5 --> 4 --> 1         (length 11)

2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 2         (length 12)

2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 4 --> 2         (length 12)

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 1   (length 15)

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 4 --> 1   (length 15)

The answer is $12+12+15+15=54$, adding up only the tracks where the length is at
least $12$.

Note that for this problem, the standard time limit is increased to 3 seconds
per test case (6 seconds per case for Java and Python).

**Computing distances in trees**

I'm working on calculating a sum over distances while managing edge cases. If T is less than or equal to zero, all combinations satisfy the condition, which sim
plifies things. I need to compute specific distances and track values in dynamic programming. To find distances within each tree, I’ll leverage all-pairs path d
istances, which could lead to many pairs depending on the tree sizes involved. Luckily, roots and BFS will help me keep the operations within a manageable range
. This system should work out fine for my needs.
**Analyzing BFS operations**

I'm analyzing worst-case scenarios for BFS across many components. If I have a total size of 1500, each component could cost around \(n_i^2\) in operations, whi
ch could get complicated. I’ll perform BFS for each node efficiently by computing distances only for \(v > u\) to avoid double counting. For each distance, I’ll
 track counts and sums up to a threshold T. Interestingly, I find that I don’t need certain sums based on transitions, which simplifies my calculations signific
antly while keeping the memory and operations in check for practical limits.
**Implementing tree distance calculations**

I'm diving into implementing the DP approach for handling tree distances. In a worst-case scenario with random tree edges, I might see up to 1499 distinct dista
nces. That means my dynamic programming calculations could amount to around 5 million operations, which feels manageable.

Here's my plan: First, I’ll read the input values and build an adjacency list. I will identify connected components using DFS to create a list of nodes per farm
. Then I'll run BFS for distance calculations while tracking counts and sums within constraints. This structured method should lead to a clear and efficient sol
ution.

**Problem Restatement**
We have `N` meadows connected by `M` roads forming a forest of `K` tree‐components (“farms”). We must build a single cycle that visits each farm exactly once, b
y choosing exactly two distinct nodes in each farm, linking them inside the farm along the unique path between them, and then adding one new inter‐farm road of
length `X` at each node so that all farms are joined in a big loop. A track’s total length is the sum of the internal path lengths plus `K·X`. We want the sum o
f lengths of all such cycles whose total length is at least `Y`, modulo 10^9+7. Two tracks are different if their sets of adjacent meadow‐pairs differ.

**Solution Outline**
1. Decompose the input graph into its tree components (farms).
2. For each farm, enumerate all unordered pairs of distinct nodes `(u,v)`:
   - Compute the tree distance `d(u,v)`.
   - Tally how many pairs have `d < T` and `d ≥ T`, where `T = Y – K·X`.
   - Also record the total sum of all distances in the farm (`S_i`) and the total number of pairs (`n_i`).
3. Compute:
   - `totalWays = ∏ n_i`  (total ways to pick one pair in each farm)
   - `totalDsum = totalWays · ∑ (S_i / n_i)`  (sum of all D = ∑ d_i over all combinations)
4. If `T ≤ 0`, every choice meets the length requirement.
   - Answer = `totalDsum + totalWays · (K·X)`.
5. Otherwise, run a group‐knapsack style DP over farms, tracking only partial sums `D < T`:
   - `f[s]` = number of ways to get internal‐sum `s < T`.
   - `dpSum[s]` = total of those internal‐sums.
   - `f_ge` = ways that have already reached sum ≥ T.
6. After processing all farms:
   - `f_lt = ∑_{s<T} f[s]`, `dpSum_lt = ∑_{s<T} dpSum[s]`.
   - `f_ge = totalWays – f_lt`, `dpSum_ge = totalDsum – dpSum_lt`.
   - Final answer = `dpSum_ge + f_ge · (K·X)`.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M, X, Y
build adjacency list
find all tree‐components; let K = #components
T = Y – K*X
for each component C:
    let nodes = list of vertices in C

    for each u in nodes:
        run BFS from u to get dist[u][*]
        for each v>u in nodes:
            d = dist[u][v]
            n_i += 1
            S_i += d
            if d < T: low_count[d] += 1

    for s in 0..T-1 where f[s]>0:
        fs = f[s]; ss = dpSum[s]
        for each d with count = low_count[d]:
            ways = fs * count %mod
            if s + d < T:
                new_f[s+d]     = (new_f[s+d]     + ways)%mod
                new_dpSum[s+d] = (new_dpSum[s+d] + (ss + fs*d%mod)%mod * count)%mod
            else:
                new_f_ge = (new_f_ge + ways)%mod
        // all high‐distance pairs jump to ≥T
        ways_high = fs * high_count %mod
        new_f_ge = (new_f_ge + ways_high)%mod
    // any existing ≥T stays ≥T when we multiply by any of this farm’s pairs

Explanation of key steps:
- We break the forest into `K` trees and for each tree count all node‐pair distances, splitting them into “low” (< T) and “high” (≥ T) buckets.
- We calculate the total number of ways to pick a pair in each tree (`totalWays`) and the aggregate internal‐distance sum (`totalDsum`) by a simple product‐sum
formula.
- If `T ≤ 0`, every combination already meets the minimum length, so we add the mandatory `K·X` per track.
- Otherwise we run a bounded‐sum DP up to `T−1`, tracking both the number of ways (`f[s]`) and the sum of their internal distances (`dpSum[s]`), plus an overflo
w bucket `f_ge` for sums that reach `≥T`.
- Finally, we derive the contributions of all combinations meeting the threshold by complement and add the `K·X` term.
