[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is hiding somewhere along the number line. Each of Farmer John's
$N$ other cows ($1\le N\le 1000$) have a piece of information to share: the
$i$-th cow either says that Bessie is hiding at some location less than or equal
to $p_i$, or that Bessie is hiding at some location greater than or equal to
$p_i$
($0\le p_i\le 10^9$).

Unfortunately, it is possible that no hiding location is consistent with the
answers of all of the cows, meaning that not all of the cows are telling the
truth.  Count the minimum number of cows that must be lying.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain either L or G, followed by an integer $p_i$. L
means that the $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location is less than  or
equal to $p_i$, and G means that $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location
is greater than or equal to $p_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The minimum number of cows that must be lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0

It is possible that no cow is lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

At least one of the cows must be lying.

**Conceptualizing a solution**

The user wants me to restate their problem in clear terms. They’re looking to identify a location based on cows’ statements about Bessie. The goal is to choose
a point that maximizes the number of truthful cows, minimizing liars.

Given the constraints where N can reach 1000 and p_i values can be as high as 1 billion, I’ll write pseudocode and then develop a solution in Python to achieve
this, focusing on p_i values for accuracy.
**Evaluating candidate values for x**

I’m considering candidate values for x, specifically all p_i values. For each p_i, I’ll set x equal to that p_i and evaluate the number of liars, aiming to sele
ct the minimum.

I should think about extremes like negative or positive infinity, but since p_i ranges from 0 to 1 billion, I realize that these extremes are effectively just m
in(p_i) and max(p_i). If x is very large, it may not work well for 'L' cows, while very small x can be bad for 'G' cows. I’ll also consider x at p_i, p_i - 1, a
nd p_i + 1, since the count of truthful cows only changes when x crosses a p_i.

**Problem Restatement**
Bessie is hiding at some point on the number line. Each of N cows gives a constraint: either “Bessie’s location ≤ pᵢ” (L) or “Bessie’s location ≥ pᵢ” (G). Some
cows may be lying. Find the minimum number of liars needed so that there exists a hiding spot consistent with all truthful statements.

**Solution Approach**
- Any valid hiding spot can be chosen at one of the pᵢ values.
- For each candidate x = pᵢ:
  - A cow claiming L pᵢ is lying if pᵢ < x (since x > pᵢ).
  - A cow claiming G pᵢ is lying if pᵢ > x (since x < pᵢ).
  - Count liars; track the minimum over all x.
- Runtime is O(N²) for N≤1000, which is efficient.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array of (type, p) pairs
collect unique p_values
set min_liars = N
for each x in p_values:
    liars = 0
    for each (type, p):
        if type=='L' and p < x: increment liars
        if type=='G' and p > x: increment liars
    min_liars = min(min_liars, liars)
print min_liars
```
