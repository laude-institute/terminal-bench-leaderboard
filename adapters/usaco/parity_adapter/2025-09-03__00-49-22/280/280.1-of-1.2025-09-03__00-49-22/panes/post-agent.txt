each refuse to be in the same photograph.  Given the locations of these
unfriendly pairs, please determine the minimum number of photos FJ needs to
take.

**Clarifying segment partitioning**

I’m tackling a problem with a line of N cows where N can be quite large, up to 1 billion, and we’re faced with up to 1000 unfriendly pairs. The challenge is to
cover all cows with minimal segments without including any unfriendly pairs in the same photo. I need to restate this to reflect that for each forbidden pair, m
y segments must split between the endpoints of the pair. So, for every pair, I’ll define L_i as the lower and R_i as the upper endpoint.
**Determining segment cuts**

I need to ensure that no segment covering cows includes both ends of any forbidden range [L_i, R_i]. Essentially, I want to avoid fully covering these endpoints
. A segment from x to y must avoid having both L_i and R_i within its limits. For every forbidden pair, any segment should either start after L_i or end before
R_i.

This leads to a problem of finding minimal cut positions that separate these forbidden pairs, ensuring at least one cut in each required range, which aligns wit
h interval covering strategies. My goal is to find the least number of cuts necessary to split the line appropriately.
**Verifying cuts in intervals**

I’m checking to see if the last cut at position 2 adequately splits the interval [2, 3]. Since the cut is between cow 2 and cow 3, it effectively keeps cows 2 a
nd 4 in separate segments, which is great!

When checking for other cut positions, like r = 5 and l = 5, I see that my last cut is less than 5, so I update it to 5. Now I have a total of 3 cuts, which see
ms correct.

Finally, I verify this with the interval l = 1 and r = 1, where it also works out correctly. I think I’m ready to apply my changes and add some comments in the
solution file!

1. Restatement
FJ needs to photograph cows numbered 1..N in contiguous photos such that every cow appears at least once, but certain pairs of positions (A, B) can’t be in the
same photo. We must split the line into the fewest contiguous segments so no forbidden pair lies entirely inside one segment.

2. Conceptual solution
- Each forbidden pair (A, B) defines an interval [min(A,B), max(A,B)–1] where we need at least one cut between those cows.
- Choosing cut positions is a classic interval‐hitting problem: pick the minimum number of cut points that “hit” all these intervals.
- Greedy strategy: sort intervals by their right endpoint, then sweep and place a cut at the rightmost point of each uncovered interval.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K
for each of K pairs:
    l = min(A, B)
    r = max(A, B) - 1
    add interval (l, r)
sort intervals by r ascending
last_cut = 0
cuts = 0
for each (l, r):
    if last_cut < l:
        last_cut = r
        cuts += 1
print cuts + 1
```
