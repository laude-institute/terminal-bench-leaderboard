[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In preparation for the upcoming hoofball tournament, Farmer John is drilling his
$N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1\dots N$, where $1 \leq N \leq 100$) in
passing the ball. The cows are all standing along a very long line on one side
of the barn, with cow $i$ standing $x_i$ units away from the barn
($1 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).  Each cow is standing at a distinct location.

At the beginning of the drill, Farmer John will pass several balls to different
cows. When cow $i$ receives a ball, either from Farmer John or from another cow,
she will pass the ball to the cow nearest her (and if multiple cows are the same
distance from her, she will pass the ball to the cow farthest to the left among
these).  So that all cows get at least a little bit of practice passing, Farmer
John wants to make sure that every cow will hold a ball at least once. Help him
figure out the minimum number of balls he needs to distribute initially to
ensure this can happen, assuming he hands the balls to an appropriate initial
set of cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$. The second line contains $N$
space-separated integers, where the $i$th integer is $x_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the minimum number of balls Farmer John must initially pass to the
cows, so that every cow can hold a ball at least once.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 3 11 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
2

In the above example, Farmer John should pass a ball to the cow at $x=1$ and
pass a ball to the cow at $x=11$. The cow at $x=1$ will pass her ball to the cow
at $x=3$, after which this ball will oscillate between the cow at $x=3$ and the
cow at $x=4$. The cow at $x=11$ will pass her ball to the cow at $x=7$, who will
pass the ball to the cow at $x=4$, after which this ball will also cycle between
the cow at $x=3$ and the cow at $x=4$. In this way, all cows will be passed a
ball at least once (possibly by Farmer John, possibly by another cow).

It can be seen that there is no single cow to whom Farmer John could initially pass a ball
so that every cow would eventually be passed a ball.

**Implementing directed graph logic**

I’m working on building a directed graph and need to count nodes with zero indegree since each represents an initial ball. I'll also detect pairs that mutually pass with no other incoming edges, as these pairs will require an extra ball, so I need to sum up the total. For the pseudocode, I’ll read the list, sort it, and establish passing relationships. Then, I’ll compute indegrees and finally output the total. Now, it's time to implement this in "solution.py" using Python 3 without external libraries.

Here’s the complete solution:

**Restatement**  
Given N cows at distinct positions along a line, each cow passes a ball to her nearest neighbor (breaking ties to the left). Determine the minimum number of balls Farmer John must hand out initially so that every cow eventually receives a ball at least once.

**Conceptual Solution**  
- Sort the cow positions.  
- For each cow, identify which neighbor she passes to (left if tie or closer, otherwise right).  
- Build a directed graph (`pass_to`) and count indegrees for each cow.  
- Any cow with zero indegree needs its own initial ball.  
- For each mutual passing pair (i↔j) with no other cow passing into either, add one extra ball.  
- The answer is `zero_indegree_count + mutual_pair_count`.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N and list xs
sort xs
for each i in 0..N-1:
  if i==0: pass_to[i]=1
  elif i==N-1: pass_to[i]=N-2
  else:
    if xs[i]-xs[i-1] <= xs[i+1]-xs[i]:
      pass_to[i]=i-1
    else:
      pass_to[i]=i+1

compute indegree for each target in pass_to

zero_count = count of indegree == 0
mutual_count = 0
for i in 0..N-1:
  j = pass_to[i]
  if j>i and pass_to[j]==i and indegree[i]==1 and indegree[j]==1:
    mutual_count += 1

print(zero_count + mutual_count)
```

The full implementation is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it via `python3 solution.py`.
