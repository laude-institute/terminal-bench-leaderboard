[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Balanced Cow Breeds [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John usually brands his cows with a circular mark, but his branding
iron is broken, so he instead must settle for branding each cow with a mark
in the shape of a parenthesis -- (.  He has two breeds of cows on his farm:
Holsteins and Guernseys.  He brands each of his cows with a
parenthesis-shaped mark.  Depending on which direction the cow is facing,
this might look like either a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis.

FJ's N cows are all standing in a row, each facing an arbitrary direction,
so the marks on the cows look like a string of parentheses of length N.
Looking at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please
help FJ compute the number of possible ways he could assign breeds to his N
cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: bbreeds

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of length N (1 <= N <= 1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

(())

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the number of ways FJ can
        assign breeds to cows so that the Holsteins form a balanced
        subsequence of parentheses, and likewise for the Guernseys.
        Since the answer might be a very large number, please print
        the remainder of this number when divided by 2012 (i.e., print
        the number mod 2012).  Breed assignments involving only one
        breed type are valid.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The following breed assignments work:

(())
HHHH

(())
GGGG

(())
HGGH

(())
GHHG

(())
HGHG

(())
GHGH

[2025-09-03T04:50:09] thinking

**Clarifying the problem**

I need to restate the issue: I'm looking for the number of ways to color a bracket string S of length N using two colors, H and G, ensuring that the subsequence
s of each color are balanced. It's classic dynamic programming, since N can go up to 1000. I initially thought about using a three-dimensional DP array, but tha
t seems too large. Instead, I’ll simplify by tracking the balance of each color while traversing the string to meet the balance requirements for H and G.
**Optimizing transitions**

For each character in the string, I need to manage the transitions of balances for H and G. I'll begin with the initial state and ensure that transitions only o
ccur if the new balances for H and G remain non-negative. The complexity is concerning, with a potential of more than 2 billion steps, so I need to optimize it.
 By defining a global balance and only counting the states for H, I can reduce the state count to around 500,000, which seems manageable for my DP solution.
**Finalizing the implementation plan**

It's possible that the input string can be unbalanced, but I can still compute the global balance and check for negative values. I'll use a precomputed array fo
r balances, ensuring proper transitions based on whether I assign characters to H or G. For each step, I’ll prepare my data structures, track the required balan
ces, and sequentially build my dynamic programming solution. I have a clear four-step plan, including restating, conceptualizing, pseudocoding, and implementing
 the Python solution. Now, I can get started on writing the code in `solution.py`.
**Preparing solution.py**

I’m ensuring that my `solution.py` is set up correctly and includes the necessary components like defining the main function and processing the input string. Th
e logic for calculating balances and transitions based on character assignments looks solid. After running through the code, I might consider optimizing memory
usage later, but for now, it’s ready to be implemented as is. Next, I'll update my plan and start applying the patch to finalize everything. Let’s get this done

I’ve implemented the solution in `solution.py`, which:

- Validates the original parentheses string is balanced.
- Uses a 1D DP tracking Holstein balance (Guernsey balance inferred) across assignments.
- Runs in O(N²) time and reports the count mod 2012.

Let me know if you’d like to run tests or review further!
