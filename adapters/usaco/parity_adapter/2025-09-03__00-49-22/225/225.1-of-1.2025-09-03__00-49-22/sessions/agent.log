[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Liars and Truth Tellers [Brian Dean, 2013]

After spending so much time around his cows, Farmer John has started to
understand their language.  Moreover, he notices that among his N cows 
(2 <= N <= 1000), some always tell the truth while others always lie.

FJ carefully listens to M statements (1 <= M <= 10,000) from his cows, each
of the form "x y T", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells the
truth" or "x y L", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells lies". 
Each statement involves a pair of different cows, and the same pair of cows
may appear in multiple statements.  

Unfortunately, FJ believes he might have written down some entries in his
list incorrectly, so there may not be a valid way to designate each cow as
a truth teller or a liar that is consistent with all the M statements on
FJ's list.  To help FJ salvage as much of his list as possible, please
compute the largest value of A such that there exists a valid way to
designate each cow as a truth teller or a liar in a manner that is
consistent with the first A entries in FJ's list.

PROBLEM NAME: truth

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Each line is of the form "x y L" or "x y T",
        describing a statement made by cow x about cow y.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 3
1 4 L
2 3 T
4 1 T

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 cows and 3 statements.  Cow 1 says that cow 4 lies, cow 2 says
that cow 3 tells the truth, and cow 4 says that cow 1 tells the truth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum value of A such that the first A entries in FJ's
        list can be consistent with some assignment of "truth teller"
        or "liar" to the N cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Statements 1 and 3 cannot both be satisfied at the same time, but
statements 1 and 2 can be, if we let cows 1..3 tell the truth and cow 4 be
a liar.

**Analyzing truth-tellers and liars**

I'm dealing with the "liars and truth tellers" problem, where each statement involves cows saying whether others are truth-tellers or liars. I need to figure out the largest set of statements that can be true simultaneously. This feels like a classic 2-SAT problem where I treat each cow as a boolean variable—true for a truth-teller and false for a liar. The statements have implications based on whether a cow is truthful or lying, which I need to unravel to ensure consistency.
**Solving truth relations**

In this problem, I need to determine if statements about cows being truth-tellers or liars are consistent. If two cows have the same truth value, their relation is true; if they're opposites, the relation is false. This involves managing a union-find structure with parity to maintain relationships between the cows. To find the maximum prefix of consistent statements, I can use binary search to efficiently check for validity, leveraging efficient operations to minimize computational load. This should work well within the limits.
**Implementing solution steps**

I need to approach the union-find structure properly to handle the statements about the cows. If the roots are different, I’ll union them while ensuring their relation is appropriately set by using parity. I'm also employing a binary search method to determine the maximum prefix of valid statements. I need to implement a function to check for conflicts based on the relations given. 

Once that’s done, I’ll draft clear steps and pseudocode for the user, containing all necessary components for readability, then create the solution file. Let's move forward!

**Conceptualizing Python solution**

The user needs a Python 3 solution and wants us to create a file named solution.py. I'll first rephrase the problem in straightforward terms, then think through the solution conceptually. I need to outline the pseudocode. This seems related to a "knights and knaves" scenario involving cows who can either tell the truth or lie based on given statements. I'll ensure the solution correctly interprets how statements function depending on whether a cow is a truth-teller or a liar.
**Breaking down statement implications**

For each statement involving cows, I see that they create constraints based on their truthfulness. If cow x is a truth-teller, then cow y follows a specific relation, and if cow x is a liar, y does the opposite. I need to represent each cow using a Boolean variable: true for truth-tellers and false for liars. 

This results in implications—if x says y is truthful, and x is a liar, then y must be a liar too. The complexities arise with the relations being checked for equalities and inequalities between cows, leading towards a graph-like structure that can be addressed using disjoint set union techniques with parity to check for conflicts.
**Implementing DSU logic**

I'm working on processing each statement in order, looking for the point where adding a constraint leads to a contradiction. The result, A, will be the highest index without conflicts, using a strategy to iterate over the constraints. I'll implement Union-Find with parity operations, ensuring efficiency.

For each statement, I’ll determine the relation's parity, adjusting my union operations accordingly. If there’s a conflict, I’ll return the index right before the issue. Ultimately, I’ll combine all this into a solution.py file that captures the code, while the rest of the information stays outside this file.

Here’s the breakdown and the complete implementation:

1. Restatement  
   - We have N cows, each either always tells truth or always lies. We record M statements of the form “cow x says cow y is truthful (T) or lying (L)”. We need the largest prefix of these statements that’s satisfiable by some assignment of truth/lie statuses.

2. Conceptual Solution  
   - Model each cow as a boolean variable. A “T” claim enforces equality between x and y; an “L” claim enforces inequality.  
   - Use a Union-Find (DSU) with parity tracking: each union enforces either same or opposite assignment. If a union contradicts previous constraints, we stop.

3. Pseudocode  
   ```
   read N, M
   init DSU with parity for 1..N
   for i in 1..M:
       read x, y, type
       p = 0 if type=='T' else 1
       if not dsu.union(x,y,p):
           print(i-1)
           exit
   print(M)
   ```

4. Solution saved as solution.py  
   - Implements DSU with path compression and parity tracking in Python 3  
   - Runs in O((N+M)·α(N)) time and uses no external libraries.
