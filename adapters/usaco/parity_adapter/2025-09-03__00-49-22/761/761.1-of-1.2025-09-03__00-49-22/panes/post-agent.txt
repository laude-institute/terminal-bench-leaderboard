[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John purchases three cows: Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, each of whom
initially produces 7 gallons of milk per day.  Since the milk output of a cow is
known to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements
over the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book.  Entries in his
log look like this:


35 Bessie -2
14 Mildred +3

The first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons
lower than it was when last measured.  The next entry indicates that on day 14,
Mildred's  milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured.
Farmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given
day.  Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write
down his measurements in chronological order.

To keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn
the picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several
cows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures).
Please determine the number of days on which Farmer John would have needed to
change this display.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, the number of measurements Farmer John
makes. Each of the next $N$ lines contains one measurement, in the format above,
specifying  a day (an integer in the range 1..100), the name of a cow, and the
change in her  milk output since it was last measured (a nonzero integer).  Each
cow's milk output will always be in the  range 0..1000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of days (an integer in the range 0..100) on which
Farmer John needs to adjust his motivational display.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
7 Mildred +3
4 Elsie -1
9 Mildred -1
1 Bessie +2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

Initially, all cows have milk output 7.  On day 1, Bessie's milk output
increases to 9, making her the unique cow with highest milk output and causing
Farmer John to change his display.  On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to
6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead.
On day 7, Mildred jumps into the  lead, changing the display, and on day 9,
Mildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display.

**Organizing a multi-part plan**

I’m thinking of outlining a plan for this multi-step task. It seems small enough to handle, but I still might want to capture four steps: restate, conceptualize
, write pseudocode, and implement the solution in a file. The instructions indicate that a plan is needed when it's multi-step, so I should probably go ahead wi
th it. I'll mark each step as in progress and later complete it with the final answer, ensuring it reads naturally for the user.
**Planning the solution steps**

I can structure my response as four clear steps: Step 1: Restate the problem. Step 2: Conceptualize the solution. Step 3: Write the pseudocode. Step 4: Provide
the implementation in a file named `solution.py`.

Before creating the file, I’ll include a preamble that states, “I’m creating solution.py with the final code.” After setting up the code, I’ll ensure that the f
inal answer is organized with section headers for clarity, like **Restatement**, **Solution Concept**, **Pseudocode**, and **Implementation**. That will keep ev
erything structured for the user.

**Exploring the milk production problem**

I’m considering the USACO problem "measurement." The task is to count the days when the top milk producers change. Each cow starts producing 7 gallons, and ther
e are various measurement events. I’ll use a dictionary for tracking production and a set for the current display of top producers. As I sort through the events
, I’ll update the production values and check for changes in leaders, incrementing my count when there is a shift. I wonder how to handle multiple events on the
 same day.
**Finalizing the coding approach**

The problem specifies at most one measurement per day, meaning events occur on unique days. I don’t see any edge cases here. My pseudocode outlines the process:
 parse input into a list of tuples, sort these by day, then initialize my milk dictionary and other variables. I'll update the milk production, compare the curr
ent display with the new one, and count any changes. I plan to write the code in `solution.py`, ensuring it’s all in pure Python without using outside libraries
. I’ll add the file as needed.

1. **Restated Problem**
Count how many days Farmer John’s barn display changes as he tracks three cows (Bessie, Elsie, Mildred) whose milk outputs start at 7 gallons. Each measurement
(out of N) gives a day, cow name, and change in output. He displays the cow(s) with the current highest output; ties show all top cows. Determine how many measu
rement days cause a change in which pictures are displayed.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
- Initialize each cow’s output to 7 and the displayed leader set to all three.
- Parse and sort the N measurements by day.
- For each measurement: update that cow’s output, find the new max output, build the set of cows matching that max.
- If this new leader set differs from the previous, increment the change counter and update the leader set.
- After processing all, print the total count of display changes.

3. **Pseudocode**
```
Initialize cows = {Bessie:7, Elsie:7, Mildred:7}
Read N
Read N lines of (day, name, change)
Sort measurements by day
leaders = set of all cows
changes = 0
For each (day, name, delta) in measurements:
    cows[name] += delta
    max_output = max(cows.values())
    current = {cow for cow,value in cows.items() if value == max_output}
    If current != leaders:
