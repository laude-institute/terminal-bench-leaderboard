[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem in Python is 15s.  Other languages have the default time limit of 2s.**
Each of Farmer John's $N$ barns ($2\le N\le 10^5$) has selected a team of $C$
cows ($1\le C\le 18$) to participate in field day. The breed of every cow is
either a Guernsey or a Holstein.

The difference between two teams is defined to be the number of positions $i$
($1 \leq i \leq C$) at which the breeds of the cows in the $i$th positions
differ. For every team $t$ from $1 \ldots N$, please compute the maximum
difference between team $t$ and any other team.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $C$ and $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of length $C$ of Gs and Hs.  Each line
corresponds to a team.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each team, print the maximum difference.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3
GHGGH
GHHHH
HGHHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
5
3
5

The first and third teams differ by $5$. The second and third teams differ by
$3$.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-5: $C = 10$Inputs 6-9: All answers are at least $C-3$.
 Inputs 10-20: No additional constraints.

[2025-09-03T05:48:41] thinking

**Finding efficient solutions**

I'm realizing this approach might not be efficient due to the high number of masks—262k is quite a bit. We definitely need to speed this up. I observe that the
maximum Hamming distance is limited to a small range, [0,C]. For each mask x, I'm working to find a corresponding mask y where the popcount of (x^y) equals C. I
 need to ensure y can be found in any relevant team, taking care when there are multiple occurrences and managing the indices correctly.
**Optimizing mask calculations**

I’m exploring the idea of generating all masks at specified Hamming distances from C down to 0. The combinations could sum to less than 2^C, which is beneficial
. But with C at 18, the masks might lead to around 262k combinations—too slow for N=100k. Instead, I think multi-source BFS might be the way to go, precomputing
 maximum distances for every mask. If a set contains both a mask and its complement, the maximum distance could be C for many masks. I need to carefully manage
counts and avoid trivial matches with duplicates.
**Clarifying bit manipulation logic**

I'm thinking about how to choose the order of bits. In my dynamic programming setup, I need to treat bits from 0 to C-1. When I shift left and use OR, the highe
st bit will contain the first character, which is fine! For instance, with C=5, the first character goes to bit4, and the last to bit0. I realize that for fullm
ask, the mapping works correctly. I found that I can represent masks in a straightforward way by converting strings to integers based on binary representation,
so I’ll use that moving forward.

I’ve implemented a bit-DP solution in `solution.py` that computes, for each team’s bitmask, the maximum Hamming distance to any other by transforming the proble
m into a minimal-distance DP over complements. Let me know if you’d like to run sample tests or add further optimizations!
