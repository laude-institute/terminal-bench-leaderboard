[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Party Invitations [Travis Hance, 2012]

Farmer John is throwing a party and wants to invite some of his cows to
show them how much he cares about his herd.  However, he also wants to
invite the smallest possible number of cows, remembering all too well the
disaster that resulted the last time he invited too many cows to a party.

Among FJ's cows, there are certain groups of friends that are hard to
separate.  For any such group (say, of size k), if FJ invites at least k-1
of the cows in the group to the party, then he must invite the final cow as
well, thereby including the entire group.  Groups can be of any size and
may even overlap with each-other, although no two groups contain exactly
the same set of members.  The sum of all group sizes is at most 250,000.

Given the groups among FJ's cows, please determine the minimum number of
cows FJ can invite to his party, if he decides that he must definitely
start by inviting cow #1 (his cows are conveniently numbered 1..N, with N
at most 1,000,000).

PROBLEM NAME: invite

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N (the number of cows), and G
        (the number of groups).

* Lines 2..1+G: Each line describes a group of cows.  It starts with
        an integer giving the size S of the group, followed by the S
        cows in the group (each an integer in the range 1..N).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 4
2 1 3
2 3 4

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 cows and 4 groups.  The first group contains cows 1 and 3, and
so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows FJ can invite to his party.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

In addition to cow #1, FJ must invite cow #3 (due to the first group
constraint), cow #4 (due to the second group constraint), and also cow #2
(due to the final group constraint).

**Analyzing party invitations problem**

I'm looking at the USACO problem "Party Invitations" from 2012. There are N cows and G groups, with a total size limit for invitations. Cow 1 is already invited. The interesting rule is if there are k-1 invited cows in a group, I must invite the last cow. So, if the invites reach k-1, it automatically includes the last cow, expanding the group to k. It’s all about managing those transitions effectively based on invites.
**Simulating invites efficiently**

I’m realizing that inviting more cows can trigger other groups to hit the k-1 threshold, creating a cascading effect. My goal is to keep invites to a minimum while starting with just cow 1. To manage this, I’ll simulate the process like a breadth-first search (BFS), keeping track of invited cows for each group. When the count reaches k-1, I’ll invite the last cow to maintain compliance. I'm also considering an efficient way to map cows to their respective groups to streamline tracking invites and counts, while being mindful of the size constraints.

Here’s the requested work:

1. Restatement  
- We have N cows numbered 1..N and G friend-groups.  
- Start by inviting cow 1.  
- For each group of size k, if you’ve already invited k−1 of its members, you must invite the last one too.  
- Groups may overlap.  
- Compute the minimal total number of cows invited after all forced invitations.

2. Solution Concept  
- Track which cows are invited and process them in a queue.  
- For each invited cow, update every group it belongs to.  
- When a group reaches k−1 invited members, enqueue the remaining uninvited cow.  
- Continue until no new cows are forced.

3. Pseudocode  
- Read N, G  
- For each group i: record size, members; map each member to group i  
- invited[1] = True; queue = [1]  
- While queue not empty:  
    cow = dequeue  
    For each group i containing cow:  
      groups_count[i]++  
      If groups_count[i] == size[i]−1:  
        For each member m in group i:  
          If not invited[m]: invited[m]=True; enqueue m  
- Print sum(invited)

The full implementation has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and provide input via stdin.
