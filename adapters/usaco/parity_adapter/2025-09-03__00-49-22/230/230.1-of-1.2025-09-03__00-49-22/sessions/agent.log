[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Island Travels [Neal Wu, 2007]

Farmer John has taken the cows to a vacation out on the ocean! The cows are
living on N (1 <= N <= 15) islands, which are located on an R x C grid (1
<= R, C <= 50). An island is a maximal connected group of squares on the
grid that are marked as 'X', where two 'X's are connected if they share a
side. (Thus, two 'X's sharing a corner are not necessarily connected.)

Bessie, however, is arriving late, so she is coming in with FJ by
helicopter. Thus, she can first land on any of the islands she chooses. She
wants to visit all the cows at least once, so she will travel between
islands until she has visited all N of the islands at least once.

FJ's helicopter doesn't have much fuel left, so he doesn't want to use it
until the cows decide to go home. Fortunately, some of the squares in the
grid are shallow water, which is denoted by 'S'. Bessie can swim through
these squares in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) in
order to travel between the islands. She can also travel (in the four
cardinal directions) between an island and shallow water, and vice versa.

Find the minimum distance Bessie will have to swim in order to visit all of
the islands. (The distance Bessie will have to swim is the number of
distinct times she is on a square marked 'S'.) After looking at a map of
the area, Bessie knows this will be possible.

PROBLEM NAME: island

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C.

* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 contains C characters giving row i of the
        grid. Deep water squares are marked as '.', island squares are
        marked as 'X', and shallow water squares are marked as 'S'.

INPUT DETAILS:

There are three islands with shallow water paths connecting some of them.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the minimum distance Bessie
        has to swim to visit all islands.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can travel from the island in the top left to the one in the middle,
swimming 1 unit, and then travel from the middle island to the one in the
bottom right, swimming 2 units, for a total of 3 units.

**Exploring multi-source BFS**

I'm looking into the approach for multi-source BFS to analyze islands. First, I label each island using DFS or BFS to identify connected components of 'X' and assign IDs. Then, for each island, I perform BFS from all its cells, considering movement onto 'S' and 'X' while counting costs for 'S' squares. This means using 0-1 BFS since moving onto 'X' costs 0 and 'S' costs 1, while avoiding '.' squares. Ultimately, I aim to compute the minimal cost to reach one island from another.
**Analyzing the TSP for islands**

I'm diving into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) scenario where I need to traverse all islands, starting from any one of them to sum the minimal distances. The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path, but since it doesn't need to return, I can use bitmask dynamic programming. 

I initialize the DP array and set up transitions using BFS for traversing island distances. I’ll maintain a distance grid and utilize collections.deque for efficient BFS. An important edge is handling adjacent islands, ensuring I calculate costs accurately while managing visited states.

1. Restatement  
- We have a map of R×C cells containing islands ('X'), shallow water ('S'), and deep water ('.'). Islands are connected 'X' groups by sides. We can swim on 'S' or step on 'X' but not on '.'. Starting on any island, we must visit all islands, minimizing total shallow-water steps.

2. Conceptual Solution  
- Label each island with a unique ID via DFS/BFS.  
- For each island, run a multi-source 0-1 BFS (cost 0 over 'X', cost 1 over 'S') to compute the minimum swim cost to every other island. This yields a complete graph of N nodes with edge weights.  
- Solve the minimum-cost path that visits all nodes once (no need to return) using bitmask DP: dp[mask][last] = minimal cost to cover 'mask' ending at 'last'. Initialize dp with single-node masks = 0, then iterate masks, transitions, and finally take the minimum over full-mask endings.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read R, C and grid
label islands:
  for each unvisited 'X', BFS/DFS to mark all connected 'X' as island i
  record list of cells per island
for each island i in [0..N):
  initialize dist_grid to INF, deque with all cells of island i at cost 0
  run 0-1 BFS over grid cells != '.':
    weight = 0 if 'X' else 1
    update dist_grid and deque (appendleft or append)
    when stepping on an 'X' of island j != i, record dist_matrix[i][j]
run bitmask DP over N islands:
  dp[1<<i][i] = 0
  for mask from 0..(1<<N)-1:
    for u in islands in mask:
      for v not in mask:
        dp[mask|1<<v][v] = min(dp[mask|1<<v][v], dp[mask][u] + dist_matrix[u][v])
answer = min(dp[(1<<N)-1][i] for i in [0..N))
print answer
```
