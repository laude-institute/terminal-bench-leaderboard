[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In his spare time, Farmer John has created a new video-sharing service, which he
names MooTube.  On MooTube, Farmer John's cows can record, share, and discover
many amusing videos.  His cows already have posted $N$ videos
($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$.  However, FJ can't
quite figure out how to help his cows find new videos they might like.

FJ wants to create a list of "suggested videos" for every MooTube video.  This
way, cows will be recommended the videos most relevant to the ones they already
watch.

FJ devises a metric of "relevance," which determines, as the name suggests, how
relevant two videos are to each other.  He picks $N-1$ pairs of videos and
manually computes their pairwise relevance.  Then, FJ visualizes his videos as a
network, where each video is a node and the $N-1$ pairs of videos he manually
considered are connected.  Conveniently, FJ has picked his $N-1$ pairs so that
any video can be  reached from any other video along a path of connections in
exactly one way. FJ decides that the relevance of any pair of videos should be
defined as the minimum relevance of any connection along this path.

Farmer John wants to pick a value $K$ so that next to any given MooTube video,
all other videos with relevance at least $K$ to that video will be suggested.
However, FJ is worried that too many videos will be suggested to his cows, which
could distract them from milk production!  Therefore, he wants to carefully set
an appropriate value of $K$.  Farmer John would like your help answering a
number of questions about the suggested videos for certain values of $K$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 100,000$).

The next $N-1$ lines each describe a pair of videos FJ manually compares.  Each
line includes three integers $p_i$, $q_i$, and $r_i$
($1 \leq p_i, q_i \leq N, 1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000,000$), indicating that
videos $p_i$ and $q_i$ are connected with relevance $r_i$.

The next $Q$ lines describe Farmer John's $Q$ questions.  Each line contains two
integers, $k_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq k_i \leq 1,000,000,000, 1 \leq v_i \leq N$),
indicating that FJ's $i$th question asks how many videos will be suggested to
viewers of video $v_i$ if $K = k_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output $Q$ lines.  On line $i$, output the answer to FJ's $i$th question.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1 2 3
2 3 2
2 4 4
1 2
4 1
3 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
0
2

Farmer John finds that videos one and two have relevance three, that videos two
and three have relevance two, and that videos two and four have relevance four.
Based on this, videos one and three have relevance min(3, 2) = 2, videos one and
four have relevance min(3, 4) = 3, and videos three and four have relevance
min(2, 4) = 2.

Farmer John wants to know how many videos will be suggested from video two if
$K=1$, from video one if $K=3$, and from video one if $K=4$.  We see that with
$K=1$, videos 1, 3, and 4 will be suggested on video two.  With $K=4$, no videos
will be suggested from video one.  With $K=3$, however, videos 2 and 4 will be
suggested from video one.

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing an offline DSU approach:

- Reads and sorts edges and queries by descending relevance and threshold.
- Uses union-find with path compression and union by size.
- Answers each query by counting component size minus one.

Let me know if you’d like a walkthrough or testing next!
