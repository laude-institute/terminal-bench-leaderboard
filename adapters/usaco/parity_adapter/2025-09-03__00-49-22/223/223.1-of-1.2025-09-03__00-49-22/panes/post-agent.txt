[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Mirrors [Brian Dean and Travis Hance, 2013]

Farmer John's cows have been causing too much trouble around the farm, and
FJ therefore wants to keep a more watchful eye on them.  By installing N
reflective fences (1 <= N <= 200) at various locations on the farm, he
hopes to be able to see from his house at location (0,0) to the barn at
location (a,b).

On a 2D map of FJ's farm, fence i appears as a short line segment centered
at integer location (x_i, y_i) and tilted 45 degrees (either like '/' or
like '\').  For example, a fence oriented like '/' at position (3,5) could
be described as a line segment from (2.9,4.9) to (3.1,5.1).  Each fence
(and also the location of the barn) lies at a different position with
integer coordinates in the range -1,000,000...1,000,000.  No fence lies at
(0,0) or (a,b).

FJ plans to sit at his house at position (0,0) and look directly to the
right (in the +x direction).  With his gaze bouncing off some of the
reflective fences on his farm, he hopes to be able to see the point (a,b).
Unfortunately, FJ thinks he oriented one of his fences incorrectly (e.g.,
'\' instead of '/').  Please output the index of the first fence in FJ's
list such that by toggling its direction (between '/' and '\' or vice
versa), FJ will be able to see the point (a,b).

If FJ can already see the point (a,b) without toggling any fence, please
output 0.  If it is still impossible for him to see (a,b) even after
toggling up to a single fence, output -1.

PROBLEM NAME: mirrors

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers, N, a, and b.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 describes fence i and contains either "x_i
        y_i /" or "x_i y_i \", where (x_i, y_i) is the location of the
        center of the fence, and \ or / refers to its orientation.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 6 2
3 0 /
0 2 /
1 2 /
3 2 \
1 3 \

INPUT DETAILS:

A map of the farm looks like this (with H denoting FJ's house and B
denoting the barn):
3 .\.....
2 //.\..B
1 .......
0 H../...
  0123456

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The index of the first fence for which toggling that fence
        allows FJ to see the point (a,b).  If FJ can already see the
        point (a,b), please output 0, or if there is no way he can see
        (a,b) even after toggling up to one fence, please output -1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By toggling the fence at position (3,2), FJ can see the point (a,b).  On
the map:
3 .\.....
2 //./--B
1 ...|...
0 H--/...
  0123456

**Simulating ray reflections**

I’m working on simulating a ray starting at (0,0) and moving in the +x direction, while considering N fences positioned at integer coordinates with slash orient
ations. When the ray hits a fence, it reflects as it would off a mirror, and I need to see if it can directly pass through the barn at (a,b). I’ll outline the r
ay’s possible directions: right, left, up, and down, and how they change upon hitting the different reflective surfaces.
**Simulating ray path**

I’m beginning by imagining the ray at (0,0), facing directly to the right with a starting direction of (1,0). As it moves toward the barn at (a,b), it can only
take axis-aligned paths: right, up, left, or down. My goal is to determine if the ray can go through (a,b) while avoiding obstacles represented by fences at int
eger coordinates. I need to check for fences along the ray’s path, reflecting accordingly when it hits one, and confirm if it passes through the barn’s coordina
tes at any point.
**Planning brute force simulation**

I’m considering a brute force approach to determine if a ray can pass through the barn by testing each fence. Starting without toggling any fence, if the ray ca
n see the barn, I’ll output 0. If not, I’ll toggle each fence's orientation one by one and run the simulation again, looking for the smallest index where the ra
y sees the barn. I’ll also track visited states to avoid loops. It seems efficient enough given the constraints, even with potential edge cases like the barn be
ing at (0,0).
**Considering barn location**

I realize that the barn could be at the same coordinates as a fence, but since the problem states that all fence and barn locations must be unique, this should
not happen. I need to write a solution in Python that handles the simulation of the ray’s path while taking all these details into account. I should structure t
his as requested with restatements, conceptual plans, pseudocode, and then the final code in `solution.py`. I’ll follow the guidelines carefully to ensure clari
ty and compliance.

[2025-09-03T06:21:38] codex

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing the mirror reflection simulation:

1. Ray advances from (0,0) in +x, finds nearest fence or barn on its path.
2. Reflects direction at mirrors (‘/’ or ‘\’) and checks for loops.
3. Reports 0 if already sees barn, else toggles each fence in turn to find the first that works, or -1 if none.

Let me know if you want to run tests or review the implementation!
