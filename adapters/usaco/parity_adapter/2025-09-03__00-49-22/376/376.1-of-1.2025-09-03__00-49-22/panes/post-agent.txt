[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Ski Course Design [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has N hills on his farm (1 <= N <= 1,000), each with an
integer elevation in the range 0 .. 100.  In the winter, since there is
abundant snow on these hills, FJ routinely operates a ski training camp.

Unfortunately, FJ has just found out about a new tax that will be assessed
next year on farms used as ski training camps.  Upon careful reading of the
law, however, he discovers that the official definition of a ski camp
requires the difference between the highest and lowest hill on his property
to be strictly larger than 17.  Therefore, if he shortens his tallest hills
and adds mass to increase the height of his shorter hills, FJ can avoid
paying the tax as long as the new difference between the highest and lowest
hill is at most 17.

If it costs x^2 units of money to change the height of a hill by x units,
what is the minimum amount of money FJ will need to pay?  FJ is only
willing to change the height of each hill by an integer amount.

**Formulating a Python solution**

The user wants a solution for a problem in Python 3. First, I'll restate the problem in plain English: We have N hills with different heights, and we want to ad
just them so the height difference between the tallest and shortest hill is 17 or less. The cost of adjusting each hill is the square of the adjustment amount.

Next, the conceptual solution involves a brute-force approach: using a sliding window to define height ranges and calculating the total adjustment cost for each
 range. Given the limits, I expect this will run efficiently.

1. Restatement
- We have N hills with integer elevations. We can increase or decrease each hill’s height by an integer amount at cost x² per hill. Adjust all hills so the maxi
mum and minimum elevations differ by at most 17, minimizing total cost.

2. Conceptual solution
- Since final heights must lie within some interval [low, low+17], try each low from 0 to 83.
- For each hill, if it’s below low or above low+17, compute the squared adjustment to bring it into the interval; otherwise cost is 0.
- Sum these costs per interval and take the minimum.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N and list of hills
min_cost = infinity
for low in 0..83:
    high = low+17
    cost = 0
    for h in hills:
        if h < low:
            cost += (low - h)^2
        else if h > high:
            cost += (h - high)^2
    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
print(min_cost)
```

I’ve saved the full Python implementation to `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or add anything else!
