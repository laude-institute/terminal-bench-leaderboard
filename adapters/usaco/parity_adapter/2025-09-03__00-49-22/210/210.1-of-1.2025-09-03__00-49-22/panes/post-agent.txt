[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Milk Routing [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's farm has an outdated network of M pipes (1 <= M <= 500) for
pumping milk from the barn to his milk storage tank.  He wants to remove
and update most of these over the next year, but he wants to leave exactly
one path worth of pipes intact, so that he can still pump milk from the
barn to the storage tank.

The pipe network is described by N junction points (1 <= N <= 500), each of
which can serve as the endpoint of a set of pipes.  Junction point 1 is the
barn, and junction point N is the storage tank.  Each of the M
bi-directional pipes runs between a pair of junction points, and has an
associated latency (the amount of time it takes milk to reach one end of
the pipe from the other) and capacity (the amount of milk per unit time
that can be pumped through the pipe in steady state).  Multiple pipes
can connect between the same pair of junction points.

For a path of pipes connecting from the barn to the tank, the latency
of the path is the sum of the latencies of the pipes along the path,
and the capacity of the path is the minimum of the capacities of the
pipes along the path (since this is the "bottleneck" constraining the
overall rate at which milk can be pumped through the path).  If FJ
wants to send a total of X units of milk through a path of pipes with
latency L and capacity C, the time this takes is therefore L + X/C.

Given the structure of FJ's pipe network, please help him select a single
path from the barn to the storage tank that will allow him to pump X units
of milk in a minimum amount of total time.

PROBLEM NAME: mroute

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N M X (1 <= X <= 1,000,000).

* Lines 2..1+M: Each line describes a pipe using 4 integers: I J L C.
        I and J (1 <= I,J <= N) are the junction points at both ends
        of the pipe.  L and C (1 <= L,C <= 1,000,000) give the latency
        and capacity of the pipe.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 3 15
1 2 10 3
3 2 10 2
1 3 14 1

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ wants to send 15 units of milk through his pipe network.  Pipe #1
connects junction point 1 (the barn) to junction point 2, and has a latency
of 10 and a capacity of 3.  Pipes #2 and #3 are similarly defined.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum amount of time it will take FJ to send milk
        along a single path, rounded down to the nearest integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

27

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The path 1->3 takes 14 + 15/1 = 29 units of time.  The path 1->2->3 takes
20 + 15/2 = 27.5 units of time, and is therefore optimal.

**Conceptualizing the solution**

The user wants me to restate a problem and outline a solution in pseudocode, saving it as a Python file. We have a graph with N nodes and M edges, where each ed
ge has latency L and capacity C. My goal is to compute the total latency and minimum capacity for paths from node 1 to node N, calculating the minimum time need
ed. I can achieve this by analyzing subgraphs based on capacity and finding the shortest path for each, while minimizing the overall time.
**Refining the approach**

I’m realizing that since M is limited to 500, the number of unique capacities is also manageable. I can sort these capacities in descending order. For each capa
city c, I’ll induce a graph and run Dijkstra's algorithm to get the shortest path latencies.

I’ll need to compute time based on these calculations. The complexity seems sound for the upper limits. I’ll read the edges, collect unique capacities, and crea
te an adjacency list for edges meeting the capacity requirement. After ensuring the computation for time aligns correctly, I’ll implement the solution according
ly, keeping it straightforward with 1-based indexing for nodes.
**Restating and conceptualizing the solution**

I'll create a Python script that reads a graph represented by N nodes and M edges, each with latencies and capacities. I need to filter edges based on capacity
thresholds and compute the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm to minimize total time. If no path exists at a threshold, I won’t output anything, but I wil
l assume at least one path is valid.

Following this, I’ll write the pseudocode and save it as a solution.py file by applying the necessary patch. The code will utilize an adjacency list for the gra
ph and manage strengths effectively without premature terminations.

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown and the implementation in **solution.py**:

**Problem Restatement**
- Given a network of junctions (nodes) and bi-directional pipes (edges) each with latency and capacity, find a single path from source (1) to sink (N) to send X
 units of milk.
- The path’s total time is (sum of latencies) + X / (minimum capacity along the path).
- Return the minimum total time (rounded down).

**Solution Concept**
- Observe that the “bottleneck” capacity of a path is the smallest edge capacity on it.
- For each candidate capacity threshold C (one of the edge capacities), consider the subgraph of all edges with capacity ≥ C.
- In that subgraph, compute the shortest-path latency from 1 to N via Dijkstra. If reachable, total time = latency + floor(X/C).
- Track the minimum of these times over all thresholds.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M, X
edges = []
capacities = set()
for each of M edges:
    read u, v, L, C
    edges.append((u,v,L,C))
    capacities.add(C)

sort capacities descending
best_time = ∞

for c in capacities:
    build adj list of edges with capacity >= c
    dist = Dijkstra latency from 1 to N
    if N reachable:
        time = dist[N] + floor(X/c)
        best_time = min(best_time, time)

print best_time as integer
```

The full Python implementation is in **solution.py**. Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or make optimizations!
