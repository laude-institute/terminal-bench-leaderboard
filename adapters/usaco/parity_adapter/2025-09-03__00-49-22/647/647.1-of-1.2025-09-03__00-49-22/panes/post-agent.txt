[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  does
find the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.

She is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.
The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \leq N
\leq 248$), each in the range $1 \ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessie can
take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a single
number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two adjacent 7s
with an 8).  The goal is to maximize the value of the largest number
present in the sequence at the end of the game.  Please help Bessie
score as highly as possible!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the next $N$ lines give the sequence
of $N$ numbers at the start of the game.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1
1
1
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to
obtain the sequence 1 2 2, and then she merges the 2s into a 3.  Note that it is
not optimal  to join the first two 1s.

[2025-09-03T05:38:36] thinking

**Outlining a solution approach**

The user is looking for reasoning steps rather than a coding plan. I should start by restating the problem and then conceptualize the solution using dynamic pro
gramming. The approach revolves around creating a function, `dp[l][r]`, which represents the maximum value from collapsing a segment into one number, or 0 if it
’s impossible. Although full collapse isn’t necessary, we need to find the maximum single value. In the end, the answer will be the maximum across all segments.
**Detailing the solution approach**

I’m conceptualizing a new dynamic programming strategy. It will create a table `dp[i][j]` to find the maximum value if we fully merge a subarray from `i` to `j`
. If merging isn’t possible, the value would be 0. I need to initialize the base cases and iterate through lengths of segments while calculating the maximum val
ues. When done, I’ll create a `solution.py` file with this logic as a Python implementation, and then apply the patch for the final code.
**Crafting the final message**

My final message needs to present both reasoning and the patch creation. I’ll start with a plain text explanation that includes the steps. First, I’ll state the
 problem, followed by the conceptual approach and the pseudocode. After that, I’ll indicate that I'm creating `solution.py` and then proceed with the patch. I m
ust remember to include a concise preamble before the large write to keep everything aligned with guidelines. So, my final answer includes these essential parts
 in order.

1. Problem Restatement
Bessie has a list of N positive integers. She can repeatedly merge two adjacent equal numbers into one number that’s one greater. Find the highest number she ca
n produce.

2. Solution Concept
- Use dynamic programming over intervals:
  - Let dp[i][j] be the value you can get if you fully merge the subarray from i to j into one number (or 0 if impossible).
  - Base: dp[i][i] = arr[i].
  - For longer intervals, check all split points k; if dp[i][k] == dp[k+1][j] > 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + 1.
- Track the global maximum dp[i][j] as the answer.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read array arr of length N
initialize dp[N][N] to zeros
ans = 0
for i in 0..N-1:
    dp[i][i] = arr[i]
    ans = max(ans, arr[i])
for length from 2 to N:
    for i from 0 to N-length:
        j = i + length - 1
        for k from i to j-1:
            if dp[i][k] != 0 and dp[i][k] == dp[k+1][j]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + 1)
        ans = max(ans, dp[i][j])
print ans
```
