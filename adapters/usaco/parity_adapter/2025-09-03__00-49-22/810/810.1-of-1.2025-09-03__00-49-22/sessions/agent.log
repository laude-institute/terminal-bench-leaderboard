of the trail ($0 < x_i < L$) and has a tastiness value $c_i$
($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$). If Bessie rests at stop $i$ for $t$ seconds, she
receives $c_i \cdot t$ tastiness units.

When not at a rest stop, Bessie will be hiking at a fixed travel rate of $r_B$
seconds per meter ($1 \leq r_B \leq 10^6$). Since Bessie is young and fit, $r_B$
is strictly less than $r_F$.

Bessie would like to maximize her consumption of tasty grass. But she is worried
about Farmer John; she thinks that if at any point along the hike she is behind
Farmer John on the trail, he might lose all motivation to continue!

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his personal trainer Bessie are hiking up Mount Vancowver. For
their purposes (and yours), the mountain can be represented as a long straight
trail of length $L$ meters ($1 \leq L \leq 10^6$). Farmer John will hike the
trail at a constant travel rate of $r_F$ seconds per meter
($1 \leq r_F \leq 10^6$). Since he is working on his stamina, he will not take
any rest stops along the way.

Bessie, however, is allowed to take rest stops, where she might find some tasty
grass. Of course, she cannot stop just anywhere! There are $N$ rest stops along
the trail ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$); the $i$-th stop is $x_i$ meters from the start
of the trail ($0 < x_i < L$) and has a tastiness value $c_i$
($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$). If Bessie rests at stop $i$ for $t$ seconds, she
receives $c_i \cdot t$ tastiness units.

When not at a rest stop, Bessie will be hiking at a fixed travel rate of $r_B$
seconds per meter ($1 \leq r_B \leq 10^6$). Since Bessie is young and fit, $r_B$
is strictly less than $r_F$.

Bessie would like to maximize her consumption of tasty grass. But she is worried
about Farmer John; she thinks that if at any point along the hike she is behind
Farmer John on the trail, he might lose all motivation to continue!

Help Bessie find the maximum total tastiness units she can obtain while making
sure that Farmer John completes the hike.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains four integers: $L$, $N$, $r_F$, and $r_B$. The

$i+1$-st line contains two integers $x_i$ and $c_i$, describing the position of
the $i$-th rest stop and the tastiness of the grass there.

It is guaranteed that $r_F > r_B$, and $0 < x_1 < \dots < x_N < L $.  Note
that $r_F$ and $r_B$ are given in seconds per meter!

A single integer: the maximum total tastiness units Bessie can obtain.

In this example, it is optimal for Bessie to stop for $7$ seconds at the $x=7$ rest stop (acquiring $14$ tastiness units) and then stop for an additional $1$ second at the $x=8$ rest stop (acquiring $1$ more tastiness unit, for a total of $15$ tastiness units).

**Planning a greedy solution**

I'm working on the USACO problem called "Rest Stops." This involves a classic greedy approach where Bessie only benefits from the best rest stops until she gets to a better one. I’ll calculate the time differences based on segment lengths and the rates of FJ and Bessie. The strategy involves scanning from the start and picking the tastiest stops, using a stack to track peaks for efficiency. Since inputs are sorted, I can achieve this with a linear scan, ensuring it fits within constraints. I'll read necessary inputs next.
**Designing the solution steps**

I'm building a list of the best rest stops by iterating and tracking the maximum tastiness. When I find a tastiness that's higher than what I've recorded, I’ll note its position and value. At the end of this process, I'll reverse the list. Then, I’ll compute the total time Bessie can wait at each stop and how much tastiness she gains from that waiting. The calculations will involve multiplicative operations; however, Python can handle these large numbers, so I'm set. 

Now I need to write the problem step-by-step in plain English and then draft the code in `solution.py`. So, let's do that! First, I’ll restate the problem clearly, and then outline the conceptual solution and pseudocode to follow.
**Outlining the conceptual approach**

The concept revolves around Bessie stopping only at the tastiest rest stops before a more delicious one. I plan to scan through the stops and select the ones with maximum tastiness as we progress. After that, I'll divide the trail into segments based on these chosen stops. For each segment, the time difference will be calculated by multiplying the difference in their speeds with the distance. 

Next, I'll write pseudocode based on this plan, then implement everything in `solution.py`, ensuring it reads from the standard input and writes to standard output. Let's get started on that!

**1. Problem Restatement**  
We have a straight trail of length L. Farmer John walks at speed 1/r_F meters per second (i.e. r_F seconds per meter) and never stops. Bessie walks faster (r_B < r_F), but can stop at N designated rest stops (each at position x_i with tastiness c_i) to graze. If she waits t seconds at stop i, she gains c_i·t tastiness. To keep John motivated, Bessie must never finish the hike before him (i.e. she can only wait at stops for up to the extra time John takes to cover the same ground). Compute the maximum total tastiness Bessie can collect.

**2. Solution Concept**  
- Bessie gains waiting‐time equal to (r_F–r_B)·distance for each segment she covers.  
- She should only wait at stops that have the highest tastiness value seen so far when looking ahead, because any weaker stop before a stronger one is suboptimal to wait at.  
- Scan the rest stops from the end backward, pick those with strictly increasing tastiness. Reverse that list to get them in trail order.  
- Starting from position 0, for each selected stop:
  - Compute segment length = stop_x – last_x  
  - Available wait time = (r_F–r_B)·segment length  
  - Tastiness gained = available wait time·stop_c  
  - Accumulate and update last_x  

**3. Pseudocode**  
```
read L, N, rF, rB
read arrays x[1..N], c[1..N]

best_stops = empty list
max_c = 0
for i from N down to 1:
    if c[i] > max_c:
        append (x[i], c[i]) to best_stops
        max_c = c[i]
reverse best_stops

last_x = 0
total = 0
for (pos, taste) in best_stops:
    dist = pos - last_x
    wait_time = (rF - rB) * dist
    total += wait_time * taste
    last_x = pos

print total
```

**4. solution.py**  
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    L, N, rF, rB = map(int, data[:4])
    rest = []
    idx = 4
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[idx]); c = int(data[idx+1])
        rest.append((x, c))
        idx += 2

    # Select only the stops with decreasing tastiness from the end
    best = []
    max_c = 0
    for x, c in reversed(rest):
        if c > max_c:
            best.append((x, c))
            max_c = c
    best.reverse()

    last_pos = 0
    total = 0
    dt = rF - rB
    for x, c in best:
        dist = x - last_pos
        total += dist * dt * c
        last_pos = x

    print(total)
