[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's a hot summer day out on the farm, and Farmer John is serving lemonade to
his $N$ cows! All $N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$) like lemonade,
but some of them like it more than others. In particular, cow $i$ is willing to
wait in a line behind at most $w_i$ cows to get her lemonade. Right now all $N$
cows are in the fields, but as soon as Farmer John rings his cowbell, the cows
will immediately descend upon FJ's lemonade stand. They will all arrive before
he starts serving lemonade, but no two cows will arrive at the same time.
Furthermore, when cow $i$ arrives, she will join the line if and only if there
are at most $w_i$ cows already in line.

Farmer John wants to prepare some amount of lemonade in advance, but he does not
want to be wasteful. The number of cows who join the line might depend on the
order in which they arrive. Help him find the minimum possible number of cows
who join the line.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains $N$, and the second line contains the $N$
space-separated integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_N$.  It is guaranteed that
$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$, and that $0 \leq w_i \leq 10^9$ for each cow $i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the minimum possible number of cows who might join the line, among all
possible orders in which the cows might arrive.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 400 2 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this setting, only three cows might end up in line (and this is the smallest
possible).  Suppose the cows with $w = 7$ and $w = 400$ arrive first and wait in
line.  Then the cow with $w = 1$ arrives and turns away, since 2 cows are already
in line.  The cows with $w = 2$ then arrive, one staying and one turning away.

**Maximizing cow rejections**

I’m considering how to minimize the number of cows that join the line based on their thresholds. Each cow has a threshold, w_i, and will only join if the line l
ength is less than or equal to w_i when they arrive. To get the least joiners, it seems logical to have cows with larger thresholds arrive first, filling the li
ne. That way, when the cows with lower thresholds arrive, the line is too long for them to join, maximizing rejections.
**Determining join conditions**

I’m working through how to maximize the number of cows that can be forced to join by considering their thresholds. To minimize joiners, I could sort their thres
holds in ascending order. If a cow's threshold w_i is greater than the current number of joined cows, I can reject her. So, I need to let high-threshold cows jo
in first until we reach a certain number k. After that, low-threshold cows will arrive and get rejected if their thresholds are below k, maximizing our targeted
 joiners.
**Minimizing cow joiners**

I’m figuring out how to minimize the total number of cows that join the line. Once we have k joiners, any cow with a threshold w equal to or greater than k will
 join, but we want to reject those cows instead. To do this, I need to ensure that after the initial joiners, all arriving cows have w values less than k. The k
ey is identifying a subset of cows that can join, specifically those with thresholds w greater than or equal to some threshold, and finding the smallest k that
satisfies the requirements.
**Preparing a solution**

I'm analyzing how to determine the minimum number of cows that join a line based on their thresholds. If k=0, and cows with thresholds w=2 attempt to join, I ca
n see that getting three joiners is the minimum. This greedy approach identifies the highest thresholds first, but my goal is to minimize joiners, which seems t
o still work effectively. I plan to write a solution in Python, detailing the problem, creating pseudocode, and implementing the solution. I'll get started on t
hat!

**Analyzing join strategies**

I'm thinking about minimizing joins by managing the order in which entities arrive based on their weights. If an entity has a large weight, they should arrive w
hen the line is big enough to prevent waiting. However, if the weight is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, they will join regardless. The goal is to
 allow small weights to arrive when the line is longer so they can't join, while maximizing the line size with larger weights first. This strategy ultimately se
eks to achieve minimal joins.
**Evaluating join order for minimization**

I'm rethinking how to minimize the number of joiners by choosing an effective arrival order. If we let the smallest weight arrive first, they might join when th
e line is empty. To prevent this, they should arrive later to see a larger line, so they skip joining.

However, I realize that if I sort the weights in ascending order, it tends to result in the maximum number of joiners. Interestingly, sorting in descending orde
r yields the minimal joiners, as shown in the examples. It seems I need to refine the order to achieve my goal of fewer joins.

1. Restated Problem
- There are N cows each with a tolerance w_i: they will join the lemonade line only if its current length is ≤ w_i. All cows arrive in some order (distinct time
s), and we want the arrival order that yields the fewest joiners.

2. Solution Concept
- To minimize joiners, let the most tolerant cows arrive first so the line grows early. Then lower-tolerance cows will see an already-long line and turn away. S
orting tolerances descending and greedily counting cows whose w_i ≥ current_line achieves this minimum.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list W of size N
sort W descending
count = 0
for each w in W:
    if w >= count:
        count += 1
print count
```

4. solution.py
- Created in the workspace with the above logic. You can run it via:
  ```bash
  python3 solution.py < input.txt
