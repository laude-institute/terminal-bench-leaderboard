[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Bessie is using the latest and greatest innovation in text-editing software,
miV! She starts with an input string consisting solely of upper and lowercase
English letters and wishes to transform it into some output string. With just
one keystroke, miV allows her to replace all occurrences of one English letter
$c_1$ in the string with another English letter $c_2$. For example, given the
string $\texttt{aAbBa}$, if Bessie selects $c_1$ as 'a' and $c_2$ as 'B', the given string transforms into
$\texttt{BAbBB}$.

Bessie is a busy cow, so for each of $T$ ($1\le T\le 10$) independent test
cases, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to transform her input
string into her desired output string.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $T$, the number of independent test cases.

The following $T$ pairs of lines contain an input and output string of equal
length.  All characters are upper or lowercase English letters (either A through
Z or a through z). The sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to change
the input string into the output string, or $-1$ if it is impossible to do so.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
abc
abc
BBC
ABC
abc
bbc
ABCD
BACD
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0
-1
1
3

The first input string is the same as its output string, so no keystrokes are
required.

The second input string cannot be changed into its output string because Bessie
cannot change one '$\texttt{B}$' to '$\texttt{A}$' while keeping the other as
'$\texttt{B}$'.

The third input string can be changed into its output string by changing
'$\texttt{a}$' to '$\texttt{b}$'.

The last input string can be changed into its output string like so:
$\texttt{ABCD} \rightarrow \texttt{EBCD} \rightarrow \texttt{EACD} \rightarrow \texttt{BACD}$.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-6: Every string has a length at most $50$.Inputs 7-9: All strings consist only of lowercase letters '$\texttt{a}$'
through '$\texttt{e}$'Inputs 10-15: No additional constraints.

[2025-09-03T06:18:26] thinking

**Planning a Python solution**

The user wants a Python 3 solution that includes restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, creating pseudocode, and saving it all as a `.py` file wit
hout using external libraries.

The problem can be described as needing to transform an initial string into a target string by replacing characters. Each transformation counts as one keystroke
, and we're tasked with minimizing these keystrokes, reporting -1 if the transformation isn't feasible.

I’ll map characters ensuring global replacements. Let's work through this together!
**Building character transformations**

I see that the task involves creating transformations between characters using a graph structure where letters are nodes, and operations like c1 → c2 create dir
ected edges. For each letter in the initial string, we need to ensure it can correctly map to the target letter without consistency violations. If inconsistency
 arises, like when one character maps to multiple targets, it’s impossible to transform correctly.

I’ll need to simulate these transformations and create a directed graph to track the necessary operations effectively!
**Detecting cycles in transformations**

To process the character transformations, I need to find strongly connected components (SCC) in the graph. For nodes of size one without self-loops, I’ll check
if they connect to others without forming a cycle. I can use Depth-First Search (DFS) for cycle detection.

While traversing, I’ll mark visited nodes and track the current path to record cycles without recounting them. Each cycle's edges influence the total operations
. The goal is to determine the required operations while being cautious of free letters if cycles exist. If cycles are present but I have no free letters, then
transformation becomes impossible.
**Implementing the solution**

I'm testing different sample cases to validate the transformation logic. I have some mappings that show how characters transform. For instance, in the case of "
ABCD" to "BACD", it creates a cycle with operations totaling 3, which matches perfectly.

I need to restate the problem, conceptualize the approach, write pseudocode, and finally implement it as `solution.py`. I'll ensure I count cycles accurately an
d check for free letters if cycles are present. I'll structure the final output with distinct sections for clarity!

**Restatement**
- Given two equal-length strings of English letters (`s` → `t`), you can globally replace every occurrence of one letter `c₁` with another `c₂` in one operation
.
- Determine the minimum operations to turn `s` into `t`, or report `-1` if impossible.

**Solution Approach**
- For each character `c` in `s`, its target must be consistent across all positions; otherwise impossible.
- Build a mapping graph where each `c → mapping[c]` (excluding self-maps).
- This functional graph has edges count = number of needed replacements.
- In acyclic parts, each edge is one operation.
- Each cycle of length `k` needs `k + 1` operations (use an unused “temporary” letter to break the cycle).
- If there is any cycle but no free letter available (from the 52 English letters), it’s impossible.

**Pseudocode**
```
function min_keystrokes(s, t):
    mapping = {}
    for each position i:
        if s[i] != t[i]:
            if mapping[s[i]] inconsistent with t[i]: return -1
            else mapping[s[i]] = t[i]
    used_letters = set(s) ∪ set(t)
    free_letters = all_letters − used_letters
    total_edges = size(mapping)
    visited = empty_set
    cycles = 0
    for each node in mapping:
        if node not in visited:
            walk along mapping, tracking path indices:
                if next not in mapping or already fully visited: break
                if next in current path: cycles += 1; break
                continue walking
    if cycles > 0 and free_letters is empty: return -1
    return total_edges + cycles
```

**Implementation**
The complete solution is saved in `solution.py`.
- Reads from stdin: number of cases, then each source/target pair.
- Prints one answer per line.
