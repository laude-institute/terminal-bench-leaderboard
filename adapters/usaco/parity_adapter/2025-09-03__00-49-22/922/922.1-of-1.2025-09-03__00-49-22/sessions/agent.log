[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie and Elsie are helping Farmer John wash the dishes, a more complicated
process than one might think due to their lack of opposable thumbs.

The two cows decide that Bessie will apply soap, and Elsie will rinse. Bessie is
given a dirty stack of plates labeled $1$ through $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$)
Elsie has an empty stack, where clean plates will go. There is a counter in
between Bessie and Elsie for soapy stacks.

At each step, either:

Bessie takes a plate from the top of the dirty stack, applies soap, and then
places it on the counter. When placing a soapy plate on the counter, Bessie must
either (i) place the plate on top of an existing non-empty soapy stack or (ii)
create a new soapy stack to the right of all existing soapy stacks.

Elsie takes a plate from the top of the leftmost soapy stack. Elsie rinses the
plate, then places it on top of the clean stack.

The goal is for the clean stack to have all plates in order, with the smallest
label on the bottom and the largest label on the top.  It may not be possible
for the cows to achieve this goal for the entire stack of plates, so please
determine the length of the largest prefix of the input ordering for which the
goal is achievable.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines specify the order of
the dishes in Bessie's stack, with the first number being the dish on top of the
stack.

**Analyzing plate stacking problem**

I need to work through the problem involving Bessie applying soap to plates in a specific order and stacking them. She can create multiple soapy stacks, always placing a newly soaped plate on top or starting a new stack. The key here is that Elsie wants to rinse them in increasing order, from 1 to k. I need to figure out how many plates can be cleaned in this way while ensuring they are in the correct order. Let's find the maximum k possible.
**Simulating soapy stacks**

I'm thinking about how Bessie handles the plates with soap: when she soaks a plate, she can stack it on an existing soapy stack or create a new one. This feels a lot like simulating patience sorting stacks. She must ensure that the soapy stacks maintain a specific order to enable rinsing in increasing sequence. Taking from the leftmost stack is crucial. I need to simulate this for each prefix and keep track of the top values in the stacks as we process them**Simulating plate rinsing process**

I'm working through the problem with Bessie placing plates. When adding a new plate x, if there's a stack with a top plate greater than x, I should place x on that stack. If not, I create a new stack. After each placement, I check if the leftmost stack's top matches the current rinse number, starting from 1. I need to find the maximum K where this rinsing process can clean the plates in order. If the rinsed count differs from the prefix length after processing, then it indicates a problem. I should track this as I simulate the operations for each plate.
**Designing plate stack management**

I need to outline how to manage plates as they are placed into stacks. When receiving a plate x, if there's no stack with a top plate greater than or equal to x, I create a new stack. If y (the next plate) is greater than x, I make another new stack. If y is less than or equal to x, I find the appropriate stack for it. This requires maintaining a non-decreasing order among stack tops. I’ll implement the rinsing process after each placement, checking if the leftmost stack's top matches the current rinse target. For managing the stacks efficiently, I’m considering using deques for quick access. Finally, I’ll keep track of the rinsed plates and calculate the maximum prefix K that can be rinsed in order.
**Reassessing plate rinsing strategy**

I’m thinking about how to track the maximum number of processed and contiguous rinsed plates. Upon the first failure to rinse, I'll realize that the rinse_target minus one will be less than the processed count, which becomes my answer. While future operations could help, if the first K plates can’t be rinsed fully, then adding more plates won’t help — it only creates more soapy plates. The actual challenge is to rinse in the right order, achieving a sorted outcome. 

I need to explore how Bessie can effectively manage placements to allow Elsie opportunities for rinsing, ensuring the apples are in a clear sequence from smallest to largest in the clean stack. I’ll have to simulate various scenarios to find workable combinations.

**Planning Python solution**

The user wants to create a Python solution following four steps: first, I'll restate the problem in simple terms. Next, conceptualizing the solution involves figuring out the algorithm to simulate stack operations. I’ll write pseudocode outlining the logic. Finally, I'll implement the actual solution in a file named solution.py, ensuring it involves no external libraries. This problem resembles patience sorting, where stacks represent piles that must be arranged in ascending order through specific push and pop operations.
**Clarifying stack operations**

Bessie must place plates on top of existing non-empty stacks or create a new one to the right. There don't seem to be restrictions on which stack to use, but to help Elsie retrieve the smallest needed plate, we should ensure the leftmost stack has the smallest accessible top plate. Elsie always takes from the leftmost stack, so we can't have larger plates blocking smaller ones. This resembles a longest increasing subsequence problem. For a prefix length L, we can determine if the predicted output is possible by simulating a greedy process. Bessie should push each plate onto the rightmost possible stack that maintains increasing order.
**Simulating stack operations**

In this scenario, Bessie pushes plates while Elsie pops them when possible. We need to determine if it's feasible to continue pushing until the next needed plate is reachable at the top of the leftmost stack. If at any point both actions become impossible, it indicates misordering among stacks. To maximize accessibility, I want to keep stack tops in increasing order from left to right. The goal is to simulate the process for each prefix, checking if output 1 through k can be maintained in sorted order. If it's not achievable, longer prefixes won't be possible either, suggesting a binary search approach to find the maximum feasible prefix length.
**Maintaining sorting constraints**

To manage the plates efficiently, I recognize that Elsie can only pop the next_needed plate when it matches the minimum element that hasn't been output. This leads to maintaining a multiset of prefix elements while identifying the next smallest available. I'll use a min-heap for these operations, and while popping, I must ensure that the plates are rinsed in the correct order to maintain a sorted clean stack. The process involves pushing plates to stacks and popping them following the constraints Elsie dictates. I'll simulate this to identify the largest feasible prefix, adjusting my approach to ensure the clean stack remains in sorted order.
**Preparing to implement solution**

I'm working on the logic for managing the stacks and keeping track of their tops. When popping from a stack that becomes empty, I need to update my front pointer and the tops list accordingly. This ensures I'm always referencing the correct "top" of each stack. I also plan to implement binary search for efficiency while checking if a prefix is feasible.

After that, I’ll create a Python file named `solution.py`, including the problem restatement, conceptual solution, pseudocode, and the code. I’ll ensure all my logic is properly laid out before proceeding to apply the code patch for the file.

**Outlining the solution steps**

The user wants me to restate the problem, conceptualize a solution, write pseudocode, and save it as solution.py, using Python 3 without any outside libraries. 

We’re working with a dirty stack where Bessie soaps the plates, sorting them into soapy stacks, while Elsie rinses from the leftmost stack. The goal is to determine how many plates can be washed to form a clean stack sorted from 1 to k, with 1 at the bottom. I'll focus on maximizing the prefix length for this process.
**Understanding the plate sorting problem**

I see that we need to find the largest k such that we can take the first k plates and wash them in order, producing a sorted sequence from 1 to k. 

Bessie's choice of how to organize soapy stacks matters because the stacks can mimic sequences. Placing plates on these stacks resembles a longest increasing subsequence approach, which links to minimizing the number of stacks in patience sorting. 

Elsie always takes from the leftmost stack, so we need to simulate this behavior efficiently. To maximize the length of k, I'll explore how Bessie can use a greedy simulation based on patience sorting principles. We need to check if we can successfully create the sequence from 1 to k given our conditions.
**Deciphering the sorting simulation**

The goal is to find the longest prefix such that we can sort the plates from 1 to k without forming any 3-2-1 patterns or increasing sequences. For a prefix of length k, I need to interleave Bessie's and Elsie's operations. I can simulate this by using stacks: I’ll maintain a list of soapy stacks, checking each plate against the next needed plate.

Bessie should place each plate on the leftmost stack with a top that is greater than or equal to its value, ensuring smaller top plates remain accessible for Elsie. By doing so, I'll determine the largest k for which the process succeeds in producing the output from 1 to k. I'll run through some sample scenarios to see where the sorting might fail.
**Clarifying the rinsing process**

The challenge is to determine the largest prefix of plates that can be arranged so that the clean stack ends up sorted in increasing order from smallest at the bottom to largest on top. 

Initially, it seems there's confusion over whether all plates from 1 to k need to be present. However, only the labels from the prefix matter. The key is that as long as the rinse operation results in a sorted output, it can still fulfill the requirements. 

I’ll use the example of prefix length 4 with plates {4, 5, 2, 3}. This can create a sorted clean stack with labels 2, 3, 4, 5 when rinsed correctly, confirming that the goal is achievable. I’ll keep refining my simulation to ensure I can track the rinsing sequence effectively.
**Understanding rinsing sequence**

I realize that while I can rinse a prefix of length 4, I can't process all 5 plates because 1 is deeper and missing from the first four. It seems I misunderstood the next_needed concept—it should start at the minimum label among the prefix rather than always at 1. 

For the prefix {4, 5, 2, 3}, the clean stack only needs to be sorted at the end. It doesn't require that I rinse all labels. The goal is to interleave rinsing and soaping at every step, allowing me to achieve the sorted outcome by managing which plates to rinse effectively as they become available. The key is understanding that rinsing can happen anytime a plate matches the next_needed label, even if some labels are missing.

Here’s the write-up and the implementation saved as `solution.py`.

1. Restatement  
   - You have a stack of N uniquely labeled dirty plates (labels 1…N). Bessie soaks plates onto one of several “soapy” stacks (she can push onto an existing stack or start a new one on the right). Elsie then rinses plates by popping from the leftmost non-empty soapy stack, building up a clean stack. They want the final clean stack to have its plates sorted (smallest on bottom, largest on top). Compute the largest prefix of the initial stack (top-down) for which this is achievable.

2. Conceptual solution  
   - When soaping plate x, you assign it to the first soapy stack whose current top is > x (to keep each stack’s contents strictly decreasing and keep stack-tops in increasing order); if none, start a new stack on the right.  
   - You can “rinsе” (pop) from the leftmost stack whenever its top is the smallest among all soapy-stack tops and also smaller than any future (still-to-soap) plate—this guarantees that pops form a strictly increasing sequence.  
   - We only need to test prefixes: for a given length k, we know all future values in that prefix and can precompute suffix minima to know when it’s safe to rinse. If, after processing all k plates and rinsing whenever safe, no soapy stacks remain, the prefix is feasible.  
   - Finally, binary-search the largest k for which this test passes in O(N log N) time.

3. Pseudocode

```
read N and array A[0…N-1]

# build suffix_min[i] = min(A[i], A[i+1], …)
suffix_min[N] = +∞
for i = N-1 down to 0:
    suffix_min[i] = min(A[i], suffix_min[i+1])

# can we process prefix length k?
function feasible(k):
    tops = empty list        # each entry is index of top plate in a soapy stack
    below = array[-1] * k    # linked list pointer for each plate’s stack
    start = 0                # first non-empty stack in tops
    last_rinsed = -∞

    for i in 0…k-1:
        x = A[i]
        # find first stack j in [start…len(tops)) with A[tops[j]] > x
        j = binary_search_first(tops, start, x, key = A[index] > x)
        if j exists:
            below[i] = tops[j]
            tops[j] = i
        else:
            append i to tops

        # rinse whenever the leftmost top is strictly between last_rinsed and suffix_min[i+1]
        while start < len(tops):
            idx = tops[start]
            v = A[idx]
            fut = (i+1<k) ? suffix_min[i+1] : +∞
            if last_rinsed < v < fut:
                last_rinsed = v
                tops[start] = below[idx]
                if tops[start] == -1:
                    start += 1
            else:
                break

    return (start == len(tops))  # all soapy stacks drained?

# binary search max k with feasible(k)=true
low = 0; high = N+1
while high - low > 1:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if feasible(mid):
        low = mid
    else:
        high = mid

print low
```

4. Implementation  
The above logic is fully implemented in `solution.py` in the current directory. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
