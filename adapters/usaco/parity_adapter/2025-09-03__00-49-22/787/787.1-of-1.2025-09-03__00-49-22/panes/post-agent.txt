[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John realizes that the income he receives from milk production is
insufficient to fund the growth of his farm, so to earn some extra money, he
launches a cow-rental service, which he calls "USACOW" (pronounced "Use-a-cow").

Farmer John has $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), each capable of producing
some amount of milk every day.  The $M$ stores near FJ's farm
($1 \leq M \leq 100,000$) each offer to buy a certain amount of milk at a
certain price.  Moreover, Farmer John's $R$ ($1 \leq R \leq 100,000$)
neighboring farmers are each interested in renting a cow at a certain price.

Farmer John has to choose whether each cow should be milked or rented to a
nearby farmer.  Help him find the maximum amount of money he can make per day.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line in the input contains $N$, $M$, and $R$. The next $N$ lines each
contain an integer $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 1,000,000$),  indicating that Farmer
John's $i$th cow can produce $c_i$ gallons of milk every day. The next $M$ lines
each contain two integers $q_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \leq q_i, p_i \leq 1,000,000$),
indicating that the $i$th store is willing to buy up to $q_i$ gallons of milk
for $p_i$ cents per gallon.  Keep in mind that Farmer John can sell any amount
of milk between zero and $q_i$ gallons to a given store. The next $R$ lines each
contain an integer $r_i$ ($1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000$), indicating that one of
Farmer John's neighbors wants to rent a cow for $r_i$ cents per day.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of one line containing the maximum profit Farmer John
can make per day by milking or renting out each of his cows.  Note that the
output might be too large to fit into a standard 32-bit integer, so you may need
to use a larger integer type like a "long long" in C/C++.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
6
2
4
7
1
10 25
2 10
15 15
250
80
100
40
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
725

Farmer John should milk cows #1 and #4, to produce 13 gallons of milk.  He
should completely fill the order for 10 gallons, earning 250 cents, and sell the
remaining three gallons at 15 cents each, for a total of 295 cents of milk
profits.

Then, he should rent out the other three cows for 250, 80, and 100 cents, to
earn 430 more cents.  (He should leave the request for a 40-cent rental
unfilled.)  This is a total of 725 cents of daily profit.

[2025-09-03T05:41:23] thinking

**Implementing Rental Service Problem**

I'm working on the classic USACO "Rental Service" problem. The cows with their milk production need to be managed against the stores' needs for milk quantities,
 while maximizing profit from renting or milking. I’ll sort cows by production in descending order for milking, and ascending for renting. Then, I’ll compute th
e cumulative incomes and profits while maximizing through strategic choices of which cows to milk and which to rent based on their production levels.
**Maximizing Total Profit**

I'm calculating the total profit for the rental service problem using the formula that combines milk profits and rental incomes. First, I need to handle edge ca
ses, ensuring k does not exceed the number of cows or renters. I'll read the number of cows, renters, and stores, then sort the cows by production. After calcul
ating cumulative profits and revenues, I'll prepare to find the maximum profit. It's also crucial to respect the strategy of renting the smallest producers whil
e milking the largest. Finally, I’ll package everything neatly in a script.
**Finalizing Solution Steps**

I'm ready to restate the problem, summarize the conceptual solution, and provide pseudocode before writing solution.py. Since I’m not using external libraries,
I’ll ensure to use efficient input methods for performance. After summarizing everything clearly in plain English, I'll create the file as instructed and update
 accordingly. To make sure the user knows what to expect, I’ll start with a statement about creating solution.py, then I'll proceed with the updates. Let’s get
that finalized!

Restated the problem, outlined an approach, provided pseudocode, and implemented the solution in `solution.py`. The program:

- Sorts cows by production and computes prefix milk sums.
- Sorts store offers by price with prefix quantities/revenues.
- Uses binary search to calculate milk revenue for any production total.
- Sorts rental offers and computes prefix rental sums.
- Iterates possible numbers of rentals (0 to min(N,R)), combining milk revenue from the top producers with rental income from the lowest producers.
- Outputs the maximum profit.

Let me know if you’d like test runs or further verification!
