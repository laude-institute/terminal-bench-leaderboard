[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean, 2011]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 100) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 10,000), each with an associated length. 
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
FJ's morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

**Analyzing shortest path increases**

I'm thinking through finding the maximum increase in the shortest path from node 1 to N by doubling the weight of one edge and recomputing. First, I should calculate the original shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. However, I realize that doubling any edge, not just those on the original path, might affect the shortest path. I’ll double each edge's weight, recalculate the new shortest path, and track the maximum difference from the original calculation. Finally, I'll restore the weight for each edge.
**Evaluating time complexity**

I'm calculating time complexity here and it looks like M multiplied by Dijkstra's is leading to a huge number—around 700 million operations, which feels borderline excessive for Python. But since N is small, I wonder if it's more efficient to only focus on edges that are part of the shortest path. Mainly, if I double an edge not on the original path, it may not increase the length. So it seems I should only consider edges on the original shortest path for the maximum increase in distance.
**Refining edge selection for Dijkstra**

I’ve settled on the idea that only edges on the original shortest path (SP) matter when considering doublings. If I double an edge not part of that path, it shouldn’t change the path’s distance. I need to find the original path P, then for each edge in P, I’ll double its length and run Dijkstra to figure out the new shortest path length, recording the difference each time. This seems efficient since it only takes at most 100 runs of Dijkstra, fitting well within Python's capabilities. I’ll make sure to handle edge cases, especially with multiple paths. 

Now, I need to clearly restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, write pseudocode, and save everything in a file named solution.py. This will ensure we cover all bases while implementing the necessary functions.
**Finalizing edge modification process**

I'm thinking through the implications of doubling edges on the shortest paths. If an edge isn’t on the chosen path, it won’t cause an increase. However, if multiple shortest paths overlap, I could still consider them while focusing primarily on my computed path. 

I’ll use an adjacency list format to keep track of edges, storing their weights efficiently. After implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path and reconstructing the edges used, I can double those weights, rerun the algorithm, and check for increases. 

Now, I'll write this into code in a new file.

1. Problem restatement  
FJ walks on a weighted undirected graph from node 1 to node N along the shortest path. Cows pick one edge and double its weight. We need the maximum possible increase in the shortest‐path length.

2. Solution outline  
- Compute original shortest path (using Dijkstra), tracking predecessor edges.  
- Reconstruct the unique path from 1→N.  
- For each edge on this path:  
  - Double its weight.  
  - Recompute Dijkstra shortest‐path length.  
  - Track the increase over the original.  
  - Restore the weight.  
- Output the maximum increase.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read n, m
build adjacency list, edge list, weights list
(dist, prev_edge) = dijkstra(1)
orig = dist[n]
path_edges = reconstruct edges from prev_edge back to 1
max_inc = 0
for each e in path_edges:
    save old_w = weights[e]
    weights[e] = old_w * 2
    (d2, _) = dijkstra(1)
    max_inc = max(max_inc, d2[n] - orig)
    weights[e] = old_w
print max_inc
```
