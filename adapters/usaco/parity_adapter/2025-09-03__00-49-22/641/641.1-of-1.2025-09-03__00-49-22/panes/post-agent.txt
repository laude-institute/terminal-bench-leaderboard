[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($3 \leq N \leq 50,000$) are all located at distinct
positions in his two-dimensional field.  FJ wants to enclose all of the cows
with a rectangular fence whose sides are parallel to the x and y axes, and he
wants this fence to be as small as possible so that it contains every cow (cows
on the boundary are allowed).

FJ is unfortunately on a tight budget due to low milk production last quarter.
He would therefore like to build an even smaller fenced enclosure if possible,
and he is willing to sell one cow from his herd to make this possible.

Please help FJ compute the smallest possible area he can enclose with his fence
after removing one cow from his herd (and thereafter building the tightest
enclosing fence for the remaining $N-1$ cows).

For this problem, please treat cows as points and the fence as a collection of
four line segments (i.e., don't think of the cows as "unit squares").  Note that
the answer can be zero, for example if all remaining cows end up standing  in a
common vertical or horizontal line.  Finally, note that since $N$ can be quite
large, you may need to be careful in how you solve this problem to make sure
your program runs quickly enough!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines each contain two
integers specifying the location of a cow.  Cow locations are positive integers
in the range $1 \ldots 40,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write a single integer specifying the minimum area FJ can enclose with his fence
after removing one carefully-chosen cow from his herd.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
2 4
1 1
5 2
17 25
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

**Analyzing rectangle area problem**

I'm exploring the challenge of finding the minimal enclosing rectangle for a set of cow coordinates while excluding one cow at a time. The naive approach involv
es recalculating the area repeatedly, which would take too long due to the number of coordinates. Instead, I need a smarter method by precomputing sorted lists.
 I can track the minimum and maximum coordinates carefully; if I remove a cow that uniquely affects these values, I can use the second minimum and maximum value
s instead. That should speed up my calculations!
**Defining boundaries for area calculation**

To find the area excluding one cow, I’ll calculate the boundaries for each cow. The left and right boundaries depend on whether the cow has the minimum or maxim
um x-coordinate. I need to precompute the first and second smallest and largest x and y coordinates, paying attention to duplicate values since multiple cows ca
n share the same coordinates.

I'll use sorted arrays of these coordinates to determine the boundaries efficiently. This means for each cow, I can quickly find the necessary coordinates and t
hen compute the minimal area. If there are two cows at the same minimum, I can keep the min the same unless I remove the only cow at that point. If N is 3 or mo
re, I can implement this in O(N) time!
**Coding the area calculation**

Alright, I'm about to code up the area calculation. For each cow, I'll compute the boundaries—left, right, bottom, and top—based on the sorted coordinates. Then
, I'll calculate the area and keep track of the minimum area found. The process involves sorting the lists first, which takes O(N log N) time, and then looping
through the cows, which is O(N).

This should all work smoothly under the constraints. I'll make sure to use integer arithmetic for accuracy and avoid libraries since I want to keep it simple. L
et's implement this in `solution.py`!

**Clarifying solution requirements**

I created solution.py, but I’m thinking we might need to add execute permissions. In Python, that’s often not necessary for just saving. However, I see a potent
ial issue: we didn’t explicitly restate the problem or provide a separate pseudocode as the instructions suggested. The user likely expects both an explanation
and the code. I realize we might have missed detailing our reasoning before just saving the file. I want to ensure the user has everything they need!
**Preparing final message**

I need to make sure the final message includes a restatement of the problem, a conceptual solution, pseudocode, and a note about the solution file. After applyi
ng the patch, I should clearly outline those four bullet points in the message. I also need to specify that no libraries were used. I want to ensure everything
is clear and includes all necessary details for the user to easily understand the solution. Let's get this organized!

Here’s the breakdown and the implementation in **solution.py**.

**1. Problem Restatement**
We have N distinct points (cows) on a 2D plane. We want an axis-aligned rectangle of minimum area that contains all but one cow. Removing the optimal single cow
 may shrink one of the rectangle’s edges.

**2. Conceptual Solution**
- If you know the smallest and largest x and y among all cows, you can compute the bounding rectangle.
- Removing one cow only affects an edge if that cow was the unique extremal (min or max) in x or y.
- Precompute the first and second smallest/largest x and y (with their cow indices).
- For each cow, pick the appropriate min/max x and y (using the second-extremal if you’re removing the extremal cow) and compute the area.
- Track the minimum area over all choices.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N
read cows[0..N-1] as (x,y)
xs = sort list of (x,i)
ys = sort list of (y,i)

x_min1, i_min1 = xs[0]
x_min2, _      = xs[1]
x_max1, i_max1 = xs[-1]
x_max2, _      = xs[-2]

y_min1, j_min1 = ys[0]
y_min2, _      = ys[1]
y_max1, j_max1 = ys[-1]
y_max2, _      = ys[-2]

min_area = ∞
for i in 0..N-1:
    left   = x_min1 if i≠i_min1 else x_min2
    right  = x_max1 if i≠i_max1 else x_max2
    bottom = y_min1 if i≠j_min1 else y_min2
    top    = y_max1 if i≠j_max1 else y_max2
    area = (right-left) * (top-bottom)
    min_area = min(min_area, area)

print(min_area)
```

**4. Implementation**
The code below is saved in **solution.py** (no external libraries used):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Compute the minimum area of an axis-aligned rectangle enclosing N-1 cows
after removing exactly one cow.
"""

import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    cows = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Sort by x and by y, tracking original indices
    xs = sorted((cows[i][0], i) for i in range(N))
    ys = sorted((cows[i][1], i) for i in range(N))

    # Extract first/second min and max values
    x_min1, i_min1 = xs[0]
    x_min2, _      = xs[1]
    x_max1, i_max1 = xs[-1]
    x_max2, _      = xs[-2]

    y_min1, j_min1 = ys[0]
    y_min2, _      = ys[1]
    y_max1, j_max1 = ys[-1]
    y_max2, _      = ys[-2]

    min_area = None
    for i in range(N):
        left   = x_min1 if i != i_min1 else x_min2
        right  = x_max1 if i != i_max1 else x_max2
        bottom = y_min1 if i != j_min1 else y_min2
        top    = y_max1 if i != j_max1 else y_max2

        area = (right - left) * (top - bottom)
        if min_area is None or area < min_area:
            min_area = area

    print(min_area)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

You can run it with:
```
