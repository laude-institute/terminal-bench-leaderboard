[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Landscaping [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a
large amount of dirt in the process.

The garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 <= N <= 100), where
flowerbed i initially contains A_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like
to re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B_i
units of dirt.  The A_i's and B_i's are all integers in the range 0..10.

To landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase
one unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for $X.  He can
remove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped
away for $Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to
flowerbed j at a cost of $Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total
cost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.

**Defining the landscape problem**

The user needs help with a landscape problem related to minimizing costs involving dirt adjustments. It’s framed as a min-cost flow or dynamic programming challenge. I need to translate the problem into simple terms, conceptualize the solution, and then draft pseudocode before saving it as solution.py. The setup likely involves nodes representing flowerbeds with supply and demand, and I might consider a DP approach since the amounts are manageable. There’s a possibility of incorporating multi-commodity aspects too.
**Clarifying the flow network setup**

I'm working on designing a flow network that includes sources and sinks. There'll be a super source connected to surplus nodes, where the capacity is the excess amount and costs zero. If there's a deficit, the capacity to the sink is defined by that deficit at zero cost. For any dirt movement between nodes, I'll set infinite capacity and a cost based on the distance. 

Edges are set up for both adding and removing dirt: a removal edge will have a cost, and each flowerbed node will have its supply accurately modeled to reflect initial available units, generating as needed.
**Refining the flow model**

I’m trying to establish a flow model without using supply constraints. Instead, I need to simulate flows, sending exactly A_i units from each node. While a typical min-cost flow might focus on supply and demand, I think a min-cost max flow could work better, with each node having defined supply and demand values. 

I’ll create a super source and super sink, and design edges to implement purchases and removals. This way, we can efficiently balance flows and ensure surplus units are moved where they’re needed while tracking costs for purchasing and removing dirt.
**Modeling the supply-demand network**

I’m trying to refine the network to better match supply with demand. If there's an excess supply, we need to remove it, so I’ll create edges from supply nodes to the sink with the removal cost. The goal is to minimize the total cost of movements, purchases, and removals. 

Instead of overcomplicating, I’ll define the minimum-cost max flow by constructing nodes for supply, demand, and costs related to purchases and removals, keeping the model simple. Using direct connections and ensuring all initial supplies are used effectively will clarify the flow without unnecessary complexity.
**Formulating the flow network**

I'm analyzing a removal cost scenario where it seems units are removed selectively depending on supply and demand. The goal is to ensure that the total units removed align with the quantities needed, while managing movement costs and purchase options effectively. 

I want to build a flow network where edges represent supplies and purchases at specific costs while ensuring the capacities are properly set for each node. This includes calculating the min-cost max flow efficiently with the right setup. I'll summarize the steps to implement this in a clear manner as I prepare to write the solution.

**1. Problem Restatement**

We have N beds in a row, each with some initial dirt \(A_i\) and a desired amount \(B_i\). We can

- **Buy** one unit of dirt at any bed for cost \(X\).
- **Remove** one unit of dirt from any bed for cost \(Y\).
- **Move** one unit from bed \(i\) to bed \(j\) at cost \(Z \times |i - j|\).

We want to transform all beds from \(\{A_i\}\) to \(\{B_i\}\) at minimum total cost.

---

**2. Solution Concept**

Model this as a **minimum-cost max-flow** on a small network:

- Create a super-source \(S\) and super-sink \(T\).
- **Supply nodes** \(1\dots N\) represent “dirt providers” (initial dirt).  
  - Edge \(S \to j\) with capacity \(A_j\), cost 0 (use existing dirt).  
  - Edge \(j \to T\) with capacity \(A_j\), cost \(Y\) (remove dirt).
- **Demand nodes** \(N+1 \dots 2N\) represent “dirt consumers” (desired dirt).  
  - Edge \(S \to N+i\) with capacity \(B_i\), cost \(X\) (buy dirt).  
  - Edge \(N+i \to T\) with capacity \(B_i\), cost 0 (satisfy demand).
- **Movement edges** from every supplier \(j\) to every consumer \(i\)  
  - Edge \(j \to N+i\) with “infinite” capacity and cost \(Z \times |i-j|\).

We then push exactly \(\sum A_j + \sum B_i\) units from \(S\) to \(T\).  That flow splits into:

- \(A_j\) units from each supplier will either go to consumers (move) or back to \(T\) (remove).
- \(B_i\) units to each consumer come from suppliers (move) or from \(S\) (buy).

The total flow is fixed and finite, and the min-cost max-flow solution gives the least cost.

---

**3. Pseudocode**

```
read N, X, Y, Z
read arrays A[1..N], B[1..N]

totalA = sum(A)
totalB = sum(B)
V = 2*N + 2
S = 0
T = V-1

build empty graph with V nodes

function add_edge(u, v, cap, cost):
    add forward edge (u->v) with (cap, cost)
    add backward edge (v->u) with (0, -cost)

for j in 1..N:
    add_edge(S, j,     A[j], 0)   # use existing dirt
    add_edge(j, T,     A[j], Y)   # remove dirt

for i in 1..N:
    di = N + i
    add_edge(S, di,    B[i], X)   # buy dirt
    add_edge(di, T,    B[i], 0)   # satisfy demand

INF = totalA + totalB
for j in 1..N:
  for i in 1..N:
    di = N + i
    dist = abs(i - j)
    add_edge(j, di, INF, Z*dist)

flow, cost = min_cost_flow(S, T, totalA + totalB)
print(cost)
```

Here `min_cost_flow(s, t, F)` runs a standard successive-shortest-path (with potentials) to send exactly `F` units of flow, returning the total cost.

**Notes**

- We index supplier nodes as `1…N` and consumer nodes as `N+1…2N`.
- We push exactly `sum(A) + sum(B)` units to ensure all initial dirt is either moved or removed, and all demand is either satisfied by old dirt or by new purchases.
- The total cost of the flow is the minimum landscaping cost.
