Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nProblem 3: Landscaping [Brian Dean, 2012]\n\nFarmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a\nlarge amount of dirt in the process.\n\nThe garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 <= N <= 100), where\nflowerbed i initially contains A_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like\nto re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B_i\nunits of dirt.  The A_i\'"\'"\'s and B_i\'"\'"\'s are all integers in the range 0..10.\n\nTo landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase\none unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for $X.  He can\nremove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped\naway for $Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to\nflowerbed j at a cost of $Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total\ncost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: landscape\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Space-separated integers N, X, Y, and Z (0 <= X, Y, Z <=\n        1000).\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated integers A_i and\n        B_i.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n4 100 200 1\n1 4\n2 3\n3 2\n4 0\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 4 flowerbeds in a row, initially with 1, 2, 3, and 4 units of\ndirt. Farmer John wishes to transform them so they have 4, 3, 2, and 0\nunits of dirt, respectively.  The costs for adding, removing, and\ntransporting dirt are 100, 200, and 1.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum cost for Farmer John\'"\'"\'s\n        landscaping project.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n210\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nOne unit of dirt must be removed (from flowerbed #4), at a cost of 200.  The\nremaining dirt can be moved at a cost of 10 (3 units from flowerbed #4 to\nflowerbed #1, 1 unit from flowerbed #3 to flowerbed #2).\n\n[END PROBLEM]\'', 'Enter']
