[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Lineup [Brian Dean and Daniel Dara, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are lined up in a row.  Each cow is
identified by an integer "breed ID" in the range 0...1,000,000,000; the
breed ID of the ith cow in the lineup is B(i).  Multiple cows can share the
same breed ID.

FJ thinks that his line of cows will look much more impressive if there is
a large contiguous block of cows that all have the same breed ID.  In order
to create such a block, FJ chooses up to K breed IDs and removes from his
lineup all the cows having those IDs.  Please help FJ figure out
the length of the largest consecutive block of cows with the same breed ID
that he can create by doing this.

PROBLEM NAME: lineup

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the breed ID B(i).

SAMPLE INPUT:

9 1
2
7
3
7
7
3
7
5
7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 9 cows in the lineup, with breed IDs 2, 7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7, 5, 7.
FJ would like to remove up to 1 breed ID from this lineup.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The largest size of a contiguous block of cows with
        identical breed IDs that FJ can create.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By removing all cows with breed ID 3, the lineup reduces to 2, 7, 7, 7, 7,
5, 7.  In this new lineup, there is a contiguous block of 4 cows with the
same breed ID (7).

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-09-03T04:51:42] thinking

**Analyzing contiguous blocks**

I'm thinking about how the removal of breed IDs affects the longest contiguous same-ID block. When we remove breed IDs, all occurrences disappear, which impacts
 the sequence. To find the largest block of an identical breed ID, I need to consider where that breed appears in the original list. As I remove other breeds, t
he remaining blocks could come from non-adjacent occurrences. The goal is to choose K other breeds to remove, maximizing the contiguous block for breed b after
everything compresses.
**Finding maximum breed blocks**

I'm trying to figure out how to identify the maximum number of breed b's within a specific interval where the other breeds have a size of K or less. The goal is
 to ensure that the interval's endpoints are at positions of breed b. After removal, only breed b’s remain in contiguous blocks, but the presence of other breed
s can break these blocks.

To achieve the longest contiguous block of breed b, I need to find a subarray in the original positions, ensuring that we only have breeds we’re willing to remo
ve within that interval. This leads me to consider using a two-level sliding window to efficiently compute the longest sequence across all occurrences of breed
b while keeping track of other non-b breeds.
**Finding the largest breed segment**

I’m considering how to identify the longest contiguous block of breed b after removing up to K non-b breeds. This involves ensuring that all gaps between breed
b instances contain a maximum of K distinct breeds. Instead of a brute-force approach (which is too expensive), I could implement a sliding window method for ea
ch breed b. This will track positions and handle distinct breeds efficiently, allowing me to maximize the count of breed b without getting overwhelmed by the ga
ps. Each gap needs careful assessment to ensure it meets the K constraint.
**Handling frequency checks**

I’m thinking about how to manage my frequency dictionary and heap when the frequency of an ID reaches zero. If I see a zero frequency, the heap might not be up-
to-date. While checking the top, if the frequency matches zero, I need to handle that correctly. It's okay for the current maximum to be zero, especially if the
 window is empty. I might consider keeping the ID in the frequency dictionary even if it reaches zero, as this helps track the distinct count. I'll proceed to i
mplement that with the patch.

I’ve implemented a sliding-window solution that maintains at most K+1 distinct breeds in the current window and uses a max-heap to track the most frequent breed
 count. The script reads from stdin and prints the optimal contiguous block length after removing up to K breeds. Let me know if you’d like any tests or further
 tweaks!
