[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has gone out for a walk down the road and thinks he may now be lost!

Along the road there are $N$ farms ($1 \leq N \leq 100$) in a row.  Farms unfortunately
do not have house numbers, making it hard for Farmer John to figure out his location
along the road.  However, each farm does have a colorful mailbox along the side of the
road, so Farmer John hopes that if he looks at the colors of the mailboxes
nearest to him, he can uniquely determine where he is.

Each mailbox color is specified by a letter in the range A..Z, so the sequence of $N$
mailboxes down the road can be represented by a string of length $N$ containing
letters in the range A..Z.  Some mailboxes may have the same colors as other mailboxes.
Farmer John wants to know what is the smallest value of $K$ such that if he looks at
any sequence of $K$ consecutive mailboxes, he can uniquely determine the location
of that sequence along the road.

For example, suppose the sequence of mailboxes along the road is 'ABCDABC'.  Farmer
John cannot set $K=3$, since if he sees 'ABC', there are two possible locations along
the road where this consecutive set of colors might be.  The smallest value of $K$
that works is $K=4$, since if he looks at any consecutive set of 4 mailboxes,
this sequence of colors uniquely determines his position along the road.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the second line contains a string of $N$ characters, each in the range A..Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a line containing a single integer, specifying the smallest value of $K$ that
solves Farmer John's problem.

SAMPLE INPUT:
7
ABCDABC
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

**Planning solution generation**

I’m considering a straightforward approach to solving this problem by iterating from 1 to N. For each K, I’ll track substrings using a set. If a duplicate is fo
und, I’ll break out; otherwise, if no duplicates exist, K will be the answer. I’ll write the necessary pseudocode and then follow that up by creating a Python s
cript named solution.py. It seems like a clear path without needing any complicated updates. I’m ready to produce the parts needed!
**Structuring solution steps**

I’ve organized my plan for the solution into clear sections. First, I'll restate the problem, then move on to the conceptual solution and its pseudocode. The us
er explicitly requested saving the solution as solution.py, so I'll create that file. Even though comments weren't specifically required, I think having them fo
r clarity could be beneficial.

I'll prepare the final output to include each of these parts, followed by a patch command for applying the changes. I need to ensure I format the patch correctl
y for the commentary channel.
**Finalizing solution presentation**

I’ve got a clear understanding of how to structure my solution based on the instructions. First, I’ll restate the problem, followed by the conceptual solution a
nd pseudocode. After narrating these sections for clarity, I’ll call for the apply_patch to save the solution as solution.py. It’s important to present everythi
ng in a logical sequence before applying the patch. I’m ready to put this all together for the user!

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restated the problem: Determine the smallest window size `K` so every substring of length `K` in the mailbox-color string is unique.
2. Conceptual approach: Iterate `K` from 1 to `N`, collect all substrings of length `K` into a set, and check for duplicates. The first `K` without duplicates i
s the answer.
3. Pseudocode:
   - Read `N` and string `S`.
   - For `K` = 1 to `N`:
     - Initialize an empty set `seen`.
     - For each starting index `i` from 0 to `N-K`:
       - Extract substring `sub = S[i:i+K]`.
       - If `sub` in `seen`, break (not unique).
       - Else add `sub` to `seen`.
     - If no duplicates found, print `K` and exit.
4. The solution is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and provide the input via stdin.
