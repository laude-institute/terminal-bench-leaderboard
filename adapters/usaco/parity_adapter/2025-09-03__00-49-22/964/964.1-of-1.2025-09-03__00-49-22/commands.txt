Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nFarmer John has gone out for a walk down the road and thinks he may now be lost!\n\nAlong the road there are $N$ farms ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100$) in a row.  Farms unfortunately \ndo not have house numbers, making it hard for Farmer John to figure out his location\nalong the road.  However, each farm does have a colorful mailbox along the side of the\nroad, so Farmer John hopes that if he looks at the colors of the mailboxes\nnearest to him, he can uniquely determine where he is.\n\nEach mailbox color is specified by a letter in the range A..Z, so the sequence of $N$\nmailboxes down the road can be represented by a string of length $N$ containing \nletters in the range A..Z.  Some mailboxes may have the same colors as other mailboxes.\nFarmer John wants to know what is the smallest value of $K$ such that if he looks at\nany sequence of $K$ consecutive mailboxes, he can uniquely determine the location\nof that sequence along the road.\n\nFor example, suppose the sequence of mailboxes along the road is \'"\'"\'ABCDABC\'"\'"\'.  Farmer \nJohn cannot set $K=3$, since if he sees \'"\'"\'ABC\'"\'"\', there are two possible locations along\nthe road where this consecutive set of colors might be.  The smallest value of $K$\nthat works is $K=4$, since if he looks at any consecutive set of 4 mailboxes,\nthis sequence of colors uniquely determines his position along the road.\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe first line of input contains $N$, and the second line contains a string of $N$ characters, each in the range A..Z.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nPrint a line containing a single integer, specifying the smallest value of $K$ that\nsolves Farmer John\'"\'"\'s problem.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n7\nABCDABC\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n4\n\nProblem credits: Brian Dean\n\n[END PROBLEM]\'', 'Enter']
