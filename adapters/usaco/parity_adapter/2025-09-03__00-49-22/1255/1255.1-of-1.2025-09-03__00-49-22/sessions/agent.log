[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his archnemesis Farmer Nhoj are playing a game in a circular
barn. There are $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) rooms in the barn, and the $i$th room
initially contains  $a_i$ cows ($1 \leq a_i \leq 5\cdot 10^6$). The game is
played as follows:

Both farmers will always be in the same room. After entering a room, each
farmer takes exactly one turn, with Farmer John going first. Both farmers
initially enter room $1$.If there are zero cows in the current room, then the farmer to go loses.
Otherwise, the farmer to go chooses an integer $P$, where $P$ must either be $1$
or a prime number at most the number of cows in the current room, and removes
$P$ cows from the current room.After both farmers have taken turns, both farmers move to the next room  in
the circular barn. That is, if the farmers are in room $i$, then they move to
room $i+1$, unless they are in room $N$, in which case they move to room
$1$.
Determine the farmer that wins the game if both farmers play optimally.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input contains $T$ test cases. The first line contains  $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 1000$).  Each of the $T$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing $N$, followed by a line containing
$a_1,\dots,a_N$. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $N$ is at most
$2\cdot 10^5$.

**Formulating Python solution**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution to a combinatorial game problem. I need to break it down into understandable parts: restating the problem in plain English, conceptualizing it, writing pseudocode, and finally saving the implementation as solution.py. 

The game involves N rooms in a circle, with each having an initial number of cows. The two players alternate turns starting from room 1, removing cows based on specific rules. If a player encounters a room with no cows on their turn, they lose. Each room gets played once in a cycle until someone loses.
**Analyzing game mechanics**

The game's outcome relies on the parity of total cycles and the win-lose status for each room. Each room allows two moves — John's followed by Nhoj's — and cows are reduced accordingly. As cows persist across cycles, the gameplay becomes more complex, especially when considering multiple cycles. 

With the circular nature of the barn, players will revisit rooms with remaining cows. Nhoj sees it as a normal play game on a cyclic graph, and the challenge is determining the winner with optimal play. The strategy may involve computing a Grundy-like nim value for each room. 

For single heaps, John wins if he starts in a winning position based on the size of the heaps. However, when multiple heaps are in play, the cycle twist complicates matters, as the sequence of moves impacts win conditions significantly.
**Exploring game outcomes**

I'm analyzing how to compute the win/lose status for the game based on varying sizes of heaps and the players' moves. For instance, with a size of 4, John loses because all of his moves lead to Nhoj's winning positions.

The complexity increases with more heaps in a circular format. Losing in any room ends the game, and players take turns sequentially. The strategy involves classifying heaps based on immediate winning conditions for John and Nhoj, determining their futures with dynamic cow counts, and finding optimal moves. Ultimately, identifying the patterns in winning and losing positions helps clarify the gameplay.
**Summarizing the solution**

The main conclusion is that the game's outcome depends on whether a1 is divisible by 4: if it is, Nhoj wins; if not, John wins. This logic simplifies the problem to just the first room. If John starts in a losing position, he can't win before reaching room two. 

To implement this, I'll walk through the required steps: restate the problem, provide a conceptual solution, write pseudocode, and then save the final solution as solution.py. The implementation reads input for multiple test cases and checks the condition for a1, printing the winner based on that. 

Now, I will input the necessary content for solution.py as a patch.

1. Restated Problem  
We have a circle of \(N\) rooms each containing \(a_i\) cows. Farmer John (FJ) and Farmer Nhoj alternate removing cows (1 or a prime number) starting in room 1: FJ first, then Nhoj. If a player’s turn arrives and the current room has 0 cows, that player loses immediately. After both move in a room, they advance to the next room (wrapping around). We must determine which farmer wins under optimal play.

2. Solution Concept  
For a single heap (room) with subtraction moves \(\{1\}\cup\{\text{primes}\}\), it’s a classic subtraction game whose losing positions are exactly multiples of 4. Since the game always starts in room 1, FJ either wins or loses there before ever moving on:
- If \(a_1 \bmod 4\neq 0\), room 1 is a winning heap for the first player ⇒ FJ wins.
- If \(a_1 \bmod 4 = 0\), room 1 is a losing heap ⇒ FJ loses immediately ⇒ Nhoj wins.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read T
for each test case:
    read N
    read list a[1..N]
    if a[1] mod 4 == 0:
        print "Farmer Nhoj"
    else:
        print "Farmer John"
```

4. solution.py  
The file `solution.py` implements the above in Python 3 without external libraries.
