[BEGIN PROBLEM]
When bored of playing their usual shell game, Bessie the cow and her friend
Elsie like to play another common game called "guess the animal".

Initially, Bessie thinks of some animal (most of the time, this animal is a cow,
making the game rather boring, but occasionally Bessie is  creative and thinks
of something else).  Then Elsie proceeds to ask a series of questions to figure
out what animal Bessie has selected.  Each question asks whether the animal has
some specific characteristic, and Bessie answers each question with "yes" or
"no". For example:


Elsie: "Does the animal fly?"
Bessie: "No"
Elsie: "Does the animal eat grass?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal make milk?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal go moo?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "In that case I think the animal is a cow."
Bessie: "Correct!"

If we call the "feasible set" the set of all animals with characteristics
consistent with Elsie's questions so far, then Elsie keeps asking questions
until the feasible set contains only one animal, after which she announces this
animal as her answer.  In each question, Elsie picks a characteristic of some
animal in the feasible set to ask about (even if this characteristic might not
help her narrow down the feasible set any further).  She never asks about the
same  characteristic twice.

Given all of the animals that Bessie and Elsie know as well as their
characteristics, please determine the maximum number of "yes" answers  Elsie
could possibly receive before she knows the right animal.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains the number of animals, $N$
($2 \leq N \leq 100$).   Each of the next $N$ lines describes an animal.  The
line starts with the animal name,  then an integer $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 100$),
then $K$ characteristics of that animal. Animal names and characteristics are
strings of up to 20 lowercase characters (a..z).  No two animals have  exactly
the same characteristics.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the maximum number of "yes" answers Elsie could receive before the
game ends.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
bird 2 flies eatsworms
cow 4 eatsgrass isawesome makesmilk goesmoo
sheep 1 eatsgrass
goat 2 makesmilk eatsgrass
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, it is possible for Elsie to generate a transcript with  3 "yes"
answers (the one above), and it is not possible to generate a transcript with
more than 3 "yes" answers.

[2025-09-03T04:51:19] thinking

**Analyzing animal characteristics**

I need to analyze N animals and their characteristics to figure out the maximum number of "yes" answers before identifying a specific animal. The key is to choo
se two animals with the most overlapping traits, allowing for the most shared "yes" answers. After exhausting those overlaps, I'd need at least one additional q
uestion about a unique characteristic to differentiate them. The question is whether the game ends before or after this distinguishing question when the feasibl
e set size is reduced to one.
**Maximizing yes answers**

Elsie's strategy involves asking questions until only one animal remains, aiming for the maximum number of "yes" responses. She'll prioritize characteristics sh
ared by the target animal and others to gather as many "yes" answers as possible. Once she exhausts common traits, she can ask about a unique characteristic tha
t only the target has to confirm it. The maximum number of yes answers is determined by the largest overlapping set of shared characteristics between the target
 animal and another. This involves finding the best animal comparison to maximize shared traits and getting as many yes responses as possible.
**Developing solution for animal characteristics**

I'm computing the maximum number of "yes" answers until one animal remains. By examining pairs of animals for shared characteristics, I can calculate their over
laps effectively. The strategy is to ensure that I account for unique characteristics that could prune the options, but I’m ensured at least one difference exis
ts among animals. With a plan to restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, write pseudocode, and implement it, I'll create a Python file that reads input
s and prints the result. Keeping the process structured will help me stay on track!

1. **Problem Restatement**
   - We have N animals, each described by a unique name and a set of characteristics.
   - Elsie asks yes/no questions about characteristics to identify Bessie’s chosen animal.
   - She can keep asking until only one animal in the “feasible set” remains.
   - We want the maximum number of “yes” answers Elsie could receive before the game ends.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - In the worst case, Bessie’s chosen animal and another animal share as many characteristics as possible, allowing that many “yes” answers on shared traits.
   - After exhausting shared traits, one more “yes” on a trait unique to the chosen animal distinguishes it.
   - Therefore, for every pair of animals, compute the size of the intersection of their characteristic sets. The answer is the maximum intersection size plus o
ne.

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   Read integer N
   For each of N lines:
       Read name, K, then K characteristics
       Store the characteristics as a set
   max_common = 0
   For each pair of sets (i, j):
       common = size of intersection of set_i and set_j
       if common > max_common:
           max_common = common
   print(max_common + 1)
   ```

4. **Implementation**
   - The solution is saved as `solution.py` in the current directory. It reads from standard input and writes the result to standard output.
