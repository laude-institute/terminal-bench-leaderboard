[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Beauty Pageant (Silver Level) [Brian Dean]

Hearing that the latest fashion trend was cows with three spots on their
hides, Farmer John has purchased an entire herd of three-spot cows. 
Unfortunately, fashion trends tend to change quickly, and the most popular
current fashion is cows with only one spot!  

FJ wants to make his herd more fashionable by painting each of his cows in
such a way that merges their three spots into one.  The hide of a cow is
represented by an N by M grid of characters like this:

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Here, each 'X' denotes part of a spot.  Two 'X's belong to the same spot if
they are vertically or horizontally adjacent (diagonally adjacent does not
count), so the figure above has exactly three spots.  All of the cows in
FJ's herd have exactly three spots.

FJ wants to use as little paint as possible to merge the three spots into
one.  In the example above, he can do this by painting only four
additional characters with 'X's (the new characters are marked with '*'s
below to make them easier to see).

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX*...XX...
.XXXX..**..XXX..
...*....XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Please help FJ determine the minimum number of new 'X's he must paint in
order to merge three spots into one large spot.

PROBLEM NAME: pageant

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M (1 <= N,M <= 50).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains a length-M string of 'X's and '.'
        specifying one row of the cow hide pattern.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6 16
................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

INPUT DETAILS:

The pattern in the input shows a cow hide with three distinct spots.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of new 'X's that must be added to the
        input pattern in order to obtain one single spot.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Four 'X's suffice to join the three spots into one.

**Formulating a grid connection solution**

The user is asking for a solution with four parts: restating the problem, providing a conceptual solution, writing pseudocode, and creating a Python solution without any external libraries. The focus is on connecting three components using the Steiner minimal tree concept to minimize node additions. To do this, I could label the spots 0, 1, and 2, and then use multi-source BFS to calculate the distances from each cell to the components, considering costs for moving between cells.
**Optimizing the BFS approach**

I’m thinking about simplifying the BFS method by treating 'X' as having a weight of 0 and '.' as having a weight of 1, which means I can use a 0-1 BFS. This allows me to calculate distances to all cells efficiently. For each cell, I’d sum the distances, adjusting for overlaps if the cell is '.', which reduces the count by 2. The plan involves finding three components using flood fill, running the BFS, and then computing the minimum total distance. I’ll implement everything as specified in solution.py without additional libraries, while ensuring I handle unreachable conditions by using a large INF value as a placeholder.

**1. Problem Restatement**  
We have an N×M grid containing exactly three connected “spots” of ‘X’ (connected orthogonally). We want to paint the fewest extra ‘X’ cells (turning '.' into 'X') so that all three spots become one connected component.

**2. Solution Concept**  
- Label the three existing spots (components 0,1,2) by flood-fill.  
- For each component i, compute a distance map dist[i][r][c] = minimum number of new ‘X’s needed to connect from any original X in component i to cell (r,c). Moving onto an existing ‘X’ costs 0; moving onto a ‘.’ costs 1. This is a 0–1 BFS.  
- Then for every cell (r,c), if all three dist[..][r][c] are finite, total cost to bring all three to (r,c) is dist0+dist1+dist2 minus 2 if (r,c) is ‘.’ (because that cell would be painted three times but counts once).  
- The answer is the minimum such total over all cells.

**3. Pseudocode**  
```
read N, M
read grid[N][M]

label = [[-1]*M for _ in range(N)]
components = []  // list of lists of (r,c)
for each cell (r,c):
    if grid[r][c]=='X' and label[r][c]==-1:
        flood fill from (r,c) marking label[][]=comp_id
        record all cells of this component in components[comp_id]
        comp_id += 1

for i in 0..2:
    dist[i] = [[INF]*M for _ in range(N)]
    deque = empty deque
    for (r,c) in components[i]:
        dist[i][r][c] = 0
        deque.appendleft((r,c))
    while deque not empty:
        r,c = deque.popleft()
        for each neighbor (nr,nc) in 4 directions:
            if out of bounds: continue
            cost = 0 if grid[nr][nc]=='X' else 1
            if dist[i][r][c] + cost < dist[i][nr][nc]:
                dist[i][nr][nc] = dist[i][r][c] + cost
                if cost==0: deque.appendleft((nr,nc))
                else: deque.append((nr,nc))

answer = INF
for all cells (r,c):
    if dist[0][r][c], dist[1][r][c], dist[2][r][c] all < INF:
        total = dist[0][r][c] + dist[1][r][c] + dist[2][r][c]
        if grid[r][c]=='.': total -= 2
        answer = min(answer, total)

print(answer)
```
