[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has lost his prize cow Bessie, and he needs to find her!

Fortunately, there is only one long path running across the farm, and Farmer
John knows that Bessie has to be at some location on this path.  If we think of
the path as a number line, then Farmer John is currently at position $x$ and
Bessie is currently at position $y$ (unknown to Farmer John).  If Farmer John
only knew where Bessie was located, he could walk directly to her, traveling a
distance of $|x - y|$.  Unfortunately, it is dark outside and Farmer John can't
see anything.  The only way he can find Bessie is to walk back and forth until
he eventually reaches her position.

Trying to figure out the best strategy for walking back and forth in his search,
Farmer John consults the computer science research literature and is
somewhat amused to find that this exact problem has not only been studied by
computer scientists in the past, but that it is actually called the "Lost Cow
Problem" (this is actually true!).

The recommended solution for Farmer John to find Bessie is to move to position
$x+1$, then reverse direction and move to position $x-2$, then to position
$x+4$, and so on, in a  "zig zag" pattern, each step moving twice as far from
his initial starting position as before.  As he has read during his study of algorithms
for solving the lost cow problem, this approach guarantees that he will at worst
travel 9 times the direct distance $|x-y|$ between himself and Bessie before he
finds her (this is also true, and the factor of 9 is actually the smallest such
worst case guarantee any strategy can achieve).

Farmer John is curious to verify this result.  Given $x$ and $y$, please compute
the  total distance he will travel according to the zig-zag search strategy above
until he finds Bessie.

INPUT FORMAT:
The single line of input contains two distinct space-separated integers $x$ and
$y$.  Both are in the range $0 \ldots 1,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print one line of output, containing the distance Farmer John will travel to
reach Bessie.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 6
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
9

[2025-09-03T05:08:37] thinking

**Implementing Lost Cow**

I need to tackle the USACO Bronze problem "Lost Cow." The goal is to simulate a back-and-forth search based on Farmer John's movements. Starting from position x
, he walks to x+1. If y is in that range, he finds it. During each leg of movement, he reverses direction after reaching a limit. His movements double each time
: 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on. I’ll calculate the total distance walked until he reaches y, considering full or partial distances for each leg. The constraints are ma
nageable, maxing out at 1000.
**Implementing the Lost Cow Problem**

I need to simulate Farmer John's movement between points x and y, where he moves incrementally based on a doubling pattern. He starts at x, moves to x+1, then x
-2, x+4, etc. I'll create a loop to calculate the distance he travels until he reaches y.

First, I'll define variables for current position and total distance. Then, I’ll set up the logic to check if y falls between his current position and target. I
f it does, I stop and sum the movements; otherwise, I update his position and keep counting.

Next, I'll write the pseudocode and ultimately implement it in a file named solution.py. I'll ensure it reads inputs correctly and outputs the total distance tr
aveled.

Here’s the completed solution:

**Restate the problem**
Given start position `x` and hidden target `y` on a number-line path, FJ performs an expanding “zig-zag” search: first to `x+1`, then `x-2`, then `x+4`, etc., d
oubling the distance each leg until he hits `y`. Compute the total distance traveled.

**Solution approach**
- Track current position (`curr`) starting at `x` and cumulative `total` distance.
- For step `i = 1,2,3…`, compute move distance = `2^(i-1)` and direction (right on odd steps, left on even).
- Determine the leg’s target = `x ± distance`.
- If `y` lies between `curr` and `target`, add only the partial distance to `y` and stop. Otherwise, add the full leg distance, update `curr`, and continue.

**Pseudocode**
```
read x, y
curr ← x
total ← 0
step ← 1
loop:
  dist ← 1 << (step-1)
  if step odd: target ← x + dist else target ← x - dist
  if y between curr and target:
    total += abs(y - curr)
    break
  total += abs(target - curr)
  curr ← target
  step += 1
print total
```

The solution is saved as `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or anything else!
