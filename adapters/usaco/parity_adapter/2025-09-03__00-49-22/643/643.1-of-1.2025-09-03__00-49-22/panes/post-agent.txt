[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow, always a fan of shiny objects, has taken up a hobby of mining
diamonds in her spare time!  She has collected $N$ diamonds ($N \leq 50,000$) of
varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in a pair of
display cases in the barn.

Since Bessie wants the diamonds in each of the two cases to be relatively similar in
size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the same case if their sizes
differ by more than $K$ (two diamonds can be displayed together in the same case if
their sizes differ by exactly $K$).  Given $K$, please help Bessie determine the
maximum number of diamonds she can display in both cases together.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq 1,000,000,000$).
The next $N$ lines each contain an integer giving the size of one of the
diamonds.  All sizes will be positive and will not exceed $1,000,000,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single positive integer, telling the maximum number of diamonds that
Bessie can showcase in total in both the cases.

**Solving diamond collector problem**

I’m looking to tackle a known problem called "diamond collector." The goal is to find two non-overlapping windows, or subarrays, in a sorted array so that the s
um of their lengths is maximized. Actually, they can overlap, but each diamond can belong to only one case. Essentially, I need to choose some diamonds for case
 #1 and others for case #2, maximizing the total assigned diamonds. This is about finding two subsets that are disjoint with ranges ≤ K and maximizing their siz
es. Sorting the array will help, and I'll determine the maximum window for each index.
**Maximizing window sums**

I need to find the maximum sum of two windows. One starts at index i with a length determined by `right[i]`, and I’ll also look at the best sum from beyond that
 window. I can preprocess this to know the best possible results after `i + right[i]`. The standard approach is to sort sizes and find the farthest j ensuring t
hat the difference is ≤ K, then compute maximum suffix arrays.

I’ll be careful about ensuring that the windows are disjoint, and I need to outline this in pseudocode and create a `solution.py` file.
**Implementing the solution**

I’m considering an alternate approach where I build a prefix best for the two windows that could be before the current one, but using the suffix method is fine
too. I’ll check a sample to confirm my lengths based on sorted sizes and K. The maximum sum initially appears when I compute the lengths, and I’ll save it into
`solution.py`.

It's straightforward: I’ll write steps to restate, conceptualize, and codify the solution, applying the patch to create this implementation efficiently.

1. Problem Restatement
Bessie has \(N\) diamonds of various sizes and two display cases. In each case, the size difference between any two diamonds can’t exceed \(K\). We need to pick
 disjoint subsets of diamonds for the two cases to maximize the total number displayed.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Sort the diamond sizes.
- For each starting index \(i\), use a two-pointer scan to find how many consecutive diamonds from \(i\) fit within size difference \(K\). Store this in `length
s[i]`.
- Build a suffix array `best[i]` holding the maximum single-case count from index \(i\) onward.
- For each \(i\), combine `lengths[i]` (first case) with `best[i + lengths[i]]` (second case starting after the first) to get a total. Track the maximum.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K
read sizes array
sort sizes
lengths = array of size N
j = 0
for i in 0..N-1:
    while j < N and sizes[j] - sizes[i] <= K:
        j += 1
    lengths[i] = j - i

best = array of size N+1, initialized 0
for i in N-1 down to 0:
    best[i] = max(lengths[i], best[i+1])

ans = 0
for i in 0..N-1:
    next_i = i + lengths[i]
    total = lengths[i] + (best[next_i] if next_i ≤ N else 0)
    ans = max(ans, total)

print(ans)
```

4. Implementation
The above logic is implemented in `solution.py` without any external libraries.
