[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is bringing his $N$ cows, conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$, to the
county fair, to compete in the annual bovine talent show!  His $i$th cow has a
weight $w_i$ and talent level $t_i$, both integers.

Upon arrival, Farmer John is quite surprised by the new rules for this year's 
talent show:

(i) A group of cows of total weight at least $W$ must be entered into the show
(in order to ensure strong teams of cows are competing, not just strong 
individuals), and

(ii) The group with the largest ratio of total talent to total weight shall win.

FJ observes that all of his cows together have weight at least $W$, so he should
be able to enter a team satisfying (i).  Help him determine the optimal ratio of
talent to weight he can achieve for any such team.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 250$) and $W$
($1 \leq W \leq 1000$). The next $N$ lines each describe a cow using two
integers $w_i$ ($1 \leq w_i \leq 10^6$) and $t_i$ ($1 \leq t_i \leq 10^3$).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please determine the largest possible ratio of total talent over total weight
Farmer John can achieve using a group of cows of total weight at least $W$.  If
your answer is $A$, please print out the floor of $1000A$ in order to keep the
output integer-valued (the floor operation discards any fractional part by
rounding down to an integer, if the number in question is not already an
integer).

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 15
20 21
10 11
30 31
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
1066

In this example, the best talent-to-weight ratio overall would be to use just
the single cow with talent 11 and weight 10, but since we need at least  15
units of weight, the optimal solution ends up being to use this cow plus the cow
with talent 21 and weight 20.  This gives a talent-to-weight ratio of
(11+21)/(10+20) = 32/30 = 1.0666666..., which when multiplied by 1000 and
floored gives 1066.

**Exploring optimization for cows**

I need to clarify the problem: we have up to 250 cows, with weights potentially reaching 1 million each, which makes the total weight sum huge. However, our target weight W is small, only 1000. It seems logical to limit our dynamic programming approach to weights up to W, focusing on combinations that meet or exceed it. A common strategy may involve binary searching on the ratio, maximizing the difference between talent and weight contribution to find suitable subsets.
**Optimizing using binary search**

I’m considering a binary search approach to find the maximum value A by checking if there exists a subset where the total weight is at least W and the talent sum meets the criteria of being greater than or equal to A times the weight. Since A can be fractional, I want to cap weight beyond W and leverage dynamic programming to optimize talent sums using both weights below and at W. This should allow me to efficiently determine the ratio of talent to weight while ensuring the conditions are met for subsets.
**Implementing optimizations for solution**

I’m looking into optimizing the process further. While the loops seem to be running at an acceptable speed, I can enhance performance by pre-storing pairs of weights and values for quicker access or recalculating values on the fly. I’m considering using Python's built-in functions with `enumerate` to speed up the dynamic programming aspect. Next, I'll get started on writing the Python code and save it into a file named solution.py as part of the patch. No need for testing just yet.

**Calculating weight dimensions**

I’m trying to figure out the weight sum lower bound, which is W, and how individual weights can be large. A trick is to treat any weight ≥ W as exactly W to simplify tracking. We need to determine if any weight yields a probability P ≥ 0, with a DP size around 1000 and N being small at 250. The DP approach has O(N*W) complexity. For each cow, I’m adjusting weights accordingly, using maximum values and iterating in reverse to update probabilities. If dp[W] is non-negative, I can then binary search for the feasible ratio R.
**Planning for binary search and implementation**

I'm looking at how to apply binary search to achieve a precise K value, which is the floored product of 1000 and R, ranging from 0 to maybe 1e6 since the ratio is capped at 1000. I'll check if there exists a subset with the appropriate sum. Using dynamic programming on this avoids using floating-point numbers. For the implementation, I’ll adjust classic DP methods and create a list for weights, implementing it as a script named solution.py. 

Next, I’ll outline the steps and provide pseudocode, then finalize the code. I'll need to ensure apply_patch is used at the end to add that script. Let's get this rolling!

**Problem Restatement**

We need to pick a subset of \(N\) cows (each with weight \(w_i\) and talent \(t_i\)) such that the total weight is at least \(W\), and the ratio  
\[
\frac{\sum t_i}{\sum w_i}
\]
is maximized. The answer requested is \(\lfloor1000\times(\text{max ratio})\rfloor\).

**Solution Concept**

- Define an integer \(K = \lfloor1000\times(\text{ratio})\rfloor\). We binary-search on \(K\) from 0 up to 1 000 000.
- For a candidate \(K\), transform each cow’s “profit” to  
  \[
    p_i = 1000\,t_i - K\,w_i.
  \]
- We want to know if there exists a subset of cows of total weight \(\ge W\) whose total \(p_i\) sum is \(\ge0\).  
- We use a knapsack-style DP of size \(W+1\), capping any weight above \(W\) to index \(W\).  
- If achievable, we push the binary search lower bound up; otherwise, we decrease it.

This runs in \(O(\log(\text{max K}) \times N \times W)\), which is efficient for \(N\le250\), \(W\le1000\).

**Pseudocode**

```
read N, W
read list of (w_i, t_i)

function can_achieve(cows, W, K):
  dp[0..W] = -∞; dp[0] = 0
  for each (w, t) in cows:
    p = 1000*t - K*w
    new_dp = dp copy
    for j from 0..W:
      if dp[j] > -∞:
        nj = min(W, j+w)
        new_dp[nj] = max(new_dp[nj], dp[j] + p)
    dp = new_dp
  return dp[W] >= 0

# binary search K in [0,1_000_000]
lo = 0; hi = 1_000_000
while lo < hi:
  mid = (lo+hi+1)//2
  if can_achieve(cows, W, mid):
    lo = mid
  else:
    hi = mid - 1

print(lo)
```
