[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But something about his log doesn't look quite
right...

Farmer John wants to find out how many breakouts have occurred since he started
his log. However, he suspects that the cows have tampered with his log, and all
he knows for sure is that he started his log on the day of a breakout. Please
help him determine, for each number of breakouts that might have occurred since
he started the log, the minimum number of log entries that must have been
tampered with.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the
counter was at $a_i$, unless the cows tampered with that day's log entry.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of $N$ integers, one per line. The $i$th
integer should be the minimum over all possible breakout sequences with $i$
breakouts, of the number of log entries that are inconsistent with that
sequence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
6
1 1 2 0 0 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
2
1

4

If there was only 1 breakout, then the correct log would look like 0 1 2 3 4 5,
which is 4 entries different from the given log.

If there were 2 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 3 0 1,
which is 2 entries different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first and fifth days.

If there were 3 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 0 0 1,
which is just 1 entry different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first, fourth, and fifth days.

And so on.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-09-03T06:20:00] thinking

**Analyzing breakouts**

I'm thinking about how the first day is always a breakout. Since breakouts occur k times, with k being at least 1, I need to focus on minimizing mismatches over
 the assignments. For each k from 1 to N, I’ll consider dynamic programming to track mismatches, defining state as dp[i][j], which represents minimum mismatches
 up to day i with j breakouts, especially when considering if day i itself is a breakout. It’s crucial to model sequences for clarity.
**Refining dynamic programming**

I realize that each day's value depends on its distance from the last breakout, which is critical for the sequence. I need to redefine my dynamic programming ap
proach to capture this. I’ll set up dp[i][j] as the minimum mismatches up to day i with exactly j breakouts, ensuring day i is a breakout. The transitions invol
ve checking previous breakout positions and computing costs for segments without additional breakouts. I'll precompute the necessary cost segments and mismatche
s for efficient calculations, sticking to a structured DP method that is manageable given N ≤ 100.
**Exploring breakout conditions**

I'm considering whether the first breakout has to be on day one. The scenario shows it starts on a breakout day, making day one a breakout. That means for j=1,
the only valid breakout is day one, so dp[1][1] works, while dp[i>1][1] doesn't. For k=1, the correct sequence has day one as the only breakout. When k≥2, I nee
d to account for multiple breakouts within segmented costs, focusing on calculating costs between and afterwards. I also need to precompute these costs correctl
y to avoid double counting.
**Clarifying implementation steps**

I'm navigating some complexities related to double counting and defining costs. For the cost calculations, especially in the tail, I need to ensure I'm not incl
uding any mismatches I’ve already counted. I plan to calculate costs meticulously by precomputing costBetween and costTailNoP.

Next, I’ll initialize the dp structure and compute minimal costs efficiently. Once everything is in place, I need to restate my approach and develop pseudocode
before I move to implement it in a Python file named solution.py. I think it's essential to follow a clear sequence for clarity and accuracy.

1. Plain English Restatement
- We have N daily log entries of a counter that resets to 0 on a breakout and increments by 1 each subsequent day without a breakout.
- Day 1 is known to be a breakout.
- Given possibly tampered logs `a[i]`, for each possible total number of breakouts k (1≤k≤N), find the minimum number of entries that disagree with some valid b
reakout pattern having exactly k breakouts.

2. Conceptual Approach
- Model breakouts as split points dividing the year into segments. Each segment starts with a breakout (counter = 0) and then counts up by 1 each day.
- Precompute:
  • `costBetween[p][i]`: cost (mismatches) if there’s a breakout at day p and the next breakout at day i, with none between.
  • `costTailNoP[p]`: cost from day p+1 to N if the last breakout is on day p.
- Use DP `dp[i][j]` = minimum mismatches covering days 1..i with exactly j breakouts, where the j-th breakout is on day i.
- Transition: for each `dp[i][j]`, try all possible previous breakout days p< i:
  dp[i][j] = min(dp[p][j-1] + costBetween[p][i]).
- Finally, for each k, answer[k] = min over p of (dp[p][k] + costTailNoP[p]).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N and array a[1..N]
compute costBetween[p][i] for all 1≤p<i≤N:
  costBetween[p][i] = sum_{m=p+1..i-1}(a[m] != m-p) + (a[i]!=0)

compute costTailNoP[p] for p=1..N:
  costTailNoP[p] = sum_{m=p+1..N}(a[m] != m-p)

initialize dp[N+1][N+1] = INF
dp[1][1] = (a[1]!=0)

for j in 2..N:
  for i in j..N:
    dp[i][j] = min over p in [j-1..i-1] of dp[p][j-1] + costBetween[p][i]

for k in 1..N:
  ans[k] = min over p in [k..N] of dp[p][k] + costTailNoP[p]
  print ans[k]
```

I've implemented this in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or make adjustments!
