[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Optimal Milking [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John has recently purchased a new barn containing N milking machines
(1 <= N <= 40,000), conveniently numbered 1..N and arranged in a row.

Milking machine i is capable of extracting M(i) units of milk per day (1 <=
M(i) <= 100,000).  Unfortunately, the machines were installed so
close together that if a machine i is in use on a particular day, its two
neighboring machines cannot be used that day (endpoint machines have only
one neighbor, of course).  Farmer John is free to select different subsets
of machines to operate on different days.

Farmer John is interested in computing the maximum amount of milk he can
extract over a series of D days (1 <= D <= 50,000).  At the beginning of
each day, he has enough time to perform maintenance on one selected milking
machine i, thereby changing its daily milk output M(i) from that day forward.
Given a list of these daily modifications, please tell Farmer John how much
milk he can produce over D days (note that this number might not fit into a
32-bit integer).

PROBLEM NAME: optmilk

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The values of N and D.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the initial value of M(i).

* Lines 2+N..1+N+D: Line 1+N+d contains two integers i and m,
        indicating that Farmer John updates the value of M(i) to m at
        the beginning of day d.

machine 5 is updated to output 2 unit of milk, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum total amount of milk FJ can produce over D days.

OUTPUT DETAILS:

On day one, the optimal amount of milk is 2+4 = 6 (also achievable as

optimal amount is 10+3+2=15.

[2025-09-03T05:39:19] thinking

**Clarifying milk updates**

I'm considering initial conditions where we set dp[-1] and dp[0] to zero. It seems that each day, we update the matrix and get a new total of milk produced. The
re’s a challenge with accounting for the first day since no milking occurs before the first update. I need to iterate through the updates over D days, adjusting
 M accordingly. For instance, with an initial M of [1,2,3,4,5], after updates, I'll calculate the optimal milk yield day by day. The cumulative sum looks promis
ing, even with large values.
**Evaluating segment tree structure**

I realize that the sum of alternate machines must fit within certain constraints, and considering large integer values in Python is essential. Using a segment t
ree with matrices seems like a fast solution, despite the complexity of updates.

With 50k updates entailing numerous operations, I’ll implement it carefully. The segment tree will require a size that's the next power of two. I'll focus on th
e merging process and ensure identity matrices properly reflect no effect on machine operations. It's time to write pseudocode and clarify the problem, laying i
t out in plain English.
**Using apply_patch correctly**

It seems apply_patch is actually a shell command rather than a tool I can directly manipulate. I need to call it through a shell function, but the instructions
say it should be handled via the shell command format. It's confirmed that apply_patch isn’t part of the functions namespace but should be executed as a recogni
zed command.

The process requires me to include an explanation in the channel message, and then I’ll call shell in the commentary channel to execute the apply_patch command.
 I'll prepare the explanation first, then reference the solution.py file in my final message while ensuring the apply_patch call happens separately.
**Constructing the patch string**

I’m putting together the patch string for solution.py, which will include the necessary code and functions. But I notice a crucial detail about the tree initial
ization—it needs a deep copy to avoid reference issues. The way I was doing it before could lead to shared sublists, which isn’t what I want.

Instead, I’ll ensure that each matrix entry gets its unique sublists during initialization. Also, using sys.stdin.read().split will speed up input reading. Now
I'm ready to finalize the messages for the channel, summarizing the problem restatement, the conceptual solution, and the pseudocode before indicating that I'll
 create the solution.py file, followed by the necessary shell call in commentary.

1. Restated Problem
- We have N machines in a line, each with a daily milk output M(i). Each day we pick a subset of machines so that no two adjacent machines run, maximizing total
 milk that day. Over D days, each day we first change one machine’s output M(i), then farm maximally that day. Sum the daily maxima.

2. Solution Concept
- The “no-adjacent” max-sum on a path is a classic DP: dp[i] = max(dp[i–1], dp[i–2] + M[i]). Recomputing in O(N) per update is too slow (N·D up to 2e9).
- We use a segment tree storing 2×2 “max-plus” matrices that represent the DP transition for each machine.
- Each leaf’s matrix encodes how adding that machine transforms the DP state. Internal nodes store the composition (max-plus product) of their children.
- On each update we replace one leaf’s matrix and re-compute O(log N) ancestors. The overall DP result dp[N] is read in O(1) from the root. Sum these over all d
ays.

3. Pseudocode

```
read n, d
read initial array M[0..n-1]
build segment tree of size S = next power of two ≥ n
identity matrix I = [[0, -∞], [-∞, 0]]
for each leaf i<S:
    if i<n: leaf[i] = [[-∞,0],[M[i],0]]
    else:     leaf[i] = I
build internal nodes bottom-up:
    node = combine(left_child, right_child)
where combine(A,B) = B ⊗ A in max-plus semiring

total = 0
for each of the d updates:
    read idx, new_m
    update leaf at idx to [[-∞,0],[new_m,0]]
    re-build its ancestors via combine
    read root matrix R
    daily_max = max(R[1][0], R[1][1])
    total += daily_max

print total
```

4. Created solution.py implementing this in pure Python with O((N+D) log N) time.
