[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Bovine Alliance [Mark Gordon, 2011]

Bessie and her bovine pals from nearby farms have finally decided that they
are going to start connecting their farms together by trails in an effort
to form an alliance against the farmers.  The cows in each of the N (1 <= N
<= 100,000) farms were initially instructed to build a trail to exactly one
other farm, for a total of N trails.  However months into the project only
M (1 <= M < N) of these trails had actually been built.

Arguments between the farms over which farms already built a trail now
threaten to split apart the cow alliance.  To ease tension, Bessie wishes
to calculate how many ways the M trails that exist so far could have been
built.  For example, if there is a trail connecting farms 3 and 4, then one
possibility is that farm 3 built the trail, and the other possibility is
that farm 4 built the trail.  Help Bessie by calculating the number of
different assignments of trails to the farms that built them, modulo
1,000,000,007.  Two assignments are considered different if there is at
least one trail built by a different farm in each assignment.

PROBLEM NAME: alliance

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers N and M

* Lines 2..1+M: Line i+1 describes the ith trail.  Each line contains
        two space-separated integers u_i and v_i (1 <= u_i, v_i <= N,
        u_i != v_i) describing the pair of farms connected by the
        trail.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 4
1 2
3 2
4 5
4 5

INPUT DETAILS:

Note that there can be two trails between the same pair of farms.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line containing the number of assignments of trails
        to farms, taken modulo 1,000,000,007.  If no assignment
        satisfies the above conditions output 0.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 possible assignments.  Letting {a,b,c,d} mean that farm 1
builds trail a, farm 2 builds trail b, farm 3 builds trail c, and farm 4
builds trail d, the assignments are:
{2, 3, 4, 5}

[2025-09-03T05:22:54] thinking

**Analyzing tree structures**

I’m thinking about counting nodes in a tree. If I have a star configuration with one center node connected to others, for example, a tree with four nodes should
 have three edges. To check, I can look at the edges like (1-2), (1-3), and (1-4). I need to orient these edges to ensure no node has more than one outgoing edg
e. There are a few cases: the center can build one edge or none, which adds to the combinations. For each way of selecting edges, I conclude there’s one way for
 all leaves to connect back to the center.
**Evaluating unicyclic components**

I’m analyzing a node structure and checking valid combinations. For a unicyclic component, the count equals the cycle length, meaning the number of nodes in tha
t cycle. For instance, a triangle has three nodes and a cycle length of three, while a double edge has a length of two. I need to be careful when trees are atta
ched to cycles. The formula could involve factors from both components, considering edges and nodes specifically, including cases where cycles and attached tree
s play a role in counting valid assignments. I want to confirm my findings through examples.
**Analyzing cycle orientations**

I'm breaking down unicyclic components into their main cycles and attached trees. For a single edge tree, the factor is two, but I realize I need to check the o
verall assignments. The goal is to orient cycle edges so that each node on the cycle has at most one outgoing edge—this includes edges from any attached trees.
I can confirm valid orientations through examples and checking combinations. Ultimately, for the triangle cycle, I find two valid orientations: the count matche
s established expectations. As a result, valid orientations remain consistent for cycles, regardless of their length.
**Finalizing solution design**

I’m working through the unicyclic components and their factors. For edges and nodes, I need to ensure each edge has an orientation and recognize combinations. I
t's essential to count components carefully, noting how tree attachments impact overall factors. The crux of my solution involves using a data structure to grou
p nodes while tracking edges and counts efficiently. I’ll lay out my solution in steps, moving towards implementing it with path compression and union by size i
n my code. It feels like I’m on the right track!

**1. Restatement**

We have \(N\) farms and \(M\) undirected trails (possibly with duplicates). Each built trail must have exactly one “builder” endpoint, and no farm may build mor
e than one trail. Count the number of ways to assign each trail to one of its two endpoints so that no node has out-degree > 1, modulo \(10^9+7\).

**2. Solution Sketch**

- Build a disjoint-set union (DSU) over the farms, keeping for each component:
  - `size`: number of nodes \(N_c\)
  - `edges`: number of edges \(M_c\)

- As we process each undirected edge \((u,v)\), we union their sets (if different) and increment the combined edge count; if already in the same set, we just in
crement its edge count.

- After reading all edges, each DSU root describes a connected component:
  - If \(M_c > N_c\): too many edges → at least one node would build two edges → **0** ways overall.
  - If \(M_c = N_c-1\) (a tree or isolated node): there are \(N_c\) valid orientations (each tree contributes factor = number of nodes).
  - If \(M_c = N_c\) (exactly one cycle plus trees): there are **2** valid orientations.
  - Otherwise (\(M_c < N_c-1\)) cannot happen in a connected comp by construction.

- Multiply the per-component factors modulo \(10^9+7\).

This runs in \(O((N+M)\,\alpha(N))\), easily handling \(N,M\le10^5\).

**3. Pseudocode**

```
MOD ← 1_000_000_007

read N, M
initialize DSU parent[i]=i, size[i]=1, edges[i]=0

function find(x):
    if parent[x]!=x:
        parent[x] ← find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

function unite(a,b):
    ra ← find(a); rb ← find(b)
    if ra == rb:
        edges[ra] += 1
    else:
        # union by size
        if size[ra] < size[rb]: swap(ra,rb)
        parent[rb] ← ra
        size[ra] += size[rb]
        edges[ra] += edges[rb] + 1

for each of M lines:
    read u, v
    unite(u, v)

ans ← 1
for i in 1..N:
    if find(i)==i:   # root
        Nc ← size[i]
        Mc ← edges[i]
        if Mc > Nc:
            print(0); exit
        if Mc == Nc - 1:
            ans ← ans * Nc % MOD
        else:  # Mc == Nc
            ans ← ans * 2 % MOD

print(ans)
```

**4. solution.py**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    parent = list(range(N+1))
    size = [1]*(N+1)
    edges = [0]*(N+1)

    def find(x):
        while parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
            x = parent[x]
        return x

    def unite(u, v):
        ru, rv = find(u), find(v)
        if ru == rv:
            edges[ru] += 1
        else:
            # union by size
            if size[ru] < size[rv]:
                ru, rv = rv, ru
            parent[rv] = ru
            size[ru] += size[rv]
            edges[ru] += edges[rv] + 1

    for _ in range(M):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        unite(u, v)

    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        if find(i) == i:
            Nc = size[i]
            Mc = edges[i]
            if Mc > Nc:
                print(0)
                return
            if Mc == Nc - 1:
                ans = ans * Nc % MOD
            else:  # Mc == Nc
                ans = ans * 2 % MOD

    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This reads from standard input, builds the DSU, classifies each component as a tree or unicyclic, and multiplies the corresponding factors under the modulo.
