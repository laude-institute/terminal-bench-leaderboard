[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie has recently received a painting set, and she wants to paint the long
fence at one end of her pasture.  The fence consists of $N$ consecutive 1-meter 
segments ($1\le N\le 10^5$).  Bessie has 26 different colors available, which
she labels with the letters 'A' through 'Z' in increasing order of darkness ('A'
is a very light color, and 'Z' is very dark).  She can therefore describe the
desired color she wants to paint each fence segment as a length-$N$ string where
each character is a letter.

Initially, all fence segments are uncolored.  Bessie can color any  contiguous
range of segments with a single color in a single brush stroke as long as she
never paints a lighter color over a darker color (she can only paint darker
colors over lighter colors).  

For example, an initially uncolored segment of length four can be colored as
follows:


.... -> BBB. -> BBLL -> BQQL

Running short on time, Bessie thinks she may need to leave some consecutive
range of fence segments unpainted! Currently, she is considering $Q$  candidate
ranges ($1\le Q\le 10^5$), each described by  by two integers $(a,b)$ with
$1 \leq a \leq b \leq N$ giving the indices of  endpoints of the range
$a \ldots b$ of segments to be left unpainted.

For each candidate range, what is the minimum number of strokes needed to paint
every fence segment outside those in the range with its desired color while 
leaving all fence segments inside the range uncolored?  Note that Bessie does
not actually do any painting during this process, so the answers for each
candidate range are independent. 

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $Q$.

The next line contains a string of length $N$ characters representing the
desired color  for each fence segment.

The next $Q$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$
representing a candidate range to possibly leave unpainted.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $Q$ candidates, output the answer on a new line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
8 2
ABBAABCB
3 6
1 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
4
3

In this example, excluding the sub-range corresponding to the desired pattern
$\texttt{BAAB}$ requires four strokes to paint while excluding $\texttt{ABBA}$ 
requires only three.


.... -> AA.. -> ABBB -> ABCB

SCORING:
Test cases 1-4 satisfy $N,Q\le 100$.Test cases 5-7 satisfy
$N,Q\le 5000$.Test cases 8-13 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Solving painting fence problem**

I'm working on a USACO problem about painting a fence with dynamic queries that exclude a segment. Essentially, I need to compute the minimal strokes outside that segment by considering the prefix before and the suffix after it. The minimal strokes for the entire segment can be identified using a stack-based algorithm. I’ll iterate through the array and maintain a stack of colors, counting when strokes are necessary based on color changes. This should lead me to the correct solution while excluding the specified segment.
**Optimizing painting algorithm**

I'm breaking down the approach to painting the segments outside a specified range. I'll compute strokes by summing the results from the prefix and suffix separately. This involves painting segments [1, a-1] and [b+1, N], and I’ll use stacks to track color changes. For each query, I’ll define prefix and suffix arrays to optimize calculations, where strokes are managed through stack operations. The algorithm will efficiently handle cases for up to 100,000 elements, and I’ll implement the complete solution in Python.
**Implementing painting solution**

I need to read the inputs, which include the values for N and Q, as well as the string. I’ll create the prefix and suffix arrays, ensuring the structures are sized appropriately. The prefix will be N+1 and the suffix N+2. I'll write detailed pseudocode first and then implement the solution in a single Python file. 

I’ll maintain the stacks efficiently using lists and reset them correctly, ensuring I compute strokes while processing the string. I’ll code now and test the sample queries to ensure accuracy.

**Ensuring code execution**

I need to make sure we include the shebang line and that it’s correct. We should also consider making the code executable, although it might not be strictly necessary. The code itself seems to be correct, so now I'll test it with some sample input to verify everything is functioning as expected. Let’s move forward with this approach!

**Restated Problem**
- We have a fence of _N_ segments, each initially unpainted.
- Each segment’s target color is given by a letter ‘A’–‘Z’ (‘A’ is lightest, ‘Z’ darkest).
- A single brush stroke can paint any contiguous range to one color, but you may never paint a lighter color over a darker one.
- We have _Q_ queries, each specifying a sub-range [a,b] to leave unpainted.
- For each query, compute the minimum strokes to paint exactly the segments outside [a,b] to their target colors (independently for each query).

**Solution Concept**
- Painting from left to right, the minimum strokes equals the number of times you “push” a new darker color onto a monotonic stack (popping any darker colors before painting a lighter one).
- Similarly, painting from right to left on the suffix gives the strokes needed there.
- Precompute:
  - `pre[i]` = strokes to paint segments 1…_i_.
  - `suf[i]` = strokes to paint segments _i_…_N_ (scanned in reverse).
- For query [a,b], answer = `pre[a-1]` + `suf[b+1]`.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, Q
read string S of length N
initialize pre[0]=0, empty stack, strokes=0
for i in 1..N:
    c = S[i-1]
    while stack not empty and stack.top > c: pop
    if stack.top != c:
        push c; strokes += 1
    pre[i] = strokes

initialize suf[N+1]=0, empty stack, strokes=0
for i in N..1:
    c = S[i-1]
    while stack not empty and stack.top > c: pop
    if stack.top != c:
        push c; strokes += 1
    suf[i] = strokes

for each query (a,b):
    left = pre[a-1]
    right = (b+1 ≤ N) ? suf[b+1] : 0
    print(left + right)
```

**solution.py**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    it = iter(data)
    n, q = map(int, (next(it), next(it)))
    s = next(it)

    # Prefix strokes
    pre = [0]*(n+1)
    stack, strokes = [], 0
    for i, ch in enumerate(s, start=1):
        while stack and stack[-1] > ch:
            stack.pop()
        if not stack or stack[-1] != ch:
            stack.append(ch)
            strokes += 1
        pre[i] = strokes

    # Suffix strokes (reverse)
    suf = [0]*(n+2)
    stack, strokes = [], 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        ch = s[i-1]
        while stack and stack[-1] > ch:
            stack.pop()
        if not stack or stack[-1] != ch:
            stack.append(ch)
            strokes += 1
        suf[i] = strokes

    # Answer queries
    out = []
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b = map(int, (next(it), next(it)))
        left = pre[a-1]
        right = suf[b+1] if b < n else 0
        out.append(str(left + right))

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(out))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This runs in O(N + Q) time and uses simple stacks without extra libraries.
