[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In order to improve their physical fitness, the cows have taken up gymnastics!
Farmer John designates his favorite cow Bessie to coach the $N$ other cows and
to assess their progress as they learn various gymnastic skills.

In each of $K$ practice sessions ($1 \leq K \leq 10$), Bessie ranks the $N$ cows according to their
performance ($1 \leq N \leq 20$).  Afterward, she is curious about the consistency in these rankings.
A pair of two distinct cows is consistent if one cow did better than the
other one in every practice session.

Help Bessie compute the total number of consistent pairs.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains two positive integers $K$ and $N$. The next $K$ lines will each contain the
integers $1 \ldots N$ in some order, indicating the rankings of the cows (cows
are identified by the numbers $1 \ldots N$). If $A$ appears before $B$ in one of
these lines, that means cow $A$ did better than cow $B$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output, on a single line, the number of consistent pairs.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 4
4 1 2 3
4 1 3 2
4 2 1 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

The consistent pairs of cows are $(1,4)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(1,3)$.

[2025-09-03T06:11:39] thinking

**Analyzing ranking pairs**

I'm checking pairs of cows to determine if one consistently outranks another across all sessions. A pair is consistent if one cow consistently performs better i
n every practice session. For example, pairs like (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) are consistent, meaning cow 4 always ranks above 1, 2, and 3. However, 2 doesn't consi
stently outrank 4, so (2,4) is valid since 4 outperforms 2, but they still list unordered, putting the smaller number first.
**Developing solution logic**

I'm focusing on building an array to represent cow rankings. For each session, I'll store positions that indicate their ranks. Then, for every pair of cows, I n
eed to check if their rankings maintain the same order across all sessions to count them. Essentially, I’m conceptualizing how to loop through pairs and check t
heir consistency. The pseudocode will guide me: reading input, building positions, and implementing the solution in a new file. I’ll ensure it's clean, without
unnecessary comments, and written in Python 3.
**Restating the problem**

I need to count the number of pairs of cows whose rankings are consistent across multiple sessions. This means for each pair, one cow must consistently outrank
the other.

**Conceptual solution**
I’ll gather the data for each session, record the rankings, and then check each pair of cows to see if one always ranks higher than the other across all session
s.

**Pseudocode solution**
1. Read the number of sessions and cows.
2. Store rankings in a list of dictionaries.
3. Loop through all pairs of cows.
4. Count how many pairs maintain a consistent ranking.
5. Print the result.

I’ll ensure this is saved into solution.py.

1. Restatement:
- We need to count how many unordered pairs of cows have the same relative ranking (one always above the other) across all practice sessions.

2. Conceptual solution:
- Read K sessions of N rankings.
- For each session, record each cow’s position.
- For every pair of cows (i, j), check if i outranks j in every session or vice versa.
- Increment a counter when one of those holds true.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read K, N
read all K sessions into list of lists
build pos[k][cow] = rank index
count = 0
for i in 1..N:
    for j in i+1..N:
        if all(pos[k][i] < pos[k][j] for k in 0..K-1)
           or all(pos[k][j] < pos[k][i] for k in 0..K-1):
            count += 1
print count
```
