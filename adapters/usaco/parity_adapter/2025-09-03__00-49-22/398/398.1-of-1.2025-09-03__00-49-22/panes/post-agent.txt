[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25,000), each with an associated length.
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7
4 5 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the
house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's
        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a
        single pathway.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4
(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,
of total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.

**Analyzing path optimization**

I'm thinking through how each edge in the path can be adjusted. If we double any edge, we should recompute the shortest path to maximize the increase, but with
25,000 edges and 250 nodes, the computational load becomes excessively large, around 600 million operations. It might make sense to only consider edges that aff
ect the shortest path directly. However, multiple shortest paths complicate things, as cows could influence the path length by blocking certain edges. I'm tryin
g to clarify how changes in edges impact the overall path.
**Exploring edge adjustments**

I’m considering the impact of doubling edges on the original shortest path (SP). Doubling an edge that wasn’t part of the initial SP might not change the path a
t all, but if it becomes part of the new SP, that could make a difference. I realize it’s most effective to focus on edges in the original SP since they directl
y influence the overall path. My plan involves running Dijkstra's algorithm after modifying edge weights, tracking the maximum change. The complexity seems mana
geable within the provided constraints.
**Preparing implementation details**

I'm working through how to implement the adjacency list, where edges will be stored twice. I think it might be simplest to keep an edge ID with each entry, as t
his would make it easier to modify weights when doubling edges. I’ll use mutable lists instead of tuples to accommodate weight changes. I also need a plan to ru
n Dijkstra’s algorithm to adjust and track parent edges correctly before reconstructing paths.

Now, I’ll craft the final steps, providing restatement, conceptualization, pseudocode, and saving everything as solution.py, which I should implement in one go
without external libraries. Let's get coding!
**Finalizing the Python code**

I've written the implementation for Dijkstra’s algorithm in `solution.py`. The function calculates the shortest path from the start node and reconstructs the pa
th using parent edges. It doubles each edge's weight to check for potential increases in the path length and records the maximum increase found. It seems to be
working well, and now it’s time to create a patch for this file. I’m adding each line with a plus sign for clarity. Let's proceed!

**Clarifying the problem and solution plans**

The user asks me to break down the problem into simple terms first. Then, I need to plan a solution in plain English, followed by writing pseudocode. Finally, I
 must create a Python file with the solution using only the standard library. The task involves using a heap-based approach to Dijkstra's algorithm to compute t
he shortest path once, and then analyzing how doubling the length of edges can impact the distance, focusing on maximizing that increase. However, doubling an e
dge not on the original path won't change the shortest path length, which might affect the calculations.
**Analyzing edge doubling impacts**

I'm considering whether doubling edges not on the shortest path could still influence what ends up being the shortest path. Doubling edges outside of the known
shortest path won't change its length since it uses different edges. So, I should only focus on edges within some shortest path. However, the original shortest
path might not be unique, and cows want to maximize FJ's chosen path after doubling.

For every edge considered, I will double it, run the algorithm, and check the impact. Given the constraints, I need to optimize my approach to reduce operations
 since running many iterations could be too slow in Python. It seems feasible if I stick to edges from the original shortest path to keep my operations manageab
le.
**Optimizing the shortest path approach**

I’m thinking about further optimizations that could help narrow down which edges to consider when doubling. The idea is to focus on edges in the shortest path,
with no more than about 249 edges per path. In a worst-case scenario, using Dijkstra's algorithm could yield around 50 million relaxations, which might be pushi
ng it for Python, but could work with PyPy.

However, I need to ensure I'm considering all edges that belong to any shortest path to account for potential maximum increases. The plan would involve checking
 conditions based on distances from the start and end points after running Dijkstra’s algorithm. Yet, since the number of edges could rise significantly, I may
need to rethink how to manage computations, especially if it could lead to impractical amounts of iterations.

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing Dijkstra to find the shortest path, then iteratively doubling each edge on that path to measure the maximum increase. Let
me know if you’d like to run tests or see more details!
