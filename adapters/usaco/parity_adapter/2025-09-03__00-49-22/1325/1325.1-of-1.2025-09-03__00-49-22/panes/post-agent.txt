[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, 2x the default.**
To celebrate the start of spring, Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) have invented an intriguing new dance, where they stand in a circle and
re-order themselves in a predictable way.

Specifically, there are $N$ positions around the circle, numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$, with position $0$ following position $N-1$.  A cow resides at
each position.  The cows are also numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$.  Initially, cow $i$ starts in position $i$.  You are told a set of $K$ positions $0=A
_1<A_2< \ldots< A_K<N$ that are "active", meaning the cows in these positions are the next to move ($1 \leq K \leq N$).

In each minute of the dance, two things happen.  First, the cows in the active positions rotate: the cow at position $A_1$ moves to position $A_2$, the cow at p
osition $A_2$ moves to position $A_3$, and so on, with the cow at position $A_K$ moving to position $A_1$.  All of these $K$ moves happen simultaneously, so the
 after the rotation is complete, all of the active positions still contain exactly one cow.  Next, the active positions themselves shift:
$A_1$ becomes $A_1+1$, $A_2$ becomes $A_2+1$, and so on (if $A_i = N-1$ for some active position, then $A_i$ circles back around to $0$).

Please calculate the order of the cows after $T$ minutes of the dance ($1\le T\le 10^9$).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $T$.

The second line contains $K$ integers representing the initial set of active positions
$A_1,A_2, \ldots A_K$.  Recall that $A_1 = 0$ and that these are given in increasing order.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the order of the cows after $T$ minutes, starting with the cow in position $0$, separated by
spaces.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
0 2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 2 3 4 0

For the example above, here are the cow orders and $A$ for the first four
timesteps:


Initial, T = 0: order = [0 1 2 3 4], A = [0 2 3]
T = 1: order = [3 1 0 2 4]

[2025-09-03T05:13:59] thinking

**Exploring cow movement tracking**

I'm considering how to track cow movement over a certain duration. Each minute, a cow at position p moves to the next active position if it’s in the active set
or stays put otherwise. This feels complicated. I might look at the cow's relative position within a shifting structure. Maybe defining a transit graph could he
lp, but I need to find a direct formula for the cow's final position by working backward. Let's clarify the cow's initial index to determine where it ends up.
**Analyzing cow position tracking**

At minute 1, I rotate positions according to the initial arrangement. After T minutes, I've gone through a series of rotations, but the final cow arrangement is
 based on the rotation at minute T, with no further shifts affecting them. My goal is to find the final position for each initial cow position. It seems more ef
fective to invert this process, tracking positions in a way that allows static definitions of active positions. I’ll redefine positions relative to shifts to si
mplify computation and visualize the movements.
**Preparing solution code**

I'm planning to create a `solution.py` file with the necessary code. First, I'll read input values for N, K, and T, and process the list A. I'll set up an array
 to track the next active positions and another to represent the final positions of the cows. I need to account for cycles in cow movements, using a visited arr
ay to manage them. The final output will reflect the cows' arrangement after T minutes. I'll ensure to format everything properly and then apply the necessary u
pdates to save `solution.py`.

**Restatement**
Farmer John's \(N\) cows stand on positions \(0\ldots N-1\). Each minute:
- The cows on a shifting set of \(K\) “active” positions rotate among those spots.
- Then those active positions themselves advance by 1 (mod \(N\)).

Given the initial active list \(A\) (starting with 0) and a large \(T\), compute the final cow order.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Re-index positions to remove the shifting of active spots: let \(q(t)=p(t)-t\). In this frame, the active set is static.
- Define a single permutation \(F\) on \(q\): if \(q\) is an active index \(A_i\), it maps to \((A_{i+1}-1)\mod N\); otherwise to \((q-1)\mod N\).
- \(F\) is a fixed permutation. We need \(F^T\) applied to each starting \(q(0)=i\). Decompose \(F\) into cycles, and for each element jump \(T\mod\text{cycle\_
len}\) steps forward.
- Recover the true final position by \(p(T)=(q(T)+T)\bmod N\).
- Finally, invert to list which cow sits at each position.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K, T
read active list A[0..K-1]

# Build F
next_active = array[N] initialized to -1
for i in 0..K-1:
    next_active[A[i]] = A[(i+1)%K]
for x in 0..N-1:
    if next_active[x] != -1:
        F[x] = (next_active[x] - 1) mod N
    else:
        F[x] = (x - 1) mod N

# Decompose cycles and compute F^T
visited = array[N] false
to = array[N]
for i in 0..N-1:
    if not visited[i]:
        build cycle by following F until repeat
        L = length of cycle
        step = T mod L
        for each index idx and value val in cycle:
            to[val] = cycle[(idx + step) mod L]

# Compute final positions and invert
cows_at_pos = array[N]
for cow i in 0..N-1:
    qT = to[i]
    pT = (qT + T) mod N
    cows_at_pos[pT] = i

print cows_at_pos
```
