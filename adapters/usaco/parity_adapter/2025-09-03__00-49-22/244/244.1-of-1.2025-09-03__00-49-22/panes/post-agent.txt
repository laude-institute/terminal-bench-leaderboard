[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Perimeter [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John has arranged N hay bales (1 <= N <= 50,000) in the middle of
one of his fields.  If we think of the field as a 1,000,000 x 1,000,000
grid of 1 x 1 square cells, each hay bale occupies exactly one of these
cells (no two hay bales occupy the same cell, of course).

FJ notices that his hay bales all form one large connected region, meaning
that starting from any bale, one can reach any other bale by taking a
series of steps either north, south, east, or west onto directly adjacent
bales.  The connected region of hay bales may however contain "holes" --
empty regions that are completely surrounded by hay bales.

Please help FJ determine the perimeter of the region formed by his hay
bales.  Note that holes do not contribute to the perimeter.

PROBLEM NAME: perimeter

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of hay bales, N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the (x,y) location of a single hay
        bale, where x and y are integers both in the range
        1..1,000,000. Position (1,1) is the lower-left cell in FJ's
        field, and position (1000000,1000000) is the upper-right cell.

SAMPLE INPUT:

8
10005 200003
10005 200004
10008 200004
10005 200005
10006 200003
10007 200003
10007 200004
10006 200005

INPUT DETAILS:

The connected region consisting of hay bales looks like this:

XX
X XX
XXX

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The perimeter of the connected region of hay bales.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

14

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The length of the perimeter of the connected region is 14 (for example, the
left side of the region contributes a length of 3 to this total).  Observe
that the hole in the middle does not contribute to this number.

**Calculating perimeter of squares**

I'm tasked with determining the perimeter of the union of squares given certain coordinates. With inputs up to 50,000, even though the coordinates can be large,
 the count is relatively small. I need to focus on calculating the external perimeter, ignoring holes. One approach is to treat the grid as a bounding box and f
lood fill around it. However, the grid's size poses a challenge. A better method is to represent hay bale positions in a set, initially contributing four perime
ter units each, but subtracting for shared edges. However, I need to remember not to count hole perimeters.
**Exploring perimeter calculation methods**

I’m considering alternative approaches to compute the perimeter around bales. Instead of performing a BFS on cells, I could focus on the graph of empty cells ad
jacent to those bales, identifying which are reachable from the outside. I might explore using a flood fill specifically for holes, although that could be slow.
 A different idea is to use a line sweep for the union polygon, counting only external edges between hay cells and their neighboring empty cells. I want to cons
ider coordinate compression for efficiency while focusing only on critical areas where bales exist and grouping distant empty cells together.
**Considering perimeter calculation strategies**

I'm exploring methods to calculate the perimeter of empty regions around bales. One idea is to use run-length compression for sections without bales and use BFS
 to assess connectivity to the outside. However, there are challenges regarding efficiency, especially with large areas. A well-known trick is to calculate peri
meter using shared edges: for each cell, I can contribute 4 minus 2 for each neighbor shared. I also need to focus on the edges between bales and empty cells ou
tside, compressing coordinates to handle size constraints efficiently. Exploring boundary walking might help to manage these computations more effectively.
