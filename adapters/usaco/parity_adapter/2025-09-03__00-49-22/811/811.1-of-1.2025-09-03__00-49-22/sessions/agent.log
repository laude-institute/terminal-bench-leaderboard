Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.
Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Save your solution as solution.py
No outside libraries are allowed.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's winter on the farm, and that means snow! There are $N$ tiles on the path
from the farmhouse to the barn, conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, and tile $i$
is covered in $f_i$ feet of snow. 

Farmer John starts off on tile $1$ and must reach tile $N$ to wake up the cows.
Tile $1$ is sheltered by the farmhouse roof, and tile $N$ is sheltered by the
barn roof, so neither of these tiles has any snow. But to step on the other
tiles, Farmer John needs to wear boots!

In his foul-weather backpack, Farmer John has $B$ pairs of boots, numbered
$1 \dots B$. Some pairs are more heavy-duty than others, and some pairs are more
agile than others. In particular, pair $i$ lets FJ step in snow at most $s_i$
feet deep, and lets FJ move at most $d_i$ forward in each step.

Unfortunately, the boots are packed in such a way that Farmer John can only
access the topmost pair at any given time. So at any time, Farmer John can
either put on the topmost pair of boots (discarding his old pair) or discard the
topmost pair of boots (making a new pair of boots accessible).

Farmer John can only change boots while standing on a tile. If that tile has $f$
feet of snow, both the boots he takes off AND the boots he puts on must be able
to withstand at least $f$ feet of snow. Intermediate pairs of boots which he
discards without wearing do not need to satisfy this restriction.

Help Farmer John minimize waste, by determining the minimum number of pairs of
boots he needs to discard in order to reach the barn.  You may assume that
Farmer John is initially not wearing any boots.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $B$
($2 \leq N,B \leq 250$).

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers.  The $i$th integer is
$f_i$, giving the depth of snow on tile $i$ ($0 \leq f_i \leq 10^9$). It's
guaranteed that $f_1 = f_N = 0$.

The next $B$ lines contain two space-separated integers each. The first integer
on line $i+2$ is $s_i$, the maximum depth of snow in which pair $i$ can step.
The second integer on line $i+2$ is $d_i$, the maximum step size for pair $i$.
It's guaranteed that $0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq d_i \leq N-1$.

The boots are described in top-to-bottom order, so pair $1$ is the topmost pair
in FJ's backpack, and so forth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of a single integer, giving the minimum number of
boots Farmer John needs to discard. It's guaranteed that it will be possible for FJ to make it to the barn.

**Analyzing boot movement problem**

I’m tackling a problem involving moving across N tiles with B boots. I can only access the topmost boot in the stack. The actions involve wearing or discarding boots, ensuring they can manage the snow depth on the current tile. Starting with no boots on tile 1 is fine due to zero snow, but to move to the next tile, I need to wear a boot. I need to minimize the number of discards in the process.
**Clarifying boot discard counts**

I need to clarify how discarding boots works. The problem states that wearing a new pair automatically discards the old one. The goal is to minimize the total number of pairs tossed away, which includes both discarding without wearing and the old pair when switching. At the start, there are no discards. If I wear boot 1, that's zero discards. But once I want to switch to boot 2, I have to consider how many boots I discard along the way, which seems to involve counting some skipped boots too.
**Exploring boot discard costs**

I’m working with a weighted graph where the cost of discarding boots has to be clear, having weights assigned based on movement and equipment actions. The goal is to reach position N with the minimal number of discards. Maybe I should use dynamic programming to minimize the discards while tracking the boot index and reachable tiles. It seems that if I keep track of the maximum boot index m that I can use, the cost can be efficiently calculated as m-1, which represents tidy discards when switching boots.

**Developing Python Solution**

The user is looking for a Python 3 approach to a dynamic programming problem. First, I need to clearly restate the problem and conceptualize the solution. Then, I'll write a pseudocode before saving the final implementation as solution.py. The parameters include limits for N and B, which are both up to 250. The goal is to minimize the discards needed to reach tile N, starting from tile 1, using a stack-based boot system and tracking accessible boots.
**Clarifying Boot Discard Logic**

The user needs to account for boot usage to navigate tiles, starting with finding suitable boots for tile 1, which is manageable since all boots can handle 0 feet. I’m thinking about the dynamic programming approach, defining state dp[i][j] as the minimum discards to reach tile i while wearing boot j. Important to clarify the discard logic: discarding boots without wearing them counts, and switching out boots also counts as a discard. I’m also considering alternatives like BFS for managing the states effectively.
**Defining Boot Transition Logic**

I'm breaking down how to transition between boot states while minimizing discards. Starting from state (i, k), I recognize the importance of tracking the stack of boots. I’ll note that when moving to boot k, any previous boots must be discarded, impacting the discard count. The operations include wearing the current boot or discarding the topmost. The goal is to reach tile N with minimal discards. I realize an efficient approach will involve dynamic programming to manage the discard logic, ensuring I consider the sequence of boots worn correctly.
**Establishing Boot Reachability**

To minimize discards, it's crucial to choose the final boot as early as possible, considering that multiple swaps may be necessary. As I analyze the problem, I see that if I wear boots in increasing order, the total discards equal the index of the last boot worn minus one. This means I need to set up a dynamic programming approach to find the minimal boot index required to reach the final tile while tracking reachable segments efficiently. I'll use this logic to optimize my BFS or DP method to ensure it runs within acceptable limits.
**Drafting the Final Solution**

To finalize my solution, I should prepare a clear response. First, I need to restate the problem in English so it's easily understood. Next, I'll conceptualize the solution and lay out the pseudocode. After that, I’ll create the actual code for `solution.py` using BFS for each boot—utilizing `collections.deque` for efficient queuing and representing reachable tiles with a boolean list. Once I've drafted the code and incorporated all necessary steps, I’ll call to create the `solution.py` file and exit.

**Problem Restatement**  
Farmer John must travel from tile 1 to tile N over snow depths `f[i]`. He has a stack of `B` boots; boot i tolerates snow up to `s[i]` and can step up to `d[i]` tiles forward. He can only access boots in stack order, and switching/discarding counts toward the discard total. We need the minimum number of discarded boots for FJ to reach tile N.

**Solution Outline**  
- The total discards equals the zero-based index of the final boot worn.  
- For each boot in stack order, determine if—with all boots up to that one—FJ can eventually reach the barn.  
- Maintain an array of tiles reachable so far (`reach_tiles`).  
- For each new boot (with tolerance `s`, step `d`):  
  - Identify reachable tiles where FJ can switch into this boot (`f[tile] ≤ s`).  
  - From all such start tiles, BFS forward (only forward moves up to `d` steps, stepping only on `f ≤ s`).  
  - Mark all newly reached tiles and merge into `reach_tiles`.  
  - If tile N becomes reachable, output this boot’s index (0-based) as the discard count.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N, B
read f[0..N-1]
read boots[0..B-1] as (s, d)
reach_tiles = [False]*N; reach_tiles[0]=True

for j from 0 to B-1:
    s, d = boots[j]
    starts = [i for i if reach_tiles[i] and f[i]<=s]
    if starts empty: continue
    visited = [False]*N
    enqueue all starts in queue, mark visited
    while queue not empty:
        u = dequeue
        for v from u+1 to min(N-1, u+d):
            if not visited[v] and f[v]<=s:
                mark visited[v]; enqueue v
    merge visited into reach_tiles
    if reach_tiles[N-1]:
        print(j)
        exit
```
