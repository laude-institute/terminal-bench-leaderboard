[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Tile Exchanging [Ray Li]

Farmer John wants to remodel the floor of his barn using a collection of
square tiles he recently purchased from the local square mart store (which
of course, only sells square objects).  Unfortunately, he didn't measure
the size of the barn properly before making his purchase, so now he needs
to exchange some of his tiles for new square tiles of different sizes.

The N square tiles previously purchased by FJ have side lengths A_1...A_N.
He would like to exchange some of these with new square tiles so that the
total sum of the areas of the his tiles is exactly M.  Square mart is
currently offering a special deal: a tile of side length A_i can be
exchanged for a new tile of side length B_i for a cost of 
|A_i-B_i|*|A_i-B_i| units. However, this deal only applies to
previously-purchased tiles -- FJ is not allowed to exchange a tile that he
has already obtained via exchanging some other tile (i.e., a size-3 tile
cannot be exchanged for a size-2 tile, which is then exchanged for a size-1
tile). 

Please determine the minimum amount of money required to exchange tiles so
that the sum of the areas of the tiles becomes M.  Output -1 if it is
impossible to obtain an area of M.

square for a side-1 square.  This gives the desired area of 4+1+1=6 and
costs 4+1=5 units.

**Analyzing tile optimization**

I’m working on a combinatorial optimization problem involving tile exchanges. Given initial tiles with sides \( A_i \) where the area sums to \( \text{sum}(A_i^2) \), we aim for a final area sum of \( M \). Each \( A_i \) can be exchanged for a new side \( B_i \), incurring a cost of \( (A_i - B_i)^2 \). While \( B_i \) must be positive integers, I'm not sure if \( B_i\) could be zero because tiles must be squares. So I need to clarify that!
**Refining tile size constraints**

I think \( B_i \) should be a positive integer because a zero-sized tile can't exist in this context. If \( B_i \) were zero, it would effectively remove the tile and reduce the area, which isn't valid. So, I’ll consider \( B_i \) ranging from 1 to 100, given that it should also satisfy the conditions of area sums matching \( M \). I can use dynamic programming, treating this like a knapsack problem by minimizing costs while ensuring area constraints are met. I’ll track the area and cost effectively, generating possible area-cost pairs per tile.

1. Problem Restatement  
John has N square tiles with side lengths A₁…Aₙ (areas Aᵢ²) and wants the total area to be exactly M. He can exchange each original tile exactly once, changing its side from Aᵢ to Bᵢ at cost (Aᵢ–Bᵢ)². Find the minimum total cost to achieve total area M, or –1 if impossible.

2. Solution Concept  
Use dynamic programming over tiles and achievable area sums. For each tile, iterate possible new side lengths B from 1 up to √M. Maintain dp[s] = min cost to reach area s using processed tiles. Update dp for each tile by considering all B that keep the sum within M.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read N, M, and list A of length N
INF = large number
dp = array of size M+1, fill INF; dp[0]=0
max_side = floor(sqrt(M))
for each a in A:
    new_dp = [INF]*(M+1)
    for s from 0 to M:
        if dp[s] is INF: continue
        for b from 1 to max_side:
            area = b*b
            if s+area > M: break
            cost = dp[s] + (a-b)^2
            new_dp[s+area] = min(new_dp[s+area], cost)
    dp = new_dp
answer = dp[M] if < INF else -1
print answer
```
