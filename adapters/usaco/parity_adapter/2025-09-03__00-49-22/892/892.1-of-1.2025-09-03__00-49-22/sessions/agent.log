[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3,
\dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

The cows are a bit sleepy today, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ in the range $1 \ldots N-1$. The $k$ cows whom she passes will
amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1 
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1 
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find the minimum number of time steps required
to sort the cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers, 
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, indicating the starting order of the cows.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single integer: the number of time steps before the $N$ cows are in sorted
order, if Farmer John acts optimally.

**Understanding cow sorting**

I need to tackle a problem with cows numbered 1 to N in a certain order. Farmer John can only give instructions to the cow at the front of the line, allowing it to move down a specified number of positions. The goal is to sort the cows in ascending order. This setup resembles pancake sorting, but with a crucial difference: only the leading cow can be shifted without reversing any portion of the line. I need to figure out how to minimize the number of steps needed.
**Analyzing sorting moves**

I need to think through the steps for sorting a list of cows using specific moves. The task involves taking the first cow, letting it pop out, and then placing it back in some position based on how many cows are ahead of it. The goal is to transform the initial list into a sorted order while minimizing the moves. 

Instead of a greedy approach, I wonder if I could find the longest sorted suffix. For instance, from the state [1, 2, 4, 3], cow 1 is in front, making it easier. However, moving cow 1 away could complicate things since I’d need to bring her back. Only the first cow can move, so I must focus on how to reorder the cows efficiently to achieve the sorted output.
**Examining sorting moves**

I’m analyzing the movements of cows to sort them efficiently. By taking the first cow and placing it in a new position, I need to minimize the number of moves to achieve a sorted line. If the initial permutation is already sorted, no moves are required.

To optimize, I should look for the longest contiguous suffix of the target sequence that matches the original position. This leads me to consider how many breaks exist in the sequence of numbers as I iterate through the cows, keeping track of those that are already correctly sequenced. It seems this approach may help find the best strategy.
**Analyzing cow sorting moves**

I’m trying to work out how to reorder the cows using minimal operations. The goal is to sort them into the order [1, 2, …, N]. The process involves repeatedly taking the front cow and reinserting it in a new position. I think a common approach would be to find the longest sorted suffix at the end of the current lineup, indicating which cows don’t need to be moved. Each operation involves moving the first cow and can break the order of other cows, so I should focus on optimizing where the front cow is inserted to maintain overall order. 

I need to identify how many operations are necessary based on the longest contiguously correct suffix found.
**Conceptualizing sorting moves**

I need to determine how many moves are necessary to sort the cows into the order [1, 2, …, N]. It seems that I’ve established a method to find the longest sorted suffix of cows at the end of the list. The result will indicate how many cows need moving. Specifically, the number of moves corresponds to the initial position of the first cow that interrupts the increasing order of this suffix.

Now I want to create a solution file that implements this logic and gives the correct output based on given inputs.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restatement  
   - You have N cows in a line (permutation p1…pN).  
   - Only the cow at the front can move back k spots (1≤k≤N−1), shifting the others forward.  
   - Stop once the line is 1,2,…,N and count moves.  

2. Conceptual Solution  
   - Any strictly increasing suffix (from the end) is already in correct relative order and never needs to move.  
   - Only cows before that suffix need to be moved, one per step.  
   - So find the first index i (from left, 0-based) where p[i…N−1] becomes strictly increasing; the answer is i.  

3. Pseudocode  
   - Read N and array p of length N  
   - Let i = N−1  
   - While i>0 and p[i−1]<p[i]:  
       • i -= 1  
   - Output i  

4. Implementation  
   - Saved as `solution.py` in the workspace. You can run it with `python3 solution.py`.
