[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But lo and behold, some entries of his log are
missing!

Farmer John is confident that the he started his log on the day of a breakout.
Please help him determine, out of all sequences of events consistent with the
log entries that remain, the minimum and maximum number of breakouts that may
have take place over the course of the logged time.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is
either $-1$, indicating that the log entry for day $i$ is missing, or a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the counter
was at
$a_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
If there is no sequence of events consistent with Farmer John's partial log and
his knowledge that the cows definitely broke out of the barn on the morning of
day $1$, output a single integer $-1$.  Otherwise, output two space-separated
integers $m$ followed by $M$, where $m$ is the minimum number of breakouts of
any consistent sequence of events, and $M$ is the maximum.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
-1 -1 -1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2 3

In this example, we can deduce that a breakout had to occur on day 3.  Knowing
that  a breakout also occurred on day 1, the only remaining bit of uncertainty
is whether a breakout occurred on day 2.  Hence, there were between 2 and 3
breakouts in total.

**Conceptualizing Python solution**

The user is looking for a solution that involves restating the problem, conceptualizing a solution, writing pseudocode, and finally creating a file named soluti
on.py. They specified that no external libraries should be used, so I’ll stick to pure Python.

The problem involves tracking breakout days based on an array. If the log entries are inconsistent, there may be no solution. I need to model this with dynamic
programming or a greedy approach, focusing on the minimum and maximum breakouts.
**Analyzing breakout counters**

I’m observing that for each day, the counter reflects the days since the last breakout. If the last breakout was on day j, then the counter for day i would be i
 - j if there were no breakouts in between. I need to set up a dynamic programming approach to track the last breakout and count breakouts, ultimately finding t
he minimum and maximum for day N.

I’ll define states in my DP representation to manage the transitions based on whether a breakout occurs or not, ensuring to check known entries along the way. T
his approach could lead to a manageable complexity, so I’ll keep refining it!
**Restating and conceptualizing solution**

I'm working on a task that involves finding the minimum and maximum number of breakouts over N days, based on partial log entries. The solution involves dynamic
 programming to track the last breakout day and understand its relation to the known entries.

I'll frame the problem in pseudocode to clarify the approach, ensuring the first day is always a breakout. Later, I'll save the final implementation in a file n
amed solution.py once I have everything laid out clearly. Let's see how to format this succinctly!

Here’s a Python 3 solution using dynamic programming to track the last breakout day and compute the minimum and maximum breakouts consistent with the partial lo
g. The implementation is saved in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or add further explanation!
