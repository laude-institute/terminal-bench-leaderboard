ng at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please

cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('"'"'s and )'"'"'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('"'"'s as )'"'"'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Balanced Cow Breeds [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John usually brands his cows with a circular mark, but his branding
iron is broken, so he instead must settle for branding each cow with a mark
in the shape of a parenthesis -- (.  He has two breeds of cows on his farm:
Holsteins and Guernseys.  He brands each of his cows with a
parenthesis-shaped mark.  Depending on which direction the cow is facing,
this might look like either a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis.

FJ's N cows are all standing in a row, each facing an arbitrary direction,
so the marks on the cows look like a string of parentheses of length N.
Looking at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please
help FJ compute the number of possible ways he could assign breeds to his N
cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

**Implementing Balanced Cow Breeds**

I’m working on the "Balanced Cow Breeds" problem, which involves assigning each character in a parentheses string to either H or G breed while maintaining balan
ced parentheses for both subsequences. The steps I’ll follow include restating the problem, outlining a conceptual solution, writing pseudocode, and saving the
final solution as a Python script without using outside libraries. I’ll be using dynamic programming for this, defining a state to count valid configurations ba
sed on subsequence balances.
**Implementing Dynamic Programming Approach**

I’m working on a dynamic programming strategy for this problem, focusing on the complexity being O(N²). I’ll set up base conditions with dp[0][0] = 1 and b(0) =
 0. As I iterate through the characters, I can track the balance of parentheses using two arrays for the previous and current states. Each iteration will check
character assignments for H or G while ensuring that balances remain valid. I need to maintain and update balance while processing the characters effectively.
**Formulating Balanced Cow Breeds Code**

I'm outlining the steps to implement the "Balanced Cow Breeds" problem in Python. I’ll start by restating the problem: Farmer John has a parentheses string and
needs to count assignments of each character to either H or G so that both subsequences are balanced.

Next, I'll describe the conceptual solution, which utilizes dynamic programming to track balances. I’ll provide pseudocode that illustrates the process. Finally
, I’ll prepare to apply the code patch for the solution and ensure clarity by including comments in the code. Let's go ahead and create the final solution file.

1. Restatement
   - Given a parentheses string S of length N, count assignments of each position to breed H or G so that, when we extract H’s parentheses in order and G’s in o
rder, each subsequence is a balanced parentheses string.

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Use dynamic programming over prefixes: track the current “balance” (opens minus closes) for Holsteins (`h`). Because the overall prefix balance `b` is know
n, Guernsey’s balance is `b − h`. At each character, assign it to H or G and update balances, rejecting moves that go negative. Finally, count ways ending with
both balances zero.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read S
   N = len(S)
   MOD = 2012
   dp_prev = array[0..N] of 0
   dp_prev[0] = 1
   balance = 0
   for each c in S:
       dp_curr = zeros[0..N]
       if c == '(':
           for h in 0..balance:
               v = dp_prev[h]
               dp_curr[h+1] += v       # H gets '('
               dp_curr[h]   += v       # G gets '('
           balance += 1
       else:  # c == ')'
           for h in 0..balance:
               v = dp_prev[h]
               if h >= 1:
                   dp_curr[h-1] += v   # H gets ')'
               if balance - h >= 1:
                   dp_curr[h]   += v   # G gets ')'
           balance -= 1
       dp_prev = dp_curr mod MOD
   answer = dp_prev[0] mod MOD
   print(answer)
   ```

4. The solution is saved in `solution.py`.
