[?2004lmer John'"'"'s cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ'"'"'s
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ'"'"'s route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Roadblock [Brian Dean]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25,000), each with an associated length. 
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

**Considering graph optimization**

I need to implement a solution in Python 3 for a problem involving a weighted undirected graph. The goal is to determine how much the shortest path from node 1 to node N increases if I double the weight of one edge—specifically the edge that causes the maximum increase. The constraints make it clear that my brute force approach of running Dijkstra's algorithm multiple times will be too slow, so I’ll need to find a way to optimize this process.
**Refining the shortest path approach**

I’m thinking about whether to focus only on edges in the initial shortest path tree from node 1 to N. However, it's crucial to also consider edges that might not be on that path because changing their weights could force a detour. My plan is to calculate the shortest distances from the source and destination by running Dijkstra twice. The original path length is identified as D. If an edge isn't part of the shortest path, doubling it won't affect the path length. I need to ensure I explore paths that include this doubled edge, considering the various routes possible.
**Optimizing the shortest path calculation**

I’m considering how the shortest path is determined by various edges and their weights. The goal is to find the maximum increase in path length when doubling one edge. If an edge is part of every shortest route, doubling it will definitely increase the distance. However, if only part of the shortest paths, another route may still exist that remains unchanged. To simplify, I’ll focus on one specific shortest path and double its edges to see the effect, running Dijkstra to reconstruct and assess this path's impact.

1. Restated problem:
We have an undirected graph of N fields connected by M weighted bidirectional paths. Farmer John travels along the shortest path from field 1 to field N. The cows can double the length of exactly one path and want to maximize how much that increases the shortest-path distance. Compute that maximum increase.

2. Conceptual solution:
- Run Dijkstra once to find the base shortest path from 1 to N and record one sequence of edges on that route.
- For each edge along this path, temporarily double its weight, rerun Dijkstra, and measure the new shortest-path length.
- The largest difference from the original distance is the answer.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read N, M
build adjacency list with edge indices and weights array
(dist, parent) = dijkstra(no edge doubled)
original = dist[N]
reconstruct one shortest path by following parent pointers from N back to 1,
  collecting edge indices
max_increase = 0
for each edge_idx in path:
  (dist2, _) = dijkstra(doubling edge_idx)
  increase = dist2[N] - original
  max_increase = max(max_increase, increase)
print(max_increase)
```
