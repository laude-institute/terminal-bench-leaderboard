[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($N \leq 3 \times 10^5)$ have heights $1, 2, \ldots, N$.  One day, the cows are
standing in a line in some order playing frisbee; let $h_1 \ldots h_N$ denote
the heights of the cows in this order (so the $h$'s are a permutation of
$1 \ldots N$).

Two cows at positions $i$ and $j$ in the line can successfully throw the frisbee
back and forth if and only if every cow between them has height lower than
$\min(h_i, h_j)$.

Please compute the sum of distances between all pairs of locations $i<j$ at
which there resides a pair of cows that can successfully throw the frisbee  back
and forth.  The distance between locations $i$ and $j$ is $j-i+1$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$. The next line of input
contains $h_1 \ldots h_N$, separated by spaces.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the sum of distances of all pairs of locations at which there  are cows
that can throw the frisbee back and forth.  Note that the large  size of
integers involved in this problem may require the use of 64-bit integer data
types (e.g., a "long long" in C/C++).

SAMPLE INPUT:
7

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

The pairs of successful locations in this example are as follows:


(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)

SCORING
Test cases 1-3 satisfy $N\le 5000$.Test cases 4-11 satisfy no
additional constraints.

**Analyzing the Frisbee Problem**

I’m tackling a standard problem from USACO, possibly at the silver or gold level. The challenge is about counting visible distances in a skyline by calculating
scores through distances of pairs (i, j) that can see each other. I need to maintain a monotonic decreasing stack for cow heights, popping elements to calculate
 visibility. Each time I consider a new position, I'll check the stack to count visible pairs while adjusting for distances — it’s all about associating heights
 with their respective indices effectively.
**Clarifying the Pair Counting Algorithm**

I need to ensure that if the stack is not empty after popping, I check the heights carefully. Since all heights are unique, I don’t have to worry about equal he
ights. For each popped height, I add the distance to the answer. I'm confirming that the algorithm counts each pair only once. As I simulate with an example dat
aset, I’ll illustrate how pairs form as I process indices, following the stack and using the distances correctly. It’s a careful matching process.
**Finalizing the Solution Implementation**

I've summed the distances: it adds up to 24, confirming the algorithm works! Now, I’ll restate the problem: I need to count the sum of j-i+1 for all visible pai
rs using a monotonic decreasing stack. The time complexity is O(N). I’m ready to implement this in Python with straightforward input reading via sys.stdin. The
pseudocode is clear, and I’ll create a file named solution.py to save it. My final approach is to outline the problem, the conceptual solution, and then impleme
nt the code. Testing can follow, but I think we are good to proceed!

**Evaluating algorithm structure**

I'm processing stack operations with pairs and distances. I popped values to calculate distances, confirming the total counts of pairs like (4,5) and (5,6), whi
ch total nine. The distance sums matched at 24.

I need to restate and conceptualize for pseudocode, then code. I’ll use a 0-indexed Python list for height values and derive distances based on indices. Each it
eration will manage stack operations to capture indices effectively. The entire process runs in linear time, which is efficient.
**Creating solution file**

I’m getting ready to print the final answer by reading the input and calculating the answer. First, I’ll restate the problem: given a permutation from 1 to N, I
 need to count the sum of distances of all pairs where elements between them are smaller than the minimum height.

Next, I’ll conceptualize a monotonic decreasing stack approach, and I’ll formulate my pseudocode. After that, I'll create and save the code into a file named so
lution.py.

For clarity, my final message should include:

1. Problem restatement
2. Conceptualization
3. Pseudocode
4. The creation of solution.py

Then I’ll execute the code to create the solution file.

**Planning a Python solution**

I'm preparing to implement a Python solution for the user’s request. First, I'll restate the problem: we need to count pairs of indices \(i < j\) such that the
maximum height between them is less than the minimum of the two heights at those indices. This means that no cow in between can be taller than or equal to the m
inimum height of the two.

Then, I'll outline the conceptual solution and write the pseudocode, followed by creating a `solution.py` file with the final code. The approach involves using
a monotonic stack to efficiently identify the next and previous taller cows.
**Calculating visible pairs**

I'm refining my plan for counting pairs of cows based on visibility. For every valid pair \( (i, j) \), I need to add the distance \( (j - i + 1) \). I'm consid
ering pairs in the visibility graph where cows can see each other, like tossing a frisbee back and forth.

The approach uses a monotonic stack to keep track of cow heights. I'll iterate through each height, popping from the stack when the current height is taller, fo
rming pairs while calculating the distances. I’ll ensure I carefully account for these distances in the final total.

**Problem Restatement**
We have \(N\) cows, each with a unique height from 1 to \(N\), standing in a line in some permutation. Two cows at positions \(i<j\) can throw a frisbee if ever
y cow between them is shorter than both of them. We need the sum of the distances \((j - i + 1)\) over all such valid pairs.

**Solution Overview**
- Traverse the line once, keeping a monotonic decreasing stack of cows `(height, position)`.
- When the current cow is taller than the stack top, we pop the shorter cow(s). Each popped cow forms a valid pair with the current cow; add its distance.
- After popping all shorter cows, if the stack isn’t empty, the current cow can see the next taller cow on the stack; add that distance.
- Push the current cow onto the stack and continue.
- This runs in \(O(N)\) time and \(O(N)\) space.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array h[1..N]
stack ← empty
total ← 0
for i from 1 to N:
    while stack not empty and stack.top.height < h[i]:
        pop (h_j, j) from stack
        total += (i - j + 1)
    if stack not empty:
        total += (i - stack.top.position + 1)
    push (h[i], i) onto stack
print total
```
