Problem 2: Wifi Setup [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 2000) are all standing at various positions

as a one-dimensional number line.  Since his cows like to stay in email
contact with each-other, FJ wants to install Wifi base stations at various
positions so that all of the cows have wireless coverage.

After shopping around, FJ learns that the cost of a Wifi base station
depends on distance it can transmit: a base station of power r costs A +
B*r, where A is a fixed cost for installing the base station and B is a
cost per unit of transmission distance.  If FJ installs such a device at
position x, then it can transmit data to any cow located in the range x-r
... x+r.  A base station with transmission power of r=0 is allowed, but
this only provides coverage to a cow located at the same position as the

Given the values of A and B, as well as the locations of FJ's cows, please
determine the least expensive way FJ can provide wireless coverage for all
his cows.

**Analyzing base station placement**

I need to solve the problem of placing base stations to cover N cows on a 1D line. The goal is to minimize costs while ensuring all cows are covered. I see it's a dynamic programming or clustering problem involving partitions. I'll cover cows in segments, determining the best station position to minimize cost. Choosing the midpoint of cow positions within a segment seems optimal. I also plan to sort the cow positions and establish my DP definition with a base case. This setup looks promising!
**Planning the dynamic programming solution**

I’m detailing a problem involving the placement of base stations to cover cows along a line and using dynamic programming for an optimal cost solution. The recurrence relation suggests calculating the minimum cost efficiently, even with N up to 2000. I’ll read inputs, organize cow positions, initialize a DP array, and implement the logic. I also need to ensure floats are properly handled and output results formatted correctly. Finally, I’ll create a script that includes all these steps and meets the requirements efficiently!
**Detailing the solution approach**

I'm preparing my final answer for placing Wi-Fi stations to cover N cows on a line at minimum cost. First, I'll restate the problem clearly: I need to sort cows' positions and partition them optimally, placing stations at midpoint distances. Then I'll write pseudocode outlining my dynamic programming approach. I’ll create a Python script that implements the logic effectively, handling costs as floats. Finally, I’ll ensure everything is correctly formatted and apply the patch to save the code!

1. Restate: Given N cow positions on a line, install any number of WiFi stations (each costing A + B*r for radius r) so every cow lies within some station’s range, minimizing total cost.

2. Concept: Sort cow positions. Any group of consecutive cows [j..i] can be covered by one station at their midpoint with radius = (x[i]−x[j])/2, costing A + B*((x[i]−x[j])/2). Use DP where dp[i] is the min cost covering the first i cows; dp[i]=min over j≤i of dp[j−1] + cost(j..i).

3. Pseudocode:
```
read N, A, B
read and sort xs[1..N]
dp[0]=0
for i=1..N:
  dp[i]=infinity
  for j=1..i:
    span = xs[i] - xs[j]
    cost = dp[j-1] + A + B*(span/2)
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost)
print dp[N]
```
