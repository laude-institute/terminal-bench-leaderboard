[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  does
find the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.  

She is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.
The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \leq N
\leq 262,144$), each in the range $1 \ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessie
can take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a
single number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two
adjacent 7s with an 8). The goal is to maximize the value of the
largest number present in the sequence at the end of the game.  Please
help Bessie score as highly as possible!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the next $N$ lines give the sequence
of $N$ numbers at the start of the game.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1

1
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to
obtain the sequence 1 2 2, and then she merges the 2s into a 3.  Note that it is
not optimal to join the first two 1s.

**Exploring number merging**

I’m working with an array of integers, where I can merge adjacent equal numbers to maximize the largest number. This has constraints—up to 262k elements, with values up to 40—so efficiency is key. Classic merging games like 2048 come to mind. I think a greedy stack approach could work well here: I’ll scan through the sequence, maintaining a stack, merging numbers as I go to maximize the end result. The dynamic programming approach seems less feasible due to the constraints.
**Analyzing merge strategy**

I’m exploring a strategy for maximizing the largest number in an array through greedy merging, but it seems the approach might not be globally optimal. Although the greedy stack method seems effective at first glance, processing cases like [1, 1, 1, 2] reveals that it can miss merging opportunities for a better outcome. I realize this aligns with a known dynamic programming problem where I should check possible max values for each segment of the array. It may involve testing binary search on achievable values, determining if adjacent segments can optimize to the desired max.
**Developing segment merging strategy**

I’m thinking about how to approach collapsing segments in a sequence to maximize the largest value. The idea is to use dynamic programming, focusing on segments instead of individual values. I’ll start by initializing segments for each element, then merge adjacent segments with the same value, tracking the global maximum. However, I realize the greedy merging approach isn't optimal, which means I'll need to refine my merging strategy. I can implement segment transitions efficiently while managing memory so I don't exceed constraint limits. This should help calculate possible merges to find the highest value achievable.
**Finalizing dynamic programming approach**

I’m refining the merging algorithm using dynamic programming to track segments efficiently. I’ll set up an array indicating where segments can collapse to specific values. Initially, I’ll build from existing values while considering merges, then check for both direct matches and merges iteratively. This should help maximize the possible value achieved. Managing memory seems feasible, and I’m optimizing the inner loops for better performance. Now, I’ll start implementing the pseudocode into an actual solution. Let's get that working!

**Problem Restatement**  
We have a list of N numbers. In one move, you may replace two equal adjacent numbers x by a single number x+1. Repeatedly perform such merges in any order to make the largest possible number appear. Report that maximum value.

**Solution Outline**  
- We want to know, for each target value v, whether any contiguous subarray can fully collapse to exactly v.  
- Let dp_v[i] = the right-end index if the subarray starting at i can collapse to v, or –1 if it cannot.  
- **Base case (v=1):** dp₁[i]=i if a[i]==1, else –1.  
- **Transition (v>1):** dp_v[i] is valid if either  
  1. a[i]==v (it’s already a single,v-segment), or  
  2. dp_{v–1}[i]=m≥i and m+1<N and dp_{v–1}[m+1]=r≥m+1; then dp_v[i]=r.  
- We compute v=1,2,3… until no new dp_v has any valid entries. Track the largest v seen.  
- Complexity: O(V·N) with V≈max initial + log N ≲60, N≤262 144 → ~15 million checks, fast in CPython.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N
read array a[0..N-1]
max_ans = max(a)
# dp for v=1
prev = [-1]*N
for i in 0..N-1:
  if a[i]==1: prev[i]=i

# try merges for v=2,3,...
for v from 2 upward:
  curr = [-1]*N
  any_valid = false
  for i in 0..N-1:
    if a[i]==v:
      curr[i]=i
      any_valid = true
    else:
      m = prev[i]
      if m!=-1 and m+1<N and prev[m+1]!=-1:
        curr[i]=prev[m+1]
        any_valid = true
  if not any_valid:
    break
  max_ans = max(max_ans, v)
  prev = curr

print max_ans
```

    prev = [-1] * n
    for i, val in enumerate(a):
        if val == 1:
            prev[i] = i

    # try merging up to higher values
    # upper bound on v: max_ans + log2(n) ≲ 60
    for v in range(2, max_ans + 60):
        curr = [-1] * n
