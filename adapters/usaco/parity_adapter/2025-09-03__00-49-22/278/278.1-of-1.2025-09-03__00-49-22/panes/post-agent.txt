[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bovine Ballet [Brian Dean, 2013]

In an attempt to challenge the stereotypical perception of cows as awkward
creatures, Farmer John's prize cow Bessie has signed up for an introductory
ballet class.  Her final performance is next week, and FJ wants to help her
by building a rectangular stage large enough so that she can perform her
entire dance without falling off the edges.

Bessie's dance will take place on a rectangular stage consisting of a grid
of 1 x 1 square cells.  Bessie's four feet are described concisely as follows:

FR: Front right foot
FL: Front left foot
RR: Rear right foot
RL: Rear left foot

Her four feet start out in 4 adjacent cells forming a square as follows,
with Bessie facing north.

FL FR
RL RR

Bessie's dance follows a series of N instructions (1 <= N <= 1000), where
each instruction tells her to either move one foot by one cell or to pivot
90 degrees clockwise.

Instructions to move a foot consist of 3 characters, the first two
identifying the foot to move, and the final character specifying the
direction of movement (F = forward, B = back, R = right, L = left).  For
example, "FRF" means Bessie should move her front right foot forward one
cell, and "RLR" means she should move her rear left foot right one cell.
Of course, the direction of movement is relative to the direction Bessie is
facing.

Instruction to pivot are also 3 characters, the first two specifying the
single foot that Bessie keeps planted, around which she rotates 90 degrees
clockwise.  The last character is "P" (for pivot).  For example, the
instruction "FRP" means Bessie should pivot 90 degrees clockwise about her
stationary front right foot.  This means that if her feet are currently
situated as follows (with Bessie facing north)

.. .. ..
.. .. FR
.. FL ..
.. RL RR

then the after the instruction "FRP" her feet will be located as follows,
with Bessie now facing east:

RL FL ..
RR .. FR
.. .. ..
.. .. ..

Given the N instructions in Bessie's dance, please compute the minimum area
of a rectangular stage necessary contain her feet during the entire dance.

If Bessie clumsily ever moves one foot onto the same cell as another foot,
she will trip and fail to complete the dance; in this case, please output
-1.  Note that this is the only case where Bessie will trip; she has become
quite flexible after all her practice, and can easily move her feet into
rather strange configurations (for example, with her back feet farther
forward than her front feet).

PROBLEM NAME: ballet

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the 3-character instructions
        in Bessie's dance.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
FRF
FRP
RLB

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie's dance consists of the instructions "front right foot forward",
"front right foot pivot", and "rear left foot back".

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum area of a rectangular stage necessary to contain
        Bessie's feet during the entire dance, or -1 if Bessie trips.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

16

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie needs a 4 x 4 stage to complete her dance.  Her feet move as follows:

.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. (facing north)
.. .. FL FR
.. .. RL RR

After FRF:

.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. FR (facing north)
.. .. FL ..
.. .. RL RR

After FRP:

.. RL FL ..
.. RR .. FR (facing east)
.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. ..

After RLB:

RL .. FL ..
.. RR .. FR (facing east)
.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. ..

**Planning Bovine Ballet Solution**

I'm focusing on creating a Python solution for the Bovine Ballet problem. First, I'll need to restate the problem clearly in plain English to ensure understandi
ng. Then, I’ll conceptualize how to solve it simply. Following that, I plan to outline the solution using pseudocode. Finally, I’ll save everything into a `solu
tion.py` file.

To tackle this, I'll track the four feet's (x,y) positions on an infinite grid and their orientations. As I process steps, I’ll calculate movements based on the
 current orientation for each foot.
**Preparing Bovine Ballet Solution**

I want to finalize the Bovine Ballet solution by breaking it into clear steps. I’ll present the written explanation for steps one through three and add a note t
hat I’m saving the code in `solution.py`. I’ll ensure there's a robust implementation that reads input and processes movements without external libraries.

I’ll define how to track foot positions on a grid, starting with their placements and orientations. The mapping for directions based on orientation is essential
, especially ensuring the coordinate system is clear. I'll carefully set the initial positions for each foot and ensure my rotation formulas are correct for the
 movement logic.
**Refining Directional Vectors**

I want to simplify the directional vectors based on orientation. For orientation 0, I've defined forward as (0,1), right as (1,0), back as (0,-1), and left as (
-1,0). I can rotate these vectors for other orientations using a rotation formula.

I’d set up a mapping of direction vectors using a list of dictionaries for easy access based on the current orientation. I’ll hardcode these mappings for all fo
ur orientations and structure the movement, including pivoting calculations. I’ll ensure the necessary bounds updates are handled after each move. Finally, I’m
ready to write the solution in `solution.py`.

1. **Restated Problem**
Track Bessie’s four feet on an infinite grid as she follows up to 1000 move or pivot instructions (relative to her current facing direction). After each step, r
ecord the occupied cells; if any two feet collide, output -1. Otherwise, find the minimal rectangle covering all visited cells (by any foot at any time) and out
put its area.

2. **Solution Concept**
- Represent each foot’s (x,y) coordinates and Bessie’s orientation (0=north,…,3=west).
- For a “move” instruction, translate the specified foot by one cell using a precomputed mapping of direction vectors for each orientation.
- For a “pivot” instruction, rotate the other three feet 90° clockwise around the planted foot (using the rotation `(dx,dy)->(dy,-dx)`) and advance the orientat
ion.
- After each instruction, check for collisions. Meanwhile maintain running min/max of x and y over all feet positions at every step.
- Finally compute `(max_x - min_x + 1)*(max_y - min_y + 1)`.

3. **Pseudocode**

```
read N
read instructions list
initialize pos = {FR:(1,1), FL:(0,1), RR:(1,0), RL:(0,0)}
ori = 0
initialize min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y from initial positions
for each inst in instructions:
    foot = inst[:2], act = inst[2]
    if act is 'P':
        pivot around pos[foot]:
            for each other foot:
                dx = x - px; dy = y - py
                new_dx, new_dy = (dy, -dx)
                update foot pos = (px+new_dx, py+new_dy)
        ori = (ori+1)%4
    else:
        dx,dy = dir_map[ori][act]
        pos[foot] = (pos[foot].x+dx, pos[foot].y+dy)
    if any two pos equal:
        print(-1); exit
    update min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y with all pos
width = max_x - min_x + 1
height = max_y - min_y + 1
print(width*height)
```

4. **Solution File**
The complete implementation has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
