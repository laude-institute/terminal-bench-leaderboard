[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Balanced Cow Breeds [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John usually brands his cows with a circular mark, but his branding
iron is broken, so he instead must settle for branding each cow with a mark
in the shape of a parenthesis -- (.  He has two breeds of cows on his farm:
Holsteins and Guernseys.  He brands each of his cows with a
parenthesis-shaped mark.  Depending on which direction the cow is facing,
this might look like either a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis.

FJ's N cows are all standing in a row, each facing an arbitrary direction,
so the marks on the cows look like a string of parentheses of length N.
Looking at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please
help FJ compute the number of possible ways he could assign breeds to his N
cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: bbreeds

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of length N (1 <= N <= 1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

(())

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the number of ways FJ can
        assign breeds to cows so that the Holsteins form a balanced
        subsequence of parentheses, and likewise for the Guernseys.
        Since the answer might be a very large number, please print
        the remainder of this number when divided by 2012 (i.e., print
        the number mod 2012).  Breed assignments involving only one
        breed type are valid.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The following breed assignments work:

(())
HHHH

(())
GGGG

(())
HGGH

(())
GHHG

(())
HGHG

(())
GHGH

[2025-08-24T21:33:33] thinking

**Implementing dynamic programming**

I need to tackle the classic USACO problem 2012 Balanced Cow Breeds. It involves a string S of parentheses, up to 1000 characters long, where each position is a
ssigned a breed of either H or G. The challenge is counting the assignment ways modulo 2012 while ensuring that each breed's subsequence remains balanced. I thi
nk dynamic programming is the way to go. The goal is to define a DP array capturing the balance of each breed and processing each parenthesis step by step.
**Finalizing the solution approach**

I’m working on the implementation details for the USACO problem. For the parentheses assignment, when encountering a closing parenthesis, I just check if there'
s a balance to decrement; otherwise, I skip. I need to ensure I’m managing state transitions properly in my dynamic programming table. My final answer will be s
tored with a modulo operation as specified.

The algorithm runs in O(N^2), which is acceptable given the constraints. I’ll need to structure my pseudocode and create a solution.py file containing the main
logic. With everything planned, I can move forward!
**Preparing the solution script**

I'm getting ready to implement the solution in Python, using list comprehensions for my dynamic programming arrays. I want to ensure I handle large inputs prope
rly, so I'll create an array of integers for the DP state. I'll write the necessary code while making sure to include modulo operations to keep numbers in check
.

Now, I’ll focus on reading input correctly and then create the `solution.py` file as planned. Let’s get this code finalized and ready to go!
