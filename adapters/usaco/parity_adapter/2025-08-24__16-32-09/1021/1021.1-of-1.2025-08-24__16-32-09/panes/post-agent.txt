[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's pasture can be represented by a $N\times N$  square grid
$(1\le N\le 300)$ consisting of positions $(i,j)$ for all $1\le i,j\le N$. For
each square of the grid, the corresponding character in the input is equal to
'*' if there exists a single cow at that position and '.' if there does not
exist a cow at that position.

FJ believes that the beauty of his pasture is directly proportional to the
number of triples of cows such that their positions are equidistant from each
other. In other words, they form an equilateral triangle. Unfortunately, it was
only quite recently that FJ realized that since all of his cows are located at
integer coordinates, no beautiful triples can possibly exist if Euclidean
distance is used! Thus, FJ has decided to switch to use "Manhattan" distance
instead. Formally, the Manhattan distance between two positions $(x_0,y_0)$ and
$(x_1,y_1)$ is equal to $|x_0-x_1|+|y_0-y_1|$.

Given the grid representing the positions of the cows, compute the number of
equilateral triples.

SCORING:
There will be fourteen test cases aside from the sample, one for each of
$N\in \{50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,275,300,300,300,300\}.$

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N.$

For each $1\le i\le N,$ line $i+1$ of the input contains a string of length $N$
consisting solely of the characters '*' and '.'. The $j$th character
describes whether there exists a cow at position $(i,j)$ or not.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer containing the answer. It can be shown that it fits into
a signed 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
*..
.*.
*..
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

There are three cows, and they form an equilateral triple because the Manhattan
distance between each pair of cows is equal to two.

[2025-08-24T21:26:05] thinking

**Breaking down the triangle problem**

The user wants me to restate the problem: we have an NxN grid where '*' marks cows, and we need to count triples that form an "equilateral triangle" based on Ma
nhattan distance. I need to identify triples i<j<k such that the Manhattan distance is equal among all pairs. Equilateral triangles under this metric produce di
ametric shapes, so I should analyze configurations where these distances align. I’ll explore the characteristics of these triples on an integer grid.
**Exploring triangle shapes in L1 metric**

I’m representing coordinates in the plane and considering patterns for an isosceles triangle under the L1 metric. For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be
 equal, which leads me to two shapes: either right triangles or diamond shapes. When thinking of examples, I realize the points could be organized in a way that
 matches a 60-degree orientation.

If I rotate coordinates 45 degrees and use specific transformations, the L1 metric translates into the L∞ metric, turning equilateral triangles into squares who
se sides are equal. The challenge is finding triples so that all pairwise distances meet the requirements. For equilateral triangles in L1, I’m concluding those
 conditions lead to specific configurations within the Chebyshev distance.
**Characterizing triangles in coordinates**

I'm realizing that equilateral triangles in the L1 metric correspond to specific configurations in the Chebyshev distance context, forming square-like structure
s. To find triples that meet the criteria, I can define squares based on coordinate transformations. Each square's corners lead to valid cow positions, so I nee
d to count these distinct corners and ensure they share parity, especially focusing on even side lengths for valid cow placements. The next step will be to enum
erate the valid triples efficiently by checking the range of coordinates.
**Implementing the solution**

I’m working on implementing the code provided, which reads the grid size and structure, then processes the positions of cows (marked as '*'). The logic involves
 calculating specific coordinate transformations and using a bitmask to efficiently track possible combinations of cows forming triangles. I need to calculate t
otal valid triangles of different sizes and print the result.

Next, I'll format this into a function called `apply_patch` and save it as `solution.py`. It seems like a solid approach!

I’ve added `solution.py` with a Python implementation that:

- Restates the problem via a Manhattan-to-Chebyshev mapping.
- Builds bitmasks of cow positions in transformed `(u, v)` space.
- Iterates row pairs to count all 4-corner and 3-corner squares (each corresponds to equilateral triples).
- Uses fast bitwise operations and `bit_count()` for efficiency on up to 300×300 grids.

Let me know if you’d like a walkthrough or to run a quick test!
