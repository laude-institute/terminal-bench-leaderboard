[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Beauty Pageant (Silver Level) [Brian Dean]

Hearing that the latest fashion trend was cows with three spots on their
hides, Farmer John has purchased an entire herd of three-spot cows.
Unfortunately, fashion trends tend to change quickly, and the most popular
current fashion is cows with only one spot!

FJ wants to make his herd more fashionable by painting each of his cows in
such a way that merges their three spots into one.  The hide of a cow is
represented by an N by M grid of characters like this:

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Here, each 'X' denotes part of a spot.  Two 'X's belong to the same spot if
they are vertically or horizontally adjacent (diagonally adjacent does not
count), so the figure above has exactly three spots.  All of the cows in
FJ's herd have exactly three spots.

FJ wants to use as little paint as possible to merge the three spots into
one.  In the example above, he can do this by painting only four
additional characters with 'X's (the new characters are marked with '*'s
below to make them easier to see).

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX*...XX...
.XXXX..**..XXX..
...*....XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Please help FJ determine the minimum number of new 'X's he must paint in
order to merge three spots into one large spot.

PROBLEM NAME: pageant

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M (1 <= N,M <= 50).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains a length-M string of 'X's and '.'
        specifying one row of the cow hide pattern.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6 16
................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

INPUT DETAILS:

The pattern in the input shows a cow hide with three distinct spots.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of new 'X's that must be added to the
        input pattern in order to obtain one single spot.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Four 'X's suffice to join the three spots into one.

**Calculating Steiner tree distances**

I'm working on calculating the distance from each cell to the nearest cell in different components. Then, I need to find the minimal Steiner tree that connects
these three sets on a grid. I think I might need to subtract 2 because painting could affect edge counts, but I need to make sure to handle overlaps correctly.
I’ll use BFS from all cells of a component, assigning costs based on whether a cell is empty or already has an X.
**Optimizing BFS for grid cells**

I'm analyzing movement to neighboring cells, where moving to a '.' costs +1, and moving to an 'X' has no cost. Since the weights are only 0 or 1, I can use 0-1
BFS. The grid size is manageable at 50x50, so doing this three times is fine.

Next, for each cell (r,c), I’ll sum the distances from the three components. I'll need to be careful with cells that are '.', as they’re counted three times whe
n they only need to be painted once. So, I'll subtract 2 for those cells to adjust the cost. If a meeting cell is an 'X', I won't subtract anything. Essentially
, I’ll label the components, perform the BFS, and track minimal costs before returning the final result.

1. Restated the problem
   - Given an N×M grid with exactly three connected ‘X’ spots, find the minimum number of empty cells (‘.’) to paint so that all spots become a single connected
 region (4-connectivity).

2. Conceptual solution
   - Label the three existing spot components via flood-fill.
   - For each component, run a 0-1 BFS: moving through an existing ‘X’ costs 0, through a ‘.’ costs 1 (painting). This yields three distance grids.
   - For every cell, sum its three distances; if it’s ‘.’ subtract 2 (shared painting for the meeting cell). The minimum over all cells is the answer.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read N, M and grid
   components = flood-fill to find 3 spot lists
   for each component:
       run 0-1 BFS to compute dist[c][i][j]
   ans = large
   for each cell (i,j):
       total = sum(dist[k][i][j] for k in 0..2)
       if grid[i][j]=='.': total -= 2
       ans = min(ans, total)
   print(ans)
   ```

4. Implementation saved to solution.py with the described approach.
