[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's a hot summer day out on the farm, and Farmer John is serving lemonade to
his $N$ cows! All $N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$) like lemonade,
but some of them like it more than others. In particular, cow $i$ is willing to
wait in a line behind at most $w_i$ cows to get her lemonade. Right now all $N$
cows are in the fields, but as soon as Farmer John rings his cowbell, the cows
will immediately descend upon FJ's lemonade stand. They will all arrive before
he starts serving lemonade, but no two cows will arrive at the same time.
Furthermore, when cow $i$ arrives, she will join the line if and only if there
are at most $w_i$ cows already in line.

Farmer John wants to prepare some amount of lemonade in advance, but he does not
want to be wasteful. The number of cows who join the line might depend on the
order in which they arrive. Help him find the minimum possible number of cows
who join the line.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains $N$, and the second line contains the $N$
space-separated integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_N$.  It is guaranteed that
$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$, and that $0 \leq w_i \leq 10^9$ for each cow $i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the minimum possible number of cows who might join the line, among all
possible orders in which the cows might arrive.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 400 2 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
3

In this setting, only three cows might end up in line (and this is the smallest
possible).  Suppose the cows with $w = 7$ and $w = 400$ arrive first and wait in
line.  Then the cow with $w = 1$ arrives and turns away, since 2 cows are already
in line.  The cows with $w = 2$ then arrive, one staying and one turning away.

**Outlining a Python solution**

The user needs me to create a Python 3 solution using a clear, step-by-step approach. First, I’ll restate the problem in simple terms. Then, I’ll conceptualize a solution before writing pseudocode. Finally, I’ll implement the code in `solution.py`, avoiding any external libraries. The challenge allows for a maximum of 100,000 cows and weights up to 1 billion. The key is to arrange cows with smaller weights to arrive when the line is large, minimizing the final admitted set.
**Clarifying the admission strategy**

I need to minimize the number of cows that join the line. The order of arrival helps us decide who gets in based on the current queue size. It’s like we’re trying to pick an order that minimizes total admissions. I realize that letting cows with smaller weights arrive early can lead them to accept even when the line is short, but we want them to reject instead. 

To achieve this, I think sorting the weights in ascending order makes sense, starting a count at zero. As I go through the sorted weights, if a cow's weight is greater than or equal to the count, I might choose to admit them. But since I want to minimize admissions, I could hold off on admitting cows with higher weights until the line grows. This way, those cows will see a larger line and reject, allowing for the minimum admitted set.
**Refining admission conditions**

To minimize the number of cows admitted, I want to select the k cows with the largest weights. I realize that we need the smallest weight from this group, w_k, to be at least k-1 for all cows to see the line length and accept.

As I evaluate this further, I think the critical point is ensuring that the count of cows with weights greater than or equal to k equals k itself. If I can get w_k to meet that condition, I can confirm that I can admit k cows without issues.

However, if there are duplicates at the weight w_k, they could complicate things, as they might lead to extra admissions. So, I need to ensure that f'(k) — the count of cows with weights at least k— equals k. If that condition holds, then any remaining cows would reject, successfully keeping the admitted number at k.

**Restatement**  
- We have N cows, each with a threshold wᵢ. A cow joins the lemonade line only if the current line length ≤ wᵢ when she arrives. We can choose the arrival order to minimize the total number who join.  

**Solution Idea**  
- Sort all wᵢ in descending order.  
- We try to end up with exactly k cows in line. To admit exactly k:  
  - The k-th largest w (0-indexed w[k-1]) must be ≥ k-1 (so those k can all join in sequence).  
  - Any remaining cow’s w must be < k (so they will all reject when line is length k).  
- The smallest k satisfying both conditions is the answer.  

**Pseudocode**  
```
read n
read list w of length n
sort w descending
for k in 1..n:
    if w[k-1] >= k-1 AND (k==n OR w[k] < k):
        print(k)
        exit
```
