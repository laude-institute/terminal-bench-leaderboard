Problem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean, 2011]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 100) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 10,000), each with an associated length. 
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
FJ's morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

**Evaluating roadblock solution**

I need to implement a Python solution for the "roadblock" problem, which involves finding the maximum increase in the shortest path from point 1 to N by doubling the weight of exactly one edge. The constraints are N ≤ 100 and M ≤ 10k. I need to conceptualize the solution by restating the problem and developing pseudocode, then saving my findings in a solution file. I’ll establish a baseline shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm and evaluate each edge's impact on recalc paths to find the maximum increase, though I'm concerned about the computational limits.
**Refining edge testing approach**

I realize I only need to test the edges on the original shortest path because those are the only ones that can potentially increase the path length. Doubling edges on alternative shortest paths won’t affect the chosen path if they aren’t used. Even if there are multiple shortest paths, the chosen path is still unique unless there’s an equal length, in which case any can be used. My goal is to temporarily double each edge on the determined path between 1 and N, rerun the Dijkstra algorithm, and compute the new distances, ensuring efficiency throughout the process.
**Structuring the algorithm**

I need to build an algorithm for this problem that starts with creating an adjacency list, running Dijkstra’s algorithm while tracking predecessors, and saving the edges in the path. For each edge in the path, I'll double its weight in the adjacency list and rerun Dijkstra, tracking the distance increase. After that, I'd want to revert the weights and record the maximum increase.

The solution will involve reading input, building the graph, using a list of edges for doubling, and storing necessary data for reconstructing the path. I’ll ensure everything is clear, starting with a plain English explanation, followed by the conceptual solution, pseudocode, and finally presenting the contents of the solution file.

**Problem Restatement**  
We have up to 100 fields (nodes) and up to 10,000 bidirectional paths (edges) with positive lengths. FJ walks along the shortest path from field 1 to field N. The cows may pick exactly one path and double its length, trying to maximally increase FJ’s shortest‐path distance. Compute that maximum increase.

**Solution Concept**  
- Compute the original shortest distance from 1 to N with Dijkstra, recording the actual path (via predecessors).  
- Only edges on that chosen shortest path can affect FJ’s route when doubled, so extract those edge IDs.  
- For each edge on this path, temporarily double its weight, rerun Dijkstra, measure the new 1→N distance, then restore the weight.  
- Track the maximum difference between the new and original distances.  

This takes one Dijkstra to find the path, then ≤ N−1 additional Dijkstras (≤ 99), which is efficient.

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N, M
edges = []         # list of (u, v, weight)
adj = [ [] for _ in range(N+1) ]  # adjacency: (neighbor, edge_id)
for id in range(M):

    edges.append(w)

            if dist[v] > d + w:
                dist[v] = d + w
                prev[v] = (u, eid)
