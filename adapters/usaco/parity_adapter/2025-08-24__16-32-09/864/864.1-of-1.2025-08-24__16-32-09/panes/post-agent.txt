[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In order to save money for a new stall in her barn, Bessie the cow
has started performing in the local circus, demonstrating her remarkable
sense of balance as she carefully walks back and forth on an elevated
balance beam!

The amount of money Bessie earns in her performance is
related to where she manages to ultimately jump off the beam.
The beam has positions labeled $0, 1, \ldots, N+1$ from left to right.
If Bessie ever reaches $0$ or $N+1$ she falls off one of the ends
of the beam and sadly gets no payment.

If Bessie is at a given position $k$, she can do either of the following:

1. Flip a coin.  If she sees tails, she goes to position $k-1$, and if she
sees heads, she goes to position $k + 1$ (i.e. $\frac{1}{2}$ probability of either occurrence).

2. Jump off the beam and receive payment of $f(k)$ $(0 \leq f(k) \leq 10^9)$.

Bessie realizes that she may not be able to guarantee any particular
payment outcome, since her movement is governed by random coin flips.
However, based on the location where she starts, she wants to determine what her
expected payment will be if she makes an optimal sequence of decisions ("optimal"
meaning that the decisions lead to the highest possible expected payment).
For example, if her strategy earns her payment of $10$ with probability $1/2$,
$8$ with probability $1/4$, or $0$ with probability $1/4$, then her expected
payment will be the weighted average $10(1/2) + 8(1/4) + 0(1/4) = 7$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$).  Each of the
remaining $N$ lines contain $f(1) \ldots f(N)$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output $N$ lines.  On line $i$, print out $10^5$ times the expected value of
payment if Bessie starts at position $i$ and plays optimally, rounded down to
the nearest integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
1
3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
150000
300000

[2025-08-24T21:38:10] thinking

**Building the upper hull**

I'm focusing on constructing the upper hull while ensuring that it remains convex downward. To do this, I'll use the cross product method to check the orientati
on of points. When traversing the sorted points, if the cross product indicates a non-negative value (i.e., the angle is less than or equal to zero), I'll pop t
he last point from the hull. As I work through the y-coordinates being zero at the endpoints, I need to ensure proper sorting by x and y before building the hul
l.
**Implementing the upper hull**

I want to test for convexity using the cross product, ensuring the middle point forms a right turn or straight line for the upper hull. An example illustrates t
his nicely: starting with an empty hull and processing the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,3), and (3,0). If the cross product is greater than or equal to zero, I pop t
he point, but if it’s less, I keep it. This way, the correct upper hull builds up when I account for segments and interpolate values correctly while adhering to
 performance requirements. I'll write all this in a structured manner.
**Creating the solution outline**

I need to prepare a solution in plain English that includes a restatement of the problem, a conceptual explanation, and pseudocode, followed by saving the code
as solution.py.

I’ll create the code to handle the input, build the points, and compute the upper hull using the monotone chain method. The plan will include reading data, proc
essing segments, and ensuring efficiency with a complexity of about O(N). After drafting the code, I’ll apply the patch to save everything as solution.py. Let's
 get this organized!

**Problem Restatement**
Bessie starts at position \(i\) on a beam labeled \(0\) through \(N+1\). She can either stop and take a reward \(f(i)\) or flip a fair coin to move to \(i-1\) o
r \(i+1\). Falling off at 0 or \(N+1\) gives reward 0. We want, for each start \(i\in[1,N]\), the maximum expected reward assuming she stops optimally. Output \
(\lfloor 10^5 \times E[i]\rfloor\).

**Conceptual Solution**
- The value function \(E[i]\) must satisfy \(E[i]=\max\bigl(f(i),\tfrac12(E[i-1]+E[i+1])\bigr)\) with \(E[0]=E[N+1]=0\).
- The minimal function \(g\) dominating \(f\) and satisfying the “superharmonic” property \(g(i)\ge\frac{g(i-1)+g(i+1)}2\) is the *smallest concave majorant* of
 the points \((i,f(i))\), plus endpoints \((0,0)\), \((N+1,0)\).
- Compute the upper convex hull of \((0,0),(1,f(1)),\dots,(N,f(N)),(N+1,0)\).
- Between hull vertices \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2)\), linearly interpolate so that for each integer \(x\in[x_1,x_2]\):
  \[
    g(x)=y_1 + \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1).
  \]
- Multiply by \(10^5\) and floor.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read f[1..N]; set f[0]=f[N+1]=0
pts = [(i, f[i]) for i=0..N+1]
hull = empty list
for p in pts in increasing x:
    while hull has ≥2 points and cross(hull[-2],hull[-1],p) ≥ 0:
        pop last point from hull
    append p to hull
res[1..N] = 0
for each consecutive pair (x1,y1),(x2,y2) in hull:
    dx = x2-x1; dy = y2-y1
    for x from x1 to x2:
        if 1 ≤ x ≤ N:
            res[x] = y1*100000 + dy*100000*(x-x1)//dx
print res[1..N] each on its own line
```
