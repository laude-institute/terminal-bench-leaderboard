[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Wormholes [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's hobby of conducting high-energy physics experiments on
weekends has backfired, causing N wormholes (2 <= N <= 12, N even) to
materialize on his farm, each located at a distinct point on the 2D map of
his farm.

According to his calculations, Farmer John knows that his wormholes will
form N/2 connected pairs.  For example, if wormholes A and B are connected
as a pair, then any object entering wormhole A will exit wormhole B moving
in the same direction, and any object entering wormhole B will similarly
exit from wormhole A moving in the same direction.  This can have rather
unpleasant consequences.  For example, suppose there are two paired
wormholes A at (0,0) and B at (1,0), and that Bessie the cow starts from
position (1/2,0) moving in the +x direction.  Bessie will enter wormhole B,
exit from A, then enter B again, and so on, getting trapped in an infinite
cycle!

Farmer John knows the exact location of each wormhole on his farm.  He
knows that Bessie the cow always walks in the +x direction, although he
does not remember where Bessie is currently located.  Please help Farmer
John count the number of distinct pairings of the wormholes such that
Bessie could possibly get trapped in an infinite cycle if she starts from
an unlucky position.

PROBLEM NAME: wormhole

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of wormholes, N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains two space-separated integers
        describing the (x,y) coordinates of a single wormhole.  Each
        coordinate is in the range 0..1,000,000,000.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 wormholes, forming the corners of a square.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of distinct pairings of wormholes such that
        Bessie could conceivably get stuck in a cycle walking from
        some starting point in the +x direction.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If we number the wormholes 1..4, then by pairing 1 with 2 and 3 with 4,
Bessie can get stuck if she starts anywhere between (0,0) and (1,0) or
between (0,1) and (1,1).  Similarly, with the same starting points, Bessie
can get stuck in a cycle if the pairings are 1-3 and 2-4.  Only the
pairings 1-4 and 2-3 allow Bessie to walk in the +x direction from any
point in the 2D plane with no danger of cycling.

[2025-08-24T22:22:16] thinking

**Planning code implementation**

Alright, I need to find the first unpaired index and then, for any unpaired indexes greater than that, create pairs recursively. After recursion, I’ll need to u
npair and check for cycles, counting them as needed.

The user wants me to break this down into steps: restate the problem, conceptualize it, draft pseudocode, and then implement the code in Python. I’ll also ensur
e to keep everything self-contained without using external libraries. I'll start by presenting the steps in plain English before creating the solution file.
**Implementing the solution**

I need to start by reading the input value for N and then gather coordinates into a list. After that, I'll compute the `next_on_right` for each coordinate, look
ing for the minimum x values that match y coordinates.

I’ll define a function to check for cycles, and another to solve the pairings recursively. The cycle check will ensure if we encounter any cycles during the pai
ring process. I also plan to implement this in a `main()` function, being careful to use -1 for indices that don’t apply. I’ll move forward with the pseudocode
and then translate that into the actual code.
