[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie and Farmer John enjoy goat kart racing. The idea is very similar to
Go-Kart racing that others enjoy, except the karts are pulled by goats and the
track is made from nearby farmland. The farmland consists of $N$ meadows and $M$
roads, each connecting a pair of meadows.

Bessie wants to make a course from nearby farms.  A farm is a subset of two or
more meadows within which every meadow can reach every other meadow along a
unique sequence of roads.

The nearby farmland may contain multiple farms. Suppose there are $K$ farms.
Bessie would like to make a goat kart loop by connecting all $K$ farms by adding
$K$ roads of length $X$. Each farm should be visited exactly once and at least
one road must be traversed inside each farm.

To make the course interesting for racers, the total length of the track should
be at least $Y$. Bessie wants to know the sum, over all such interesting tracks,
of the total track lengths.  A track is different from another if there are two
meadows which are adjacent (after adding the roads between farms) in one track
but not the other. Please note that only the roads chosen matter, and not the
direction the goat karts will travel along those roads.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, $M$, $X$, and $Y$ where
$1 \leq N \leq 1500$, $1 \leq M \leq N-1$, and $0 \leq X, Y \leq 2500$.

Each of the $M$ following lines describe roads. The lines are of the form: $A_i$
$B_i$ $D_i$, meaning that meadows $A_i$ and $B_i$ are connected with a road of
integer length $D_i$ ($1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N$, $0 \leq D_i \leq 2500$).  Each
meadow is incident to at least one road, and there are no cycles of roads.

In at least 70% of the test cases, it is also guaranteed that $N \leq 1000$ and $Y \leq 1000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer, giving the sum of track lengths over all interesting
tracks. As the sum of track lengths can be quite large, print the sum of lengths
modulo
$10^9+7$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 1 12
1 2 3
2 3 4
4 5 6
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
54

This example has 6 possible tracks

1 --> 2 --> 4 --> 5 --> 1         (length 11)

1 --> 2 --> 5 --> 4 --> 1         (length 11)

2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 2         (length 12)

2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 4 --> 2         (length 12)

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 1   (length 15)

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 4 --> 1   (length 15)

The answer is $12+12+15+15=54$, adding up only the tracks where the length is at
least $12$.

Note that for this problem, the standard time limit is increased to 3 seconds
per test case (6 seconds per case for Java and Python).

**Clarifying count of cycles**

I'm considering how adjacency impacts the set of chosen edges, particularly for cycles on labeled nodes across K distinct trees. Each additional edge connects n
odes and leads to different adjacency sets. Even though symmetries like rotation and flip don’t matter here, I think the count involves cyclic permutations. Sti
ll, I need to keep in mind that edges and their direction can create repetitions. I’ll need to ensure I’m counting cycles while factoring in these rotations and
 reflections. Let's clear this up!
**Counting distinct cycles**

The problem states that tracks differ if one has adjacent meadows that the other lacks. For example, tracks A and B are only equal if they have identical edges.
 Cycles that are graph isomorphic can have the same edges but differ in rotation or reflection. Since nodes are labeled, we only count cycles with identical edg
e sets. Thus, we avoid overcounting cycles by considering connectivity. Each unique arrangement in connectivity should only be counted once, leading to a more c
omplicated calculation for distinct cycles while summing their lengths.
**Calculating cycle lengths**

I'm exploring cycles formed by selecting ordered pairs of distinct nodes from each tree, where orientation matters but reversals ultimately do not. Each rotatio
n or reversal preserves the edge sets. I need to sum distances across all components while ensuring not to overcount due to symmetries in component ordering. Wi
th constraints on the number of nodes and components, I plan to compute unique edge sets based on these properties. My final answer will involve directed cycles
 summed and then divided by the appropriate factors while considering modular arithmetic.
**Optimizing pair counts**

I’m analyzing the worst-case size for small pairs and realizing that the complexity per component can become too large. The challenge is to reduce the convoluti
on costs, which I’m considering an FFT approach to help manage the operations more efficiently. However, given the constraints and potential sizes of components
, I'm reevaluating how the distance distributions are managed. It seems that identifying small components early on could also help in optimizing this further, p
otentially leading to feasible dynamic programming calculations overall.
**Planning implementation steps**

I see a potential optimization: large components tend to create big distances, but when Y' is small, most distances will be greater than or equal to Y', leading
 to a smaller number of small pairs. This means my dynamic programming approach could be more efficient. I should implement the components using a visited array
 and an adjacency list, so I'm ready to move forward. I’ll organize my work into four parts: restating the problem, presenting the conceptual solution, writing
pseudocode, and finally coding the solution in solution.py.

**Problem Restatement**
We have a forest of \(N\) meadows and \(M\) edges (no cycles), forming \(K\) tree-components (“farms”). We want to build a single cycle that visits each farm ex
actly once by:
- Picking an entry and exit meadow in each farm and traversing the unique tree path between them (must use at least one internal edge).
- Adding one new edge of length \(X\) between the exit meadow of one farm and the entry meadow of the next, cyclically.

The total cycle length is the sum of all internal path lengths plus \(K\!X\). We only count “interesting” cycles whose total length \(\ge Y\). Cycles are consid
ered identical if they have the same set of undirected edges, regardless of traversal direction or starting point. We must compute the sum of lengths over all d
istinct cycles, modulo \(10^9+7\).

---

**Solution Sketch**
1. Decompose the graph into its \(K\) tree-components.
2. For each component \(t\), compute:
   - \(C_t = n_t(n_t-1)\), the number of ordered entry/exit pairs.
   - \(S_t = \sum_{u\ne v} \text{dist}(u,v)\), the total sum of distances over all ordered pairs.
   - A small-distance map of counts for distances \(d < Y' := Y - KX\).
3. Let \(P = \prod_t C_t\). The total number of ordered ways to pick all \(K\) pairs is \(P\).
4. The total sum of internal distances over all ordered choices (without any threshold) is
   \[
     B_{\text{all}}
     = P \sum_{t=1}^K \frac{S_t}{C_t}
     = P\;\Bigl(\sum_t S_t\,C_t^{-1}\Bigr)\pmod{M}.
   \]
5. If \(Y'\le0\), every cycle meets the length threshold.
   - Ways \(A=P\).
   - Sum of internal distances \(B=B_{\text{all}}\).
   Otherwise, do a knap­sack-style DP (over sums \(<Y'\)) to count:
   - \(A_{\text{small}}\): total ordered ways with \(\sum d_t <Y'\).
   - \(B_{\text{small}}\): total \(\sum d_t\) over those.
   Then
   \[
     A = P - A_{\text{small}},\quad
     B = B_{\text{all}} - B_{\text{small}}.
   \]
6. The total cycle length sum over *ordered* choices is
   \(\;K!\,\bigl(B + KX\cdot A\bigr)\).
   To account for undirected cycles (ignore rotation and reversal), divide by \(2K\):
   \[
     \text{answer}
     = \frac{K!}{2K}\,\bigl(B + KX\!A\bigr)
     = \frac{(K-1)!}{2}\,\bigl(B + KX\!A\bigr)\bmod10^9+7.
   \]

---

**Pseudocode**
```
read N,M,X,Y
build adjacency list
find components via BFS/DFS  → comps (lists of nodes)
K ← number of comps; T ← K*X; Y' ← Y - T

precompute fac[0..K], inv2 = (mod+1)//2

for each comp:
  n ← size
  C ← n*(n-1)
  S ← 0; cnt_map ← empty map
  for each u in comp:
    BFS from u to get dist[v] for all v
    for v≠u:
      S += dist[v]
      if Y'>0 and dist[v]<Y': cnt_map[dist[v]]++
  record C_t, S_t mod mod, and cnt_map

P ← ∏_t (C_t mod mod)
B_all ← P * ∑_t (S_t * inv(C_t) mod mod) mod mod

if Y'≤0:
  A ← P; B ← B_all
else:
  dp[0..Y'-1] ← 0; dp[0]=1
  for each comp t:
    let cnt_map = small distances for comp t
    if cnt_map empty: dp ← all zeros; break
    newdp ← zeros
    for d,count in cnt_map:
      for s in [0..Y'-1-d]:
        newdp[s+d] += dp[s]*count
    dp ← newdp mod mod
  A_small ← sum(dp)
  B_small ← sum(s*dp[s])
  A ← (P - A_small) mod mod
  B ← (B_all - B_small) mod mod

term ← (B + T*A) mod mod
coef ← fac[K-1] * inv2 mod mod
answer ← coef * term mod mod
print answer
```

I'll save the full implementation to `solution.py`.
