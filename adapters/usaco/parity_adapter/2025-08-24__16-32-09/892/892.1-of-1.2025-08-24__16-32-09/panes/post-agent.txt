[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3,
\dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

The cows are a bit sleepy today, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ in the range $1 \ldots N-1$. The $k$ cows whom she passes will
amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find the minimum number of time steps required
to sort the cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers,
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, indicating the starting order of the cows.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single integer: the number of time steps before the $N$ cows are in sorted
order, if Farmer John acts optimally.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2 4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

[2025-08-24T21:57:30] thinking

**Explaining solution strategy**

The user wants a thorough thought process for a sorting problem involving cows. First, I need to clearly restate the problem: we need to determine the minimum n
umber of moves required to sort a permutation by allowed operations, specifically moving the first cow to later positions.

To conceptualize a solution, I realize this problem is about finding the longest increasing suffix that ends at N.

I'll provide pseudocode in my final document to illustrate the approach, showcasing reasoning about not disrupting the already sorted tail section. The optimal
moves involve rearranging cows into an increasing order, starting from the front.
**Analyzing cow sorting**

I understand I can move the front cow anywhere, so the key is to find the longest increasing suffix ending at N. For example, with a sample input like 1, 2, 4,
3, if we check from the end and find that the last segment isn’t in the correct order, the suffix length is zero.

I realize I should focus on those cows already in the right order, skipping them to minimize operations. The overall goal is to derive an increasing sequence en
ding in N to find the minimal moves needed for a sorted output.
**Finding optimal moves**

I realize I can't affect elements not at the front, but operations will impact subsequent positions. If I have a sorted tail at the end like [..., x, x+1, x+2,.
..,N], I don’t need to move them.

In the example of [1, 2, 4, 3], I keep checking for the longest increasing suffix. Moving cow1 typically requires repositioning, but I can explore whether I can
 avoid moving already sorted cows. The key is understanding that if the order becomes sorted before all cows have paid attention, I can stop early.

So, I need to analyze each move closely to identify an optimal strategy.
**Implementing cow sorting solution**

I'm figuring out how to approach the problem of sorting cows by moving the front cow around. The key is recognizing that we can identify a longest strictly incr
easing suffix and calculate the minimum moves needed to sort the sequence.

Additionally, I found out that the result equates to the number of cows before this suffix. If a sample input is [1, 2, 4, 3], I’ll confirm this by checking fro
m the end for increasing values.

Then, I’ll put together pseudocode to read the input, find the suffix, and print the moves needed, before saving it as solution.py. I’ll proceed with that imple
mentation now!
