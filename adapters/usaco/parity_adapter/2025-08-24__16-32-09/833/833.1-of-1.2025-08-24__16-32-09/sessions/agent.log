[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John owns a family-run farm that has been passed down over several
generations, with a herd of cows whose familial roots can similarly be traced
back several generations on the same farm.  By examining old records, Farmer
John is curious how the cows in his current herd are related to each-other.
Please help him in this endeavor!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$) followed by the names
of two cows.  Cow names are each strings of at most 10 uppercase letters
($A \ldots Z$). Farmer John is curious about the relationship between the two
cows on this line of input.  

The next $N$ lines each contain two cow names $X$ and $Y$, indicating that $X$
is the mother of $Y$.  

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You should print one line of output indicating the relationship between the two
cows specified on the first line of input (for simplicity, let's call these two
cows BESSIE and ELSIE for the examples below).  Here are the different types of
relationships that are possible:
You should output "SIBLINGS" if BESSIE and ELSIE have the same mother.BESSIE might be a direct descendant of ELSIE, meaning that ELSIE is either
the mother, grand-mother, great-grand-mother, great-great-grand-mother, etc., of
BESSIE. If this is the case, you should print "ELSIE is the (relation) of
BESSIE", where (relation) is the appropriate relationship, for example
"great-great-grand-mother".If ELSIE is a child of an ancestor of
BESSIE (and ELSIE is not herself an ancestor or sister of BESSIE), then ELSIE is BESSIE's aunt.
You should output "ELSIE is the aunt of
BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's grand-mother, "ELSIE is the great-aunt
of BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's great-grand-mother, "ELSIE is the
great-great-aunt of BESSIE" if ELSIE is a child of BESSIE's
great-great-grand-mother, and so on.If BESSIE and ELSIE are related by
any other means (i.e., if they share a common ancestor), they are cousins, and
you should simply output "COUSINS".You should output "NOT RELATED" if
BESSIE and ELSIE have no common ancestor, or neither is directly descended from
the other.

The following diagram helps illustrate the relationships above, which are the
only relationship types you need to consider.  Observe that 
some relationships like "niece" (daughter of sister) are not necessary since if
BESSIE is the niece of ELSIE, then ELSIE is BESSIE's aunt.

GMOTHER MOTHER

**Implementing a Solution**

The user wants me to implement a solution with clear steps. First, I need to restate the problem: "Given mother relationships, find the relationship between two cows." 

Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution: I’ll build parent pointers, generate an ancestors list for each cow, and check their relationships. 

The steps involve reading names and relationships, building a map, traversing maternal lines, and determining if one cow is an ancestor or if they share the same mother, among other things. Then, I’d write pseudocode and save it as a script.
**Defining Relationships**

I’m thinking about determining relationships between two cows, especially when it comes to ancestors. If a cow’s mother is at generation g, I find out if they are an aunt or a great-aunt based on that. For example, if E’s mother equals the grandmother, then E is simply an aunt. 

Now, I’ll make sure to identify the relationship properly when checking if one cow is an ancestor of the other. The order of names matters, so if cow C2 is an ancestor of C1, I’ll make sure to format it as “C2 is the ... of C1” correctly.
**Planning Relationship Checks**

I need to account for corner cases, such as when a mother mapping is missing. For example, if C1's mother is absent, I should be cautious about sibling checks, as they should come before cousin or unrelated checks. It’s crucial to ensure I handle siblings properly since they imply equal mothers, while an aunt would require a deeper ancestor check.

I should implement a checking order: first siblings, then ancestor checks, and finally determine if they are cousins or not related. While planning might seem unnecessary, I’ll lay out the necessary steps: restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, create pseudocode, and prepare to save the Python file. However, since the user wants the solution file only, I’ll focus directly on those components before concluding with the implementation.
**Drafting the Code**

I'm getting ready to draft the code for the relationship task. I'll start by reading input data for the number of relationships and names. Then, I’ll build a map of mothers and create a function to retrieve ancestors.

I need to check for relationships, starting with siblings, then see if one is an ancestor of the other, followed by checking for aunts, and finally if they're cousins. I’ll be careful with formatting and make sure to test every part. 

Once everything looks good, I'll create the `solution.py` file and proceed with the implementation!

1. Problem restated:
- Given a list of mother→child links, determine how two given cows are related (siblings, direct ancestor, aunt/great-aunt, cousins, or not related).

2. Conceptual solution:
- Build a `mother` map from child to its mother.
- For each target cow, walk up the maternal chain to record each ancestor’s depth.
- Check in order:
  1. Same mother → “SIBLINGS”
  2. One is ancestor of the other → “X is the […]-mother of Y”
  3. One is aunt/great-aunt of the other → “X is the […] of Y”
  4. Share any ancestor → “COUSINS”
  5. Otherwise → “NOT RELATED”

3. Pseudocode:
```
read N, cow1, cow2
build mother dict from next N lines
asc1 = get_ancestors(cow1)
asc2 = get_ancestors(cow2)

if same mother: print SIBLINGS
elif cow2 in asc1: print “cow2 is the REL of cow1”
elif cow1 in asc2: print “cow1 is the REL of cow2”
elif mother[cow2] in asc1 at depth>=2: print “cow2 is the REL-aunt of cow1”
elif mother[cow1] in asc2 at depth>=2: print “cow1 is the REL-aunt of cow2”
elif asc1 ∩ asc2 nonempty: print COUSINS
else: print NOT RELATED
```

4. Implementation saved to `solution.py`.
