[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Perimeter [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John has arranged N hay bales (1 <= N <= 50,000) in the middle of
one of his fields.  If we think of the field as a 1,000,000 x 1,000,000
grid of 1 x 1 square cells, each hay bale occupies exactly one of these
cells (no two hay bales occupy the same cell, of course).

FJ notices that his hay bales all form one large connected region, meaning
that starting from any bale, one can reach any other bale by taking a
series of steps either north, south, east, or west onto directly adjacent
bales.  The connected region of hay bales may however contain "holes" --
empty regions that are completely surrounded by hay bales.

Please help FJ determine the perimeter of the region formed by his hay
bales.  Note that holes do not contribute to the perimeter.

PROBLEM NAME: perimeter

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of hay bales, N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the (x,y) location of a single hay
        bale, where x and y are integers both in the range
        1..1,000,000. Position (1,1) is the lower-left cell in FJ's
        field, and position (1000000,1000000) is the upper-right cell.

SAMPLE INPUT:

8
10005 200003
10005 200004
10008 200004
10005 200005
10006 200003
10007 200003
10007 200004
10006 200005

INPUT DETAILS:

The connected region consisting of hay bales looks like this:

XX
X XX
XXX

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The perimeter of the connected region of hay bales.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

14

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The length of the perimeter of the connected region is 14 (for example, the
left side of the region contributes a length of 3 to this total).  Observe
that the hole in the middle does not contribute to this number.

**Planning the coding task**

I'm thinking about how to process the bale list by scanning it into a set. For each bale, I plan to check its four neighbors, counting those that are also in th
e set. This should allow for an efficient O(N) solution. I need to outline our approach step by step: first, restate the problem; next, conceptualize the soluti
on; then draft pseudocode; and finally implement the code in a file. I think organizing this into four clear steps will help us tackle it effectively!
**Organizing the coding steps**

I'm figuring out how to approach our task in a structured way. I think it’s best to create a single plan but communicate each step separately. First, I can outl
ine the tasks as four steps and mark their statuses. The initial step is to restate the problem, followed by conceptualizing the solution, writing pseudocode, a
nd finally implementing the solution.

I’ll set the groundwork for the implementation, making sure to optimize for performance, especially with file reading. It's starting to come together!
**Finalizing the plan**

Now I'm wrapping things up. After creating the solution file, I'll mark step four as complete in the plan. It might be a good idea to ask if the user wants test
ing, but they haven't mentioned that yet, so I think we'll stick with just marking everything done.

First, I’ll initiate the update for the plan, detailing the statuses of the steps — this keeps everything organized. Then, I'll move to the next steps smoothly.
 Let's get this done!

Here’s the solution outlined and implemented:

**1. Restatement**
Given N occupied cells on a large grid forming one connected component (with possible internal holes), compute the total exterior perimeter length (ignore holes
).

**2. Conceptual Approach**
- Store all hay-bale coordinates in a set for O(1) lookups.
- Each cell has 4 potential sides; for each of the 4 neighbors, if there’s no bale there, that side contributes 1 to the perimeter.
- Sum these contributions over all bales.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N
bales = empty set
for i in 1..N:
    read x, y
    add (x, y) to bales
perimeter = 0
for each (x, y) in bales:
    for each (dx, dy) in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
        if (x+dx, y+dy) not in bales:
            perimeter += 1
print perimeter
```

**4. Implementation**
The full Python 3 solution is saved in `solution.py`. It reads from standard input and writes the result to standard output.
