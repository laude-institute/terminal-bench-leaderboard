[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Nearby Cows [Neal Wu and Eric Price, 2011]

Farmer John has noticed that his cows often move between nearby fields. 
Taking this into account, he wants to plant enough grass in each of his
fields not only for the cows situated initially in that field, but also for
cows visiting from nearby fields.

Specifically, FJ's farm consists of N fields (1 <= N <= 100,000), where
some pairs of fields are connected with bi-directional trails (N-1 of them
in total).  FJ has designed the farm so that between any two fields i and
j, there is a unique path made up of trails connecting between i and j. 
Field i is home to C(i) cows, although cows sometimes move to a different
field by crossing up to K trails (1 <= K <= 20).  

FJ wants to plant enough grass in each field i to feed the maximum number
of cows, M(i), that could possibly end up in that field -- that is, the
number of cows that can potentially reach field i by following at most K
trails.  Given the structure of FJ's farm and the value of C(i) for each
field i, please help FJ compute M(i) for every field i.

**Conceptualizing tree solution**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution to a problem involving a tree with node weights. I need to restate the problem: compute the sum of weights for each node within a K-distance neighborhood, without using external libraries. The challenge is that a naive BFS approach could be costly, especially with N up to 100k and K up to 20. Though the operations could reach 2 million, I need to consider the potential overhead of BFS and adjacency lists in Python. Let's explore an efficient approach!
**Optimizing tree algorithm**

I'm considering a dynamic programming approach to solve the tree problem more efficiently. By implementing rerooting or multi-source BFS, I can improve the computation of node weights. The idea is to create two passes: one calculates weights in each subtree, and the second focuses on contributions from the parent side. 

I need to ensure that I'm managing memory well, especially with entries going up to 2 million. The time complexity is manageable, but I must consider the recursion limits in Python. An iterative solution might be necessary.
**Planning algorithm implementation**

I'm looking at how to implement a solution for the tree problem with memory and code efficiency. I'll use arrays to manage size and memory, planning for 20MB in total. My approach includes building the adjacency list through BFS, and iterating post-order to compute values in a structured manner.

I’ll also create a script named solution.py containing the implemented code. I'll restate the problem and provide a conceptual overview, along with pseudocode in my response. This way, I’m meeting all the user’s expectations while keeping memory and execution efficient!

**Problem Restatement**  
Given a tree of N fields, each with C(i) cows, compute for every field i the total number of cows that can reach it by traversing at most K edges.

**Solution Concept**  
- Root the tree at node 1 (0-indexed as 0).  
- First pass (post-order DP): for each node, compute `dp_down[u][d]` = sum of cows in u’s subtree exactly d edges away.  
- Second pass (pre-order DP): propagate `dp_up[u][d]` = sum of cows outside u’s subtree exactly d edges away.  
- Finally, for each node u, M(u) = sum_{d=0..K}(dp_down[u][d] + dp_up[u][d]).  

**Pseudocode**  
```
read N, K
read adjacency list
read C[0..N-1]
build parent[] and children[] via BFS from root 0
initialize dp_down[N][K+1] to 0
for u in reversed(BFS order):
    dp_down[u][0] = C[u]
    for each child v of u:
        for d=1..K:
            dp_down[u][d] += dp_down[v][d-1]

initialize M[N]
stack ← [(0, up_array=[0]*(K+1))]
while stack:
    u, up = stack.pop()
    M[u] = sum(dp_down[u][d] + up[d] for d=0..K)
    for each child v of u:
        new_up = [0]*(K+1)
        for d=1..K:
            val = up[d-1] + dp_down[u][d-1]
            if d≥2: val -= dp_down[v][d-2]
            new_up[d] = val
        stack.push((v, new_up))

print M[0..N-1]
```
