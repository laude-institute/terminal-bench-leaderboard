[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is trying to walk from her favorite pasture back to her barn.

The pasture and farm are on an $N \times N$ grid ($2 \leq N \leq 50$), with her
pasture in the top-left corner and the barn in the bottom-right corner. Bessie
wants to get home as soon as possible, so she will only walk down and to the
right. There are haybales in some locations that Bessie cannot walk through; she
must walk around them.

Bessie is feeling a little tired today, so she wants to change the direction she
walks at most $K$ times ($1 \leq K \leq 3$) .

How many distinct paths can Bessie walk from her favorite pasture to the barn?
Two paths are distinct if Bessie walks in a square in one path but not in the
other.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input for each test case contains $T$ sub-test cases, each describing a
different farm and each of which must be  answered correctly to pass the full
test case.  The first line of input  contains $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 50$).  Each of
the $T$ sub-test cases follow.

Each sub-test case starts with a line containing $N$ and $K$.

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of $N$ characters. Each character is
either $\texttt{.}$ if it is empty or $\texttt{H}$ if it has a haybale. It is
guaranteed the top-left and bottom-right corners of the farm will not contain
haybales.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $T$ lines, the $i$th line containing the number of distinct paths Bessie
can take in the $i$th sub-test case.

We'll denote Bessie's possible paths as strings of D's and R's, indicating that
Bessie moved either down or right, respectively.

In the first sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the second sub-test case, Bessie's four possible walks are DDRR, DRRD, RDDR,
and RRDD.

In the third sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRR, DRDR, DRRD,
RDDR, RDRD, and RRDD.

In the fourth sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the fifth and sixth sub-test cases, it is impossible for Bessie to walk back
to the barn.

In the seventh sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRDRR, DDRRDR,
DDRRRD, RRDDDR, RRDDRD, and RRDRDD.

SCORING:
Test case 2 satisfies $K = 1$.Test cases 3-5 satisfy $K = 2$.Test cases 6-10 satisfy $K = 3$.

[2025-08-24T21:23:01] thinking

**Considering algorithm design**

I'm working on a combinatorial solution, realizing that for N=50, the counts are vastly limited by k<=3. Still, Python's big integers can handle that. My concep
tual approach is to use dynamic programming, initializing a 4D array for grid navigation. I’ll account for free cells and previous moves to track different ways
 to reach the endpoint. An edge case exists for N=1, but since N must be 2 or more, I can ignore that. I’m ensuring all bases are covered as I refine my plan.
**Refining initialization strategy**

I’m considering how to initialize my dynamic programming array. Instead of starting with dp[0][0], I could set dp[0][0][0][0] and dp[0][0][0][1] to 1 for no pre
vious direction. However, moving right from the start counts as a turn, complicating things. A better approach might be to initialize direct neighbors manually,
 ensuring that the first move is treated correctly without counting it as a turn. I plan to implement these refinements in my script and carefully manage input
reading for the grid.
**Finalizing solution approach**

I’m deciding to focus on writing the solution directly in solution.py, rather than creating a multi-step plan. A succinct approach is what I need! I’ll skip the
 lengthy explanation and just produce the final answer consisting of four parts. First, I’ll restate the problem: Bessie moves from the top-left to the bottom-r
ight of a grid with obstacles, only moving down or right, with K allowed direction changes. Then, I’ll outline the dynamic programming solution and provide the
pseudocode, followed by applying the patch to create the solution file.

Here’s the complete Python solution:

1. **Problem Restatement**
   Count the number of ways Bessie can walk from the top-left to bottom-right of an N×N grid with obstacles, moving only down or right, and changing direction a
t most K times.

2. **Solution Concept**
   Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][j][k][d]` is the number of ways to reach cell (i,j) having used k turns, with the last step in direction d (0=down, 1=ri
ght). Initialize the first moves from the start, then iterate over the grid, transitioning from cells above (for a down move) or left (for a right move), increm
enting the turn count when changing direction. Sum over all turn counts ≤ K and both end-directions at the destination.

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   read T
   for each test:
     read N, K and grid
     init dp[N][N][K+1][2] = 0
     if (0,1) free: dp[0][1][0][1] = 1
     if (1,0) free: dp[1][0][0][0] = 1
     for i,j over grid:
       if obstacle: continue
       for k in 0..K:
         # down move from above
         if i>0 for each d:
           ways = dp[i-1][j][k][d]
           if ways>0:
             nd=0
             if d==nd: dp[i][j][k][nd]+=ways
             elif k<K: dp[i][j][k+1][nd]+=ways
         # right move from left
         if j>0 for each d:
           ways = dp[i][j-1][k][d]
           nd=1; same logic
     answer = sum dp[N-1][N-1][k][d] for k≤K, d in {0,1}
     print answer
   ```

4. **Saved File**
   The full implementation is in `solution.py`. You can run it with Python 3, supplying the input via stdin.
