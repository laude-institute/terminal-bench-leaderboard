[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has a large field, and he is thinking of planting sweet corn in some
part of it. After surveying his field, FJ found that it forms an
$(N-1) \times (N-1)$ square. The southwest corner is at coordinates $(0,0)$, and
the northeast corner is at $(N-1,N-1)$.

At some integer coordinates there are double-headed sprinklers, each one
sprinkling both water and fertilizer. A double-heading sprinkler at coordinates
$(i,j)$  sprinkles water on the part of the field north and east of it, and
sprinkles fertilizer on the part of the field south and west of it. Formally, it
waters all real coordinates $(x,y)$ for which $N \geq x \geq i$ and
$N \geq y \geq j$, and it fertilizes all real coordinates $(x,y)$ for which
$0 \leq x \leq i$ and $0 \leq y \leq j$.

Farmer John wants to plant sweet corn in some axis-aligned rectangle in his
field with integer-valued corner coordinates. However, for the sweet corn to
grow, all points in the rectangle must be both watered and fertilized by the
double-headed sprinklers. And of course the rectangle must have positive area,
or Farmer John wouldn't be able to grow any corn in it!

Help Farmer John determine the number of rectangles of positive area in which he
could grow sweet corn. Since this number may be large, output the remainder of
this number modulo
$10^9 + 7$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $N$, the size of the
field ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$).

The next $N$ lines each contain two space-separated integers. If these integers
are $i$ and $j$, where $0 \leq i,j \leq N-1$, they denote a sprinkler located at
$(i,j)$.

It is guaranteed that there is exactly one sprinkler in each column and exactly
one sprinkler in each row. That is, no two sprinklers have the same
$x$-coordinate, and no two sprinklers have the same $y$-coordinate.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of a single integer: the number of rectangles of
positive area which are fully watered and fully fertilized, modulo $10^9 + 7$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
0 4
1 1
2 2
3 0
4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
21

[2025-08-24T21:24:51] thinking

**Analyzing sprinkler coverage**

I need to ensure that every point in a rectangle is watered by at least one sprinkler's northeast coverage and fertilized by another's southwest coverage. This
means I'm seeking rectangles that sit entirely within both the watering and fertilizing regions. The tricky part is that each sprinkler operates separately for
watering and fertilizing. So, I need to focus on the union of the regions to identify the valid rectangle areas where both conditions are met.
**Understanding sprinkler coverage**

The fertilization area consists of the union of all southwest rectangles from the sprinklers. To determine if a point is "watered," it needs to fall within some
one’s northeast region, and similarly for being "fertilized" with the southwest region. Thus, the rectangle must sit entirely within the intersection of these t
wo unions. I’m considering how to define these unions, calculating the minimum coordinates for sprinklers to ensure both coverage conditions are met for any giv
en rectangle in the area.
**Implementing the algorithm**

I’m working to precompute values A and B for all pairs (l,r), ensuring that where A[l] < B[r], I can sum T(B[r] - A[l]). It involves switching loops to evaluate
 for each r and considering multipliers efficiently, ensuring I keep track of values correctly using a data structure like a Fenwick tree for efficiency.

Then I'll maintain counts and sums as I iterate, updating values as necessary and ensuring modular arithmetic is used properly. Finally, I’ll draft the pseudoco
de and code, organizing a solution file.
**Drafting the solution**

I need to follow the steps laid out in the user's request to produce a structured answer. First, I'll restate the problem, then conceptualize the solution, and
finally write the pseudocode. After that, I’ll indicate that I’m writing the solution.py file.

I'll format the sections clearly, using numbered headings for organization. The patch will include the necessary code, while ensuring I'm maintaining the correc
t indexing for the BIT arrays. Finally, I’ll ensure everything wraps neatly in the main function for clarity. Let's get started!

1. Problem Restatement
Given an N×N grid with one “double-headed sprinkler” per row and column (a permutation P), each sprinkler at (i,P[i]) waters all points (x,y) with x≥i and y≥P[i
], and fertilizes all points with x≤i and y≤P[i]. Count how many axis-aligned rectangles of positive area lie entirely within both the water and fertilizer cove
rage (mod 10^9+7).

2. Solution Outline
- Read the sprinkler positions into a permutation P of size N.
- Compute prefix minima A[i]=min(P[0..i]) and suffix maxima B[i]=max(P[i..N-1]).
- A rectangle spanning columns [l,r] is valid in y if its y-range fits within [A[l], B[r]]. For l<r, the count of integer (y1<y2) choices is T = (d·(d+1)/2) whe
re d = B[r]−A[l], provided d>0.
- Total rectangles = sum over all pairs (l<r) with A[l]<B[r] of T(B[r]−A[l]).
- To compute this in O(N log N), sweep r from 1 to N−1, maintain a Fenwick tree over all previous A[l], storing count, sum(A[l]), sum(A[l]^2). For each r, query
 statistics for all A[l] < B[r], and add the aggregated contribution using the quadratic expansion of T(d).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read P[0..N-1]
A[0]=P[0]
for i=1..N-1: A[i]=min(A[i-1],P[i])
B[N-1]=P[N-1]
for i=N-2..0: B[i]=max(B[i+1],P[i])

initialize Fenwicks: tree_c, tree_s, tree_s2
ans=0
for r in 1..N-1:
    insert A[r-1] into Fenwicks (count+=1, sumA+=A, sumA2+=A^2)
    let Br = B[r]
    if Br>0:
        query Fenwicks for all a < Br: get c, sumA, sumA2
        t1 = Br^2 + Br
        part = [c*t1 − (2*Br+1)*sumA + sumA2] / 2 mod
        ans += part

print ans mod
```
