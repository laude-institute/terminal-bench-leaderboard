[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Optimal Milking [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John has recently purchased a new barn containing N milking machines
(1 <= N <= 40,000), conveniently numbered 1..N and arranged in a row.

Milking machine i is capable of extracting M(i) units of milk per day (1 <=
M(i) <= 100,000).  Unfortunately, the machines were installed so
close together that if a machine i is in use on a particular day, its two
neighboring machines cannot be used that day (endpoint machines have only
one neighbor, of course).  Farmer John is free to select different subsets
of machines to operate on different days.

Farmer John is interested in computing the maximum amount of milk he can
extract over a series of D days (1 <= D <= 50,000).  At the beginning of
each day, he has enough time to perform maintenance on one selected milking
machine i, thereby changing its daily milk output M(i) from that day forward.
Given a list of these daily modifications, please tell Farmer John how much
milk he can produce over D days (note that this number might not fit into a
32-bit integer).

PROBLEM NAME: optmilk

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The values of N and D.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the initial value of M(i).

* Lines 2+N..1+N+D: Line 1+N+d contains two integers i and m,
        indicating that Farmer John updates the value of M(i) to m at
        the beginning of day d.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 3
1
2
3
4
5
5 2
2 7
1 10

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 machines, with initial milk outputs 1,2,3,4,5.  On day 1,
machine 5 is updated to output 2 unit of milk, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum total amount of milk FJ can produce over D days.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

32

OUTPUT DETAILS:

On day one, the optimal amount of milk is 2+4 = 6 (also achievable as
1+3+2).  On day two, the optimal amount is 7+4 = 11.  On day three, the
optimal amount is 10+3+2=15.

**Solving weight independent set**

I need to address the dynamic maximum weight independent set on a path. The constraints are challenging, with N going up to 40k and days up to 50k. A brute-forc
e approach isn't feasible due to the enormous number of operations. I plan to use a classic dynamic programming technique, maintaining a dp array to keep track
of the maximum prefix up to each node. I'll need to ensure it's efficient with updates and queries to the global optimum as they occur. This setup will allow fo
r timely calculations.
**Computing dynamic programming states**

I need dp[N] to update dynamically with point updates to A[i]. The recurrence shows that dp[i] depends only on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], which can be represented usi
ng 2x2 matrices. By expressing the state as a vector, I can set up a transformation matrix to evolve the state efficiently. Since maximum operators interfere wi
th linear algebra, I can't use segment trees straightforwardly. Instead, I’ll need to compute several key values for segments and merge them carefully to mainta
in the independent set conditions while tracking weights properly.
**Defining segment tree states**

I'm looking to model an input-output dependency where the selection of adjacent neighbors affects weight calculations for segments. I want to create a 2x2 matri
x for each segment to track which elements can be included based on neighboring selections. The challenge is ensuring that segment boundary conditions hold when
 combining segments, especially regarding adjacency constraints. I can use a matrix to represent the maximum weights under different inclusion scenarios to stru
cture this efficiently as a segment tree for the maximum weight independent set problem on a path.
**Exploring maximum weight independent set**

I'm treating the recurrence with vectors, specifically mapping current state based on previous states. To support updates in weights while querying total functi
ons, I’m employing a segment tree to store the necessary transformations efficiently. Each segment will house a 2x2 matrix to reflect the maximum weights under
different selection scenarios for the independent set. When merging segments, I’ll ensure to avoid choosing two adjacent elements while carefully tracking combi
nations. For each update and query, the operations will be manageable within logarithmic time complexity.
**Building the segment tree**

I'm correctly combining the updates with prefixes and determining how to manage the segment tree for these computations. After each update, I'll retrieve the ro
ot matrix to compute the maximum over four entries, ensuring I handle days efficiently. Since N can reach 40k, I need to ensure I allocate adequate space for st
oring up to four integers per node, which could require large values, so I'll use 64-bit integers. Also, I need to structure the tree carefully, accounting for
neutral segments that contribute nothing, while maintaining effective adjacency constraints for actual segments.

1. Restated Problem
- We have \(N\) machines in a line, each with a nonnegative weight \(M[i]\).  Each day we may pick any subset of machines with no two adjacent, to maximize tota
l milk.
- Over \(D\) days, on each day we first update one \(M[i]\), then collect the optimal independent‐set sum for that day's weights.  We must output the grand tota
l over all days.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Maintain a segment tree over the linear chain.
- At each node, store a 2×2 table \(\text{mat}[a][b]\) = max weight in that segment given whether we include (1) or exclude (0) the left endpoint (state \(a\))
and right endpoint (state \(b\)), forbidding any internal adjacency.
- Leaf for machine \(i\):
  - mat[0][0]=0, mat[0][1]=mat[1][0]=\(M[i]\), mat[1][1]=−∞.
- To merge two child tables \(L\), \(R\), we compute each combined entry by taking the best over all splits that don’t select both adjacent midpoints:
  \(\displaystyle C[a][d]=\max_{b,c\in\{0,1\},\;(b,c)\neq(1,1)}[\,L[a][b]+R[c][d]\,]\).
- After each point update, update the leaf and re‐merge up to the root (\(O(\log N)\)).  The best independent‐set sum is \(\max_{a,b} \text{root}[a][b]\).  Accu
mulate over \(D\) days.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, D
read array A[0..N-1]

build segment_tree on [0..N-1]:
  each node stores 4 values [m00,m01,m10,m11]
  leaf at i: [0, A[i], A[i], -INF]
  internal: merge children L,R via
    c00 = max(L00+R00, L00+R10, L01+R00)
    c01 = max(L00+R01, L00+R11, L01+R01)
    c10 = max(L10+R00, L10+R10, L11+R00)
    c11 = max(L10+R01, L10+R11, L11+R01)

total = 0
for day in 1..D:
  read i, m
  update leaf i with m, re-merge
  best = max(root.m00, m01, m10, m11)
  total += best

print total
```

4. Solution Saved
- The full implementation has been created in `solution.py`.
