[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Photo [Travis Hance, 2013]

FJ wants to take pictures of his N cows (2 <= N <= 1,000,000,000), which
are standing in a line and conveniently numbered 1..N.  Each photograph can
capture a consecutive range of cows from the lineup, and FJ wants to make
sure that each cow appears in at least one photo.

Unfortunately, there are K unfriendly pairs of cows (1 <= K <= 1000) that
each refuse to be in the same photograph.  Given the locations of these
unfriendly pairs, please determine the minimum number of photos FJ needs to
take.

PROBLEM NAME: photo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 contains two integers, A_i and B_i, stating
        that the cows in positions A_i and B_i are unfriendly and
        therefore cannot be in the same photograph.

SAMPLE INPUT:

7 3
1 3
2 4
5 6

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the minimum number of photos FJ
        needs to take.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can take 3 photos:
- One ranging from 1 to 2.
- One ranging from 3 to 5.
- One ranging from 6 to 7.

[2025-08-24T20:46:59] thinking

**Considering interval cuts**

I'm thinking about how to handle this problem with large N without using an array. First, I'll read N and K and build a list of intervals. For each pair, I need
 to identify the minimum and maximum values to determine the range. If there's a gap of at least one, I can make a cut. Next, I sort the intervals by their endp
oints and use a greedy strategy to count the cuts needed. Finally, I'll output the total number of intervals plus one for the last cut.
**Implementing the solution**

I'm working on my implementation plan. First, I’ll start with a clear definition of the problem: I need to determine how many cuts are necessary based on given
intervals. Next, I’ll conceptualize my approach, noting that I’ll create a list of intervals based on minimum and maximum values.

In my pseudocode, I’ll outline the steps: read inputs, parse intervals, sort them, and apply my greedy strategy for cutting. Finally, I’ll implement this logic
in a new Python file named solution.py, ensuring it follows the requirements.
**Finalizing the implementation**

I’m considering the edge case where K is zero—it should simply print one. For the initial value of cur_cut, I think starting at zero makes more sense, given tha
t l is always at least one.

Now, let’s restate the problem: I need to photograph N cows in a line, while ensuring that certain pairs remain separated. My solution involves interpreting con
straints as intervals and using a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum cuts needed.

I’ve written the code, ensuring to include all necessary details as I prepare to apply the patch.

Here’s the complete solution:

**Problem Restatement**
- Partition cows 1…N into consecutive photo segments so every cow is photographed.
- Certain pairs (A, B) can’t appear in the same segment.

**Solution Concept**
- Each unfriendly pair (A,B) forces a cut between positions A and B.
- Model as intervals [min(A,B), max(A,B)−1] that must each contain at least one cut.
- Greedily place cuts at the earliest possible right endpoints to hit all intervals.
- Number of photos = cuts + 1.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K
intervals = []
for each unfriendly pair:
    l = min(A, B), r = max(A, B) − 1
    append (l, r)
sort intervals by r ascending
cuts = 0; last_cut = 0
for (l, r) in intervals:
    if last_cut < l:
        cuts += 1
        last_cut = r
print(cuts + 1)
```

The solution is saved in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests!
