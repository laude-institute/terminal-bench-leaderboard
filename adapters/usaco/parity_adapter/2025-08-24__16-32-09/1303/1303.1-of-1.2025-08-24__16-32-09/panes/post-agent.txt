[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, two times the default.**

Somebody has been grazing in Farmer John's $(1 \le G \le 10^5)$
private gardens! Using his expert forensic knowledge, FJ has been able to
determine the precise time each garden was grazed.  He has also determined that
there was a single cow that was responsible for every grazing incident.

In response to these crimes each of FJ's $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10^5)$
cows have provided an alibi that proves the cow was in a specific location at a
specific time.  Help FJ test whether each of these alibis demonstrates the cow's
innocence.

A cow can be determined to be innocent if it is impossible for her to have
travelled between all of the grazings and her alibi.  Cows travel at a rate of 1
unit distance per unit time.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input will contain $G$ and $N$ separated by a space.

The next $G$ lines contain the integers $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of the grazing.  It will always be possible for
a single cow to travel between all grazings.

The next $N$ lines contain $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of each cow's alibi.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer: the number of cows with alibis that prove their
innocence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
0 0 100
50 0 200
0 50 50
1000 1000 0
50 0 200
10 0 170
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

There were two grazings; the first at $(0, 0)$ at time $100$ and the
second at $(50, 0)$ at time $200$.

The first cow's alibi does not prove her innocence.  She has just enough time to
arrive at the first grazing.

The second cow's alibi does prove her innocence.  She is nowhere near any of the
grazings.

Unfortunately for the third cow, being at the scene of the crime does not prove
innocence.

Finally, the fourth cow is innocent because it's impossible to make it from her
alibi to the final grazing in time.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: $1 \le G, N \le 10^3$. Also, for both the fields and alibis,
$-10^6 \le x, y \le 10^6$ and  $0 \le t \le 10^6$. Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T21:45:30] thinking

**Breaking down the problem**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution to a specific problem. First, I should restate the problem in simple terms. Next, I need to conceptualize a plain En
glish solution before crafting pseudocode. Lastly, I’ll save my solution in a file named `solution.py` without using any outside libraries.

For this problem, I need to analyze grazing points and alibi details. It's crucial to ensure that a cow's alibi makes it impossible for it to have been responsi
ble for any grazing events.
**Clarifying the grazing problem**

For a cow to maintain its innocence, it must start from its alibi location at a specific time and reach each grazing event sequentially sorted by time. The key
aspect is determining the timing of the alibi concerning the grazing events. If the alibi is before all the grazings, the cow needs to travel to the first grazi
ng. If it's after, the journey would go in reverse. We can establish distance constraints: if travel distance exceeds time differences, the cow is guilty. Essen
tially, I need to count how many potential alibis are impossible to fit into the grazing timeline, striving for an efficient solution.
**Detailing the solution process**

I'm considering a strategy to identify how to determine if a cow is innocent based on grazing events and alibis. First, I’ll use binary search on grazing times
to find the appropriate grazing indices relative to the alibi time. Depending on the alibi's position—before, after, or between grazing events—I’ll check the tr
avel distances to see if they comply with the time constraints.

I need to ensure the distance calculations are based on Euclidean metrics, avoiding unnecessary square roots for efficiency. After outlining these checks, I'll
write a solution that includes input parsing, sorting of grazing events, and the overall logic—all while adhering to the user’s requirements.

**Restatement**
We have G grazing incidents each at a known (x, y) coordinate and time t, and N cow alibis (each also at a specific (x, y, t)). A single cow (travel speed = 1 u
nit distance per unit time) committed all grazings in chronological order. An alibi proves innocence if it’s impossible for that cow to have been at the alibi p
oint/time and also attend every grazing.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort grazings by time.
- For each alibi (xa, ya, ta), find its slot among grazing times via binary search:
  - If it’s before the first grazing, check if distance to the first grazing exceeds available time.
  - If after the last grazing, check distance from last grazing to alibi.
  - If between two grazings, check both “previous→alibi” and “alibi→next” legs.
- If any required leg’s Euclidean distance > time difference, that alibi is impossible → cow is innocent.
- Count all such alibis.

**Pseudocode**
```
read G, N
read list of G grazings (x, y, t)
sort grazings by t
extract times[], xs[], ys[] aligned
count = 0
for each alibi (xa, ya, ta):
    k = first index in times[] where times[k] > ta
    if k == 0:
        check distance(alibi, grazing[0]) > times[0] - ta
    elif k == G:
        check distance(grazing[G-1], alibi) > ta - times[G-1]
    else:
        check either
          distance(grazing[k-1], alibi) > ta - times[k-1], or
          distance(alibi, grazing[k]) > times[k] - ta
    if any check true:
        count += 1
print(count)
```
