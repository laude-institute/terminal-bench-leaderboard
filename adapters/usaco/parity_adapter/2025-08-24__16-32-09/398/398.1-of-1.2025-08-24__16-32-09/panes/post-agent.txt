[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25,000), each with an associated length.
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 7
2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7
4 5 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the
house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's
        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a
        single pathway.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4
(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,
of total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.

[2025-08-24T21:45:22] thinking

**Analyzing pathfinding strategy**

The user wants a step-by-step explanation. First, let's restate the problem in simple terms: we need to find the shortest path while considering the effect of d
oubling edge weights in a graph. I think a conceptual solution is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm multiple times.

Since the brute force method is computationally expensive with given constraints, I’ll find the initial shortest path, then alter each edge on that path and cal
culate the new shortest path length to track changes. I’ll keep in mind that doubling edges not part of the shortest path may impact future choices.
**Refining shortest path approach**

The shortest path remains unchanged when doubling edges not on that path, so only the edges in the initial shortest path matter. However, if I block an edge, th
e algorithm can pick an alternative route. To ensure accuracy, I need to recalculate the shortest path with the doubled weight for these edges.

Since doubling edges not on the shortest path has no impact, my increase in path length will be zero. I must compute the initial shortest path, save the edges,
and for each edge, double its weight to run Dijkstra again, tracking the maximum difference. Finally, I’ll print the max difference. The operations—and subseque
nt calculations—will be manageable within the constraints.
**Designing the Dijkstra solution**

I need to refine my approach for each edge in the path. I’ll double the weight in the adjacency list and edges array, then rerun Dijkstra to compute the distanc
e again. I'll find the difference between the new distance and the original distance, updating the maximum difference if needed. After restoring the weights, I’
ll print the maximum difference.

I’m planning to structure my final output in a clear way: restating the problem, conceptual explanation, pseudocode, and then the actual code. I want everything
 to be well-organized and easy to follow. I’ll also create separate Dijkstra functions as needed, while simplifying how I handle previous nodes. Finally, I’ll e
nsure to manage edge weights appropriately and apply the necessary changes for the solution.

Here’s the complete Python solution:

- Reads the graph, runs Dijkstra once recording the shortest path.
- Identifies each edge on that path.
- For each such edge, doubles its weight, reruns Dijkstra, and tracks the increase.
- Prints the maximum increase found.

The code is in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run it on samples or add any tests!
