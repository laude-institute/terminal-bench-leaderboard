[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Recording the Moolympics [Brian Dean, 2014]

Being a fan of all cold-weather sports (especially those involving cows),
Farmer John wants to record as much of the upcoming winter Moolympics as
possible.

The television schedule for the Moolympics consists of N different programs
(1 <= N <= 150), each with a designated starting time and ending time.  FJ
has a dual-tuner recorder that can record two programs simultaneously.
Please help him determine the maximum number of programs he can record in
total.

PROBLEM NAME: recording

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the start and end time of a single
        program (integers in the range 0..1,000,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
0 3
6 7
3 10
1 5
2 8
1 9

INPUT DETAILS:

The Moolympics broadcast consists of 6 programs.  The first runs from time
0 to time 3, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of programs FJ can record.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can record at most 4 programs.  For example, he can record programs 1
and 3 back-to-back on the first tuner, and programs 2 and 4 on the second
tuner.

**Planning a Python solution**

The user wants me to break down the problem step-by-step: first restating it, then conceptualizing a solution, drafting pseudocode, and finally creating a Pytho
n script named `solution.py`. I need to think through the constraints: with N up to 150 and time limits of 1e9, we're effectively selecting a maximum subset sch
edule using two machines for non-overlapping intervals. I'll apply a greedy algorithm to sort by end time and schedule the earliest available machine, which see
ms optimal for k=2. Let’s get to it!
**Conceptualizing job scheduling**

I’m thinking about how to schedule jobs effectively by sorting them by their end times and assigning them to the first available machine. If both machines are f
ree, I should pick the one with the earliest finish time. This strategy, known as interval scheduling with multiple machines, is optimal for maximizing the numb
er of non-preemptive jobs. I’ll maintain a list of finish times and use this to find which machine can take the next job efficiently.
**Drafting the solution**

I’m working on putting together the pseudocode for the scheduling problem. I’ll read the number of intervals and their start and end times, sort these by end ti
me, and maintain finish times for two machines. If I find an available machine for each interval, I’ll update the finish time and increment a count. The final s
tep is to write this logic into a Python script named `solution.py`. I’ll make sure to include input handling and focus on efficiency with the constraints provi
ded.

**Restatement**
We have N TV programs, each with a start and end time. Farmer John’s recorder has two tuners and can record up to two overlapping programs at once. We need the
maximum number of programs he can record in full.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort all programs by their end time (earliest finish first).
- Track the finish time of each of the two tuners.
- Iterate through programs in order:
  - Assign the program to the tuner that is free (its finish time ≤ program’s start) and that became free most recently (to keep the other tuner available for e
arlier slots).
  - If neither tuner is free at the program’s start, skip that program.
- Count each assignment; that total is the answer.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read list of (start, end) intervals
sort intervals by end
finishes = [0, 0]    # end times of tuner1 and tuner2
count = 0
for each (s, e) in intervals:
    best_idx = -1
    best_finish = -1
    for i in [0,1]:
        if finishes[i] <= s and finishes[i] > best_finish:
            best_finish = finishes[i]
            best_idx = i
    if best_idx != -1:
        finishes[best_idx] = e
        count += 1
print count
```

I’ve saved this solution as `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like to run tests or see further explanation!
