[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie is a busy computer science graduate student. However, even graduate
students need friends. As a result, Farmer John has opened a pasture with the
explicit purpose of helping Bessie and other cows form lasting friendships.

Farmer John's pasture can be regarded as a large 2D grid of square "cells"
(picture a huge chess board). Each cell is labeled with:

C if the cell contains a cow.G if the cell contains grass.. if the cell contains neither a cow nor grass.
For two distinct cows to become friends, the cows must choose to meet at  a
grass-covered square that is directly horizontally or vertically adjacent  to
both of them.  During the process, they eat the grass in the grass-covered
square, so future pairs of cows cannot use that square as a meeting point. The
same cow may become friends with more than one other cow,  but no pair of cows
may meet and become friends more than once.

Farmer John is hoping that numerous pairs of cows will meet and become friends
over time.  Please determine the maximum number of new friendships between
distinct pairs of cows that can possibly be created by the end of this
experience.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $M$ ($N,M \leq 1000$).

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of $M$ characters, describing the pasture.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Count the maximum number of pairs of cows that can become friends by the end
of the experience.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 5
.CGGC
.CGCG
CGCG.
.CC.C
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

If we label the cow in row $i$ and column $j$ with coordinates $(i,j)$, then in
this example there are cows at $(1,2)$, $(1,5)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,1)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,2)$,
$(4,3)$, and $(4,5)$. One way for four pairs of cows to become friends is as
follows:

The cows at $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$ eat the grass at $(3,2)$.The cows at $(2,2)$ and $(2,4)$ eat the grass at $(2,3)$.The cows at $(2,4)$ and $(3,3)$ eat the grass
at $(3,4)$.The cows at $(2,4)$ and $(1,5)$ eat the grass at $(2,5)$.
SCORING:
Test cases 2-4 satisfy $N=2$.Test cases 5-12 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Evaluating graph matching solution**

I'm looking to solve a graph matching problem involving cows on a grid with grass cells. The key is that each grass cell can only be used once, and cows can onl
y meet if they are adjacent to that cell. The goal is to maximize distinct pairs of cows meeting on grass. I see the cows as vertices and grass cells as hypered
ges connecting them. Each meeting uses a grass cell, and we need to ensure distinct pairs can form while reusing pairs across different meetings.
**Analyzing grass usage for pairings**

So, each grass cell can only be used for one meeting, and I want to form unique pairs of cows from adjacent grass cells. This leads me to think about maximum pa
irings, essentially a bipartite matching problem, but the pairs can repeat across meetings. The focus here is on maximizing distinct pairings while only using g
rass cells once.

I'll need to model this effectively; creating a graph where grass cells connect to adjacent cows could help facilitate this large number of combinations while a
voiding duplicate pairs. Each grass yields one meeting and I need to effectively track which pairs have already met!
**Exploring grass and cow connections**

The main limitation here is the grass cell availability and ensuring distinct cow pairs. Each grass cell connects potential pairs of cows, but I can only pick o
ne edge from each grass. If two cows are adjacent to multiple grass cells, I need to select only one for their pairing. This forms a bipartite matching problem.

Interestingly, diagonal cow pairs can lead to duplication of grass usage, but that’s rare. I’m thinking about building a bipartite graph based on cow placement
in a grid, which could help optimize identifying unique pairs while accounting for potential duplicates. A greedy approach might be effective due to their rarit
y!
**Analyzing cow and grass interactions**

I’m grappling with how adjacent cows can create conflicts with grass cells. If cows share two grasses, I can only choose one for their meeting, which complicate
s things. It might look like a maximum matching in a hypergraph, but I can also treat this as a bipartite graph matching.

To simplify, I think I could create a flow network with capacities that represent possible pairings. However, the potential number of pairs could be overwhelmin
g. My insight leads me to consider that counting adjacent cows for each grass cell is a key step, as it helps to avoid double counting while also correcting for
 conflicts.

By implementing a systematic approach to scan the grid, I can identify the viable grass cells and manage any overlapping counts from cow pairings effectively.

Here’s the Python solution:

**Restatement**
- We have a grid where cells are cows (C), grass (G), or empty (.).
- Two cows can become friends by meeting on a grass cell adjacent (up/down/left/right) to both, and that grass is then consumed.
- Each grass can support only one meeting, and each unordered cow pair can only meet once.
- Compute the maximum number of distinct friendships possible.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Every grass cell with ≥2 adjacent cows is a candidate meeting spot.
- However, two grasses might both serve the same cow pair only when those two cows are diagonal corners of a 2×2 square with the other two corners grass. In tha
t case, only one of those grasses can be used.
- So:
  1. Count all grasses adjacent to ≥2 cows.
  2. Find each 2×2 square where cows are on one diagonal and grasses on the other—each such square causes one overcount.
  3. Subtract those overcounts from the total.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
read grid[N][M]
initial = 0
for each cell (i,j):
    if grid[i][j] == 'G':
        cnt = number of 'C' in its 4 neighbors
        if cnt >= 2:
            initial += 1

corrections = 0
for i in 0..N-2:
  for j in 0..M-2:
    if diagonal pattern C-G / G-C in this 2×2:
      corrections += 1
    if the opposite diagonal pattern:
      corrections += 1

print(initial - corrections)
```

I’ve saved this as `solution.py`. You can run it with Python 3. Let me know if you’d like any tests or further tweaks!
