mer John'"'"'s cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ'"'"'s
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ'"'"'s route.

        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Roadblock [Brian Dean]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25,000), each with an associated length.
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

5 7
2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the
house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's
        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a
        single pathway.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4
(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,
of total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.

**Planning the solution**

The user is asking for a comprehensive solution that includes restatement of the problem, a conceptual solution, pseudocode, and then to save it as `solution.py
`. Since they mentioned steps for clarity, I should group the response under appropriate headers for organization.

I'll outline the initial task of reading inputs, computing the initial shortest path from 1 to N, doubling edges, and recalculating the shortest path thereafter
. However, this might pose performance challenges with larger input sizes. I need to clarify the requirement about doubling all paths rather than just the initi
al path.
**Structuring the approach**

I’m thinking of a better way to tackle this task. First, I’ll identify the edges on the initial shortest path using parent pointers. For each edge, I plan to do
uble its weight, recompute the shortest path with Dijkstra, and track the maximum distance difference. Since N is at most 250, I can manage up to 249 Dijkstra r
uns.

The overall steps are to build the adjacency list, run Dijkstra from the source, reconstruct the shortest path, and then perform the necessary adjustments. I’ll
 make sure to implement everything in the `solution.py` file as structured.

**Problem Restatement**
We have N fields connected by M bidirectional paths with given lengths. Farmer John travels from field 1 to field N along the shortest route. The cows will pick
 exactly one path to double its length, aiming to maximize the increase in the new shortest‐path distance from 1 to N. Compute that maximum possible increase.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Build the graph as adjacency lists.
- Run Dijkstra’s algorithm from field 1 to get the initial shortest distance and parent pointers.
- Reconstruct one actual shortest path from 1 to N using the parent array.
- For each edge on that path:
  - Temporarily double its weight (both directions in the adj list).
  - Re-run Dijkstra from 1 to compute the new shortest distance to N.
  - Record the increase over the original distance.
  - Revert the edge weight.
- Output the largest recorded increase.

**Pseudocode**
```
read n, m
build edge list and adjacency list adj
run Dijkstra(src=1) → dist[], parent[]
base = dist[n]

reconstruct path edges from n back to 1 via parent[]

max_increase = 0
for each (u,v) in path:
    double weight of edge (u,v) in adj
    new_dist = Dijkstra(src=1)[n]
    max_increase = max(max_increase, new_dist - base)
    revert weight of edge (u,v)
print max_increase
```

The complete implementation is saved in **solution.py**. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
