[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Bessie is using the latest and greatest innovation in text-editing software,
miV! She starts with an input string consisting solely of upper and lowercase
English letters and wishes to transform it into some output string. With just
one keystroke, miV allows her to replace all occurrences of one English letter
$c_1$ in the string with another English letter $c_2$. For example, given the
string $\texttt{aAbBa}$, if Bessie selects $c_1$ as 'a' and $c_2$ as 'B', the given string transforms into
$\texttt{BAbBB}$.

Bessie is a busy cow, so for each of $T$ ($1\le T\le 10$) independent test
cases, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to transform her input
string into her desired output string.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $T$, the number of independent test cases.

The following $T$ pairs of lines contain an input and output string of equal
length.  All characters are upper or lowercase English letters (either A through
Z or a through z). The sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case, output the minimum number of keystrokes required to change
the input string into the output string, or $-1$ if it is impossible to do so.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
abc
abc
BBC
ABC
abc
bbc
ABCD
BACD
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0
-1
1
3

The first input string is the same as its output string, so no keystrokes are
required.

The second input string cannot be changed into its output string because Bessie
cannot change one '$\texttt{B}$' to '$\texttt{A}$' while keeping the other as
'$\texttt{B}$'.

The third input string can be changed into its output string by changing
'$\texttt{a}$' to '$\texttt{b}$'.

The last input string can be changed into its output string like so:
$\texttt{ABCD} \rightarrow \texttt{EBCD} \rightarrow \texttt{EACD} \rightarrow \texttt{BACD}$.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-6: Every string has a length at most $50$.Inputs 7-9: All strings consist only of lowercase letters '$\texttt{a}$'
through '$\texttt{e}$'Inputs 10-15: No additional constraints.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T21:51:44] thinking

**Exploring letter transformation**

I'm looking at how to solve the problem of transforming one string into another using letter replacements. This feels a lot like a graph problem, with each lett
er as a node. The goal is to find the minimal operations needed to make these changes or determine if it's impossible. One key constraint is that transforming a
 letter must apply to all its occurrences at once, making the planning important. I need to think through the relationships carefully.
**Analyzing letter mapping**

I'm exploring the complexities of mapping letters in the input to the output strings. If a letter needs to serve two roles, that creates a conflict. Each letter
 must consistently map to one final letter unless there are intermediates. However, since transformations affect all occurrences at once, every letter that appe
ars must follow the same path. I'll check that all instances of a letter aim for the same target, ensuring we don’t run into contradictions. After establishing
mappings, I’ll focus on the minimal operations needed to achieve these transformations.
**Mapping transformations**

I’m defining a solution using a directed graph where each letter connects to its target based on mapping. My goal is to merge letters strategically while ensuri
ng no conflicts arise. If there are chains like a->b->c, the order of operations becomes critical. I'll need to handle cycles by using a temporary letter if req
uired, while also ensuring there’s no excess use of letters. In the end, my plan focuses on building this mapping and calculating the minimal operational steps
based on the edges and cycles involved.

I’ve created `solution.py` implementing the described approach:

- Validates consistent per-letter mappings or returns `-1`.
- Builds a directed graph of needed replacements.
- Counts 1 operation per edge plus 1 extra for each cycle.

Let me know if you’d like tests or further tweaks!
