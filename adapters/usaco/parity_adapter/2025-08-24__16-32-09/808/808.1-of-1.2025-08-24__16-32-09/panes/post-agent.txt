Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In preparation for the upcoming hoofball tournament, Farmer John is drilling his
$N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1\dots N$, where $1 \leq N \leq 100$) in
passing the ball. The cows are all standing along a very long line on one side
of the barn, with cow $i$ standing $x_i$ units away from the barn
($1 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).  Each cow is standing at a distinct location.

At the beginning of the drill, Farmer John will pass several balls to different
cows. When cow $i$ receives a ball, either from Farmer John or from another cow,
she will pass the ball to the cow nearest her (and if multiple cows are the same
distance from her, she will pass the ball to the cow farthest to the left among
these).  So that all cows get at least a little bit of practice passing, Farmer
John wants to make sure that every cow will hold a ball at least once. Help him
figure out the minimum number of balls he needs to distribute initially to
ensure this can happen, assuming he hands the balls to an appropriate initial
set of cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$. The second line contains $N$
space-separated integers, where the $i$th integer is $x_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the minimum number of balls Farmer John must initially pass to the
cows, so that every cow can hold a ball at least once.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 3 11 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

In the above example, Farmer John should pass a ball to the cow at $x=1$ and
pass a ball to the cow at $x=11$. The cow at $x=1$ will pass her ball to the cow
at $x=3$, after which this ball will oscillate between the cow at $x=3$ and the
cow at $x=4$. The cow at $x=11$ will pass her ball to the cow at $x=7$, who will
pass the ball to the cow at $x=4$, after which this ball will also cycle between
the cow at $x=3$ and the cow at $x=4$. In this way, all cows will be passed a
ball at least once (possibly by Farmer John, possibly by another cow).

It can be seen that there is no single cow to whom Farmer John could initially pass a ball
so that every cow would eventually be passed a ball.

[2025-08-24T21:08:26] thinking

**Analyzing Hoofball problem**

I’m working on the USACO "Hoofball" problem, where there are N cows each positioned at certain coordinates. Each cow passes to its nearest neighbor, and if ther
e’s a tie, it passes to the leftmost neighbor. After cows get balls from Farmer John, they keep passing according to the rules until reaching a stable cycle, ei
ther a 2-cycle or potentially larger ones. Since each cow can only pass to one neighbor, I realize the graph is functional, leading to cycles, but self-loops ca
n’t occur due to the distinct distances.
**Examining cycle dynamics**

I realize that a cow can't pass to itself, which means cycles longer than 2 aren’t possible. In a functional graph scenario, if A passes to B and B to C, it cre
ates a potential triangle, but longer cycles seem to be invalidated. Instead, mutual nearest neighbors form the only viable cycles, mostly 2-cycles. I need to e
nsure every cow receives a ball, typically giving initial balls to cows with zero in-degrees. For each special case of 2-cycles, I'll also count those that need
 additional balls. This straightforward approach leads me to calculate effectively!
**Planning solution delivery**

I'm thinking it might be best to directly present the solution plan rather than outlining it first. The user didn't specifically ask for a detailed plan, just a
 restatement and code, so I'll show the text directly and follow with the implementation.

Firstly, I'll summarize the restatement of the problem, the conceptual solution, and the pseudocode, then add that I am creating the Python implementation in `s
olution.py`. Finally, I’ll ensure that the subsequent message will include the actual code as well as the necessary operations for it.
**Finalizing code implementation**

I've structured my code to establish how each cow passes to its nearest neighbor. I first set up the list for passing, then calculate the in-degrees for each co
w. This helps me count how many cows won't receive a ball, which is essential for deriving the result. I've also included a way to identify isolated 2-cycles. T
he edge cases are covered, so I feel confident that my implementation works well overall. Now, I’m ready to proceed with applying the final solution!

1. **Problem Restatement**
Farmer John has N cows on a line at distinct positions. Each cow, upon receiving a ball, passes it to her nearest neighbor (breaking ties by choosing the leftmo
st). Farmer John can initially hand balls to any subset of cows. Find the minimum number of balls he must distribute so that every cow ends up holding a ball at
 least once.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
- Represent each cow as a node in a directed graph where an edge points to the cow’s nearest neighbor.
- Any cow with zero in-degree will never receive a ball from another cow, so each such cow needs its own initial ball.
- Mutual nearest-neighbor pairs (2-cycles) that have no other cows pointing into them (both in-degrees = 1) also need one initial ball for the pair.
- Sum those two quantities to get the answer.

3. **Pseudocode**
```
read N and list xs of positions
sort cows by position
for each cow i in sorted list:
    determine neighbor j (nearest; tie → left)
    pass_to[i] = j
compute in_deg for each cow from pass_to
result = count of cows with in_deg == 0
for each i < j where pass_to[i] == j and pass_to[j] == i:
    if in_deg[i] == 1 and in_deg[j] == 1:
        result += 1
print result
```

4. **Implemented File**
I’ve created `solution.py` with the above logic. You can run it with Python 3.
