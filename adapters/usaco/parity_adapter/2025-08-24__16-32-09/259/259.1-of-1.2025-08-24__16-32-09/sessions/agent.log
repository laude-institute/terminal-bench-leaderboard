[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Race [Brian Dean, 2013]

In order to finally settle their long-running dispute over who is the
faster cow, Bessie and her friend Elsie decide to hold a race across the farm.

The two cows start at the same location and begin running in the same
direction at the same time.  The progress of each cow is described by a
series of "segments", during each of which the cow runs at a constant
speed.  For example, Bessie might run at a speed of 5 for 3 units of time,
then at a speed of 10 for 6 units of time.  Bessie and Elsie both run for
the same total amount of time.

The cows would like your help in counting the number of leadership changes
during their race.  A leadership change happens at a point in time when cow
A pulls into the lead of cow B, whereas the last time one cow was in the
lead, it was cow B.  For example, if B is in the lead and then A pulls
ahead, then this is a leadership change.  If B is in the lead, and then A
becomes even with B for some time and then finally pulls ahead, then this
also counts as a leadership change.

PROBLEM NAME: cowrace

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.  (1 <= N, M <= 1000)

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the N segments of Bessie's
        run, described by two integers: Bessie's speed and the amount
        of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in the range
        1..1000).

* Lines 2+N..1+N+M: Each line contains one of the M segments of
        Elsie's run, described by two integers: Elsie's speed and the
        amount of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in
        the range 1..1000).

unit of time, then at a speed of 1 for 1 unit of time, and finally at a
speed of 2 for 10 units of time.  Elsie runs at a speed of 2 for 3 units of
time, then at a speed of 1 for 2 units of time, then finally at a speed of
3 for 9 units of time.  Note that both cows run for a total of 14 units of
time.

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Elsie is ahead until time t=3, when both cows meet after both have traveled
6 units of total distance and travel together for 1 unit of time.  Bessie
then pulls ahead briefly (the first leadership change), only to be
overtaken shortly thereafter by Elsie (the second leadership change). 
Elsie ends the race in the lead.

**Breaking down the task**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution and has outlined a specific process. First, I need to restate the problem in simple terms, then conceptualize a solution. After that, I’ll write pseudocode, and finally, I'll create the actual code in a file named `solution.py`. The solution involves simulating time while tracking positions based on two lists: speed and duration. Given the segments are misaligned, I need to model them piecewise within the constraints provided.
**Clarifying the simulation process**

Okay, so I've clarified that both N and M can go up to 1000, and the durations can also reach 1000, which leads to total time T being as large as 1 million. Simulating on a per-unit basis is feasible with those 1 million iterations, but it's better to handle segment overlaps. 

Using two pointers, I can advance through the segments based on the minimum of remaining durations. For each time chunk, I check the positions and determine if the leader changes. A leadership change counts when the leading cow shifts, and I need to track the previous leader carefully while considering ties. This means I’ll count leadership changes appropriately, especially when transitioning between tie and lead statuses.
**Refining the leadership change logic**

I’ve realized we're discussing the leadership logic in detail. The previous leader can be zero, and the new leader must also account for ties. I need to keep the last leader static during ties and only update it when there's an actual lead change. A leadership change happens if the new leader is different from the last leader and not zero. I've worked through examples, and I’ll implement a two-pointer technique to simulate this accurately and count leadership changes effectively. 

In the end, I’ll restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, draft the pseudocode, and create the `solution.py` file. Each part is essential for clarity and execution.
**Formulating the solution plan**

I'm setting up to create a solution plan without using a specific update method. My approach will include clear steps: restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, and writing pseudocode, then I'll use a patch to create `solution.py`. 

The pseudocode involves reading inputs, initializing necessary variables, and implementing the main logic with loops. I also need to ensure that both sequences finish simultaneously. After drafting the code, I'll conclude with a message outlining the process followed by the implementation of `solution.py`.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restatement  
   Two cows, Bessie and Elsie, run side by side with piecewise-constant speeds. We know each cow’s segments of (speed, duration), and both race for the same total time. As they run, we track their cumulative distances and count each moment one cow overtakes the other (even if they tie in between).

2. Conceptual Solution  
   - Parse both cows’ segment lists.  
   - Use two pointers to step through segments concurrently, advancing by the smaller remaining duration.  
   - Update each cow’s distance over that interval.  
   - Determine who’s leading: Bessie, Elsie, or tie.  
   - Maintain the last non-tie leader; on a new non-tie leader different from the last one, increment the leadership-change count.  
   - Continue until all segments are consumed.

3. Pseudocode  
   ```
   read N, M
   read lists bessie[], elsie[] of (speed, time)
   initialize i, j = 0
   remB, remE = bessie[0].time, elsie[0].time
   distB = distE = 0
   last_leader = 0
   lead_changes = 0

   while i < N and j < M:
       dt = min(remB, remE)
       distB += bessie[i].speed * dt
       distE += elsie[j].speed * dt
       if distB > distE: leader = 1
       elif distB < distE: leader = -1
       else: leader = 0

       if leader != 0:
           if last_leader == 0:
               last_leader = leader
           elif leader != last_leader:
               lead_changes += 1
               last_leader = leader

       remB -= dt; remE -= dt
       if remB == 0: i += 1; remB = bessie[i].time (if exists)
       if remE == 0: j += 1; remE = elsie[j].time (if exists)

   print lead_changes
   ```
