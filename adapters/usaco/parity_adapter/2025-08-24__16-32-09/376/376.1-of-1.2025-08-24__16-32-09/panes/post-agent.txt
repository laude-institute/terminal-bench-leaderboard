[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Ski Course Design [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has N hills on his farm (1 <= N <= 1,000), each with an
integer elevation in the range 0 .. 100.  In the winter, since there is
abundant snow on these hills, FJ routinely operates a ski training camp.

Unfortunately, FJ has just found out about a new tax that will be assessed
next year on farms used as ski training camps.  Upon careful reading of the
law, however, he discovers that the official definition of a ski camp
requires the difference between the highest and lowest hill on his property
to be strictly larger than 17.  Therefore, if he shortens his tallest hills
and adds mass to increase the height of his shorter hills, FJ can avoid
paying the tax as long as the new difference between the highest and lowest
hill is at most 17.

If it costs x^2 units of money to change the height of a hill by x units,
what is the minimum amount of money FJ will need to pay?  FJ is only
willing to change the height of each hill by an integer amount.

PROBLEM NAME: skidesign

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the elevation of a single hill.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5
20
4
1
24
21

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's farm has 5 hills, with elevations 1, 4, 20, 21, and 24.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum amount FJ needs to pay to modify the elevations
        of his hills so the difference between largest and smallest is
        at most 17 units.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

18

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ keeps the hills of heights 4, 20, and 21 as they are.  He adds mass to the
hill of height 1, bringing it to height 4 (cost = 3^2 = 9).  He shortens
the hill of height 24 to height 21, also at a cost of 3^2 = 9.

**Reasoning Python solution**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution, and first, I need to break down the problem in simple terms. I want to find the minimum cost to adjust hills so the
 difference between the highest and lowest heights is no more than 17. I can choose an interval and adjust heights outside that interval, with costs computed as
 the square of the difference. After forming a plan and pseudocode, I’ll save the final solution in a file named solution.py. The calculations should be managea
ble within the constraints.
**Developing the solution**

I need to create pseudocode and then implement the code in a file named solution.py. The instructions lay out four clear steps: restate the problem, conceptuali
ze the solution, write the pseudocode, and save the final solution. While a detailed plan isn't specified, I can still organize the response accordingly.

I'll provide the restatement, the conceptual breakdown, and the pseudocode, then save everything as solution.py. The code will read inputs and calculate the min
imum cost of height adjustments for the hills based on the specified constraints. Let's get started!

**Problem Restatement**
Given N hills with integer elevations, adjust each hill’s height by an integer amount (cost = (change)²) so that after adjustments, the difference between the h
ighest and lowest hill is at most 17. Compute the minimum total cost.

**Solution Concept**
- We can slide a 17-unit window across possible elevation ranges [low, low+17], from low=0 to 83.
- For each window, hills below `low` are raised to `low`, and hills above `low+17` are lowered to `low+17`.
- Sum the squared differences (cost) for all hills, and take the minimum over all windows.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read list of hills
min_cost = infinity
for low from 0 to 83:
    high = low + 17
    cost = 0
    for each hill h:
        if h < low:
            cost += (low - h)^2
        else if h > high:
            cost += (h - high)^2
    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
print min_cost
```

I've saved the implementation as `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests!
