[BEGIN PROBLEM]

With the hottest recorded summer ever at Farmer John's farm, he needs a way to
cool down his cows. Thus, he decides to invest in some air conditioners.

Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 20$) live in a barn that contains a
sequence of stalls in a row, numbered $1 \ldots 100$.  Cow $i$ occupies a range
of  these stalls, starting from stall $s_i$ and ending with stall $t_i$.  The
ranges of stalls occupied by different cows are all disjoint from each-other.
Cows have different cooling requirements.  Cow $i$ must be cooled by an amount
$c_i$, meaning every stall occupied by cow $i$ must have its temperature reduced
by at least $c_i$ units.

The barn contains $M$ air conditioners, labeled $1 \ldots M$
($1 \leq M \leq 10$). The $i$th air conditioner costs $m_i$ units of money to
operate ($1 \leq m_i \leq 1000$) and cools the range of stalls starting from
stall $a_i$ and ending with stall $b_i$.  If running, the $i$th air conditioner
reduces the temperature of all the stalls in this range by $p_i$
($1 \leq p_i \leq 10^6$).  Ranges of stalls covered by air conditioners may
potentially overlap.

Running a farm is no easy business, so FJ has a tight budget. Please determine
the minimum amount of money he needs to spend to keep all of his cows
comfortable. It is guaranteed that if FJ uses all of his conditioners, then all
cows will be comfortable.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains $N$ and $M$.

The next $N$ lines describe cows.  The $i$th of these lines contains $s_i$,
$t_i$, and $c_i$.

The next $M$ lines describe air conditioners.  The $i$th of these lines contains
$a_i$, $b_i$, $p_i$, and $m_i$.

For every input other than the sample, you can assume that $M = 10$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer telling the minimum amount of money FJ needs to spend to
operate enough air conditioners to satisfy all his cows (with the conditions
listed above).


SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
1 5 2
7 9 3
2 9 2 3
1 6 2 8
1 2 4 2
6 9 1 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10

One possible solution that results in the least amount of money spent is to
select those that cool the intervals $[2, 9]$, $[1, 2]$, and $[6, 9]$, for a
cost of $3 + 2 + 5 = 10$.

1. Problem Restatement
- We have up to 20 cows, each occupying a distinct interval of stalls [s_i, t_i] on a barn (stalls numbered 1–100). Cow i needs at least c_i units of cooling at
 every stall she occupies.
- There are up to 10 air conditioners; AC j covers [a_j, b_j], provides p_j units of cooling to each stall in that range, and costs m_j to run.
- Choose a subset of ACs so that every cow’s stalls receive at least her required cooling, minimizing total cost.

2. Solution Concept
- Brute‐force all subsets of the M ≤ 10 air conditioners (2^M ≤ 1024 possibilities).
- For each subset:
  - Sum its cost; skip if already no better than best found.
  - Build an array `cooling[1..100]` by adding each selected AC’s power over its range.
  - Verify every cow’s stalls all have `cooling ≥ c_i`.
  - If valid, update the minimum cost.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, M
read list of cows (s, t, c)
read list of ACs (a, b, p, m)
best_cost = ∞

for mask in 0 .. (1<<M)-1:
    total_cost = sum of m_j for each j in mask
    if total_cost ≥ best_cost: continue

    cooling = [0]*101
    for j in mask:
        for s in a_j .. b_j:
            cooling[s] += p_j

    if for every cow all cooling[s] ≥ c_i:
        best_cost = total_cost

print(best_cost)
```

The file `solution.py` has been created with the above implementation. It reads from stdin, brute‐forces subsets, and prints the minimum cost.
