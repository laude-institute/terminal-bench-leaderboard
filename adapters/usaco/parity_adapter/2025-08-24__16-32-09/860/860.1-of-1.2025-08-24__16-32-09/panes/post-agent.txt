[BEGIN PROBLEM]
With plenty of free time on their hands (or rather, hooves), the cows on Farmer
John's farm often pass the time by playing video games.  One of their favorites
is based on a popular human video game called Puyo Puyo; the cow version is of
course called Mooyo Mooyo.

The game of Mooyo Mooyo is played on a tall narrow grid $N$ cells tall
($1 \leq N \leq 100$) and 10 cells wide.  Here is an example with $N = 6$:


0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054502230
2211122220
1111111223

Each cell is either empty (indicated by a 0), or a haybale in one of nine
different colors (indicated by characters 1..9).  Gravity causes haybales to
fall downward, so there is never a 0 cell below a haybale.

Two cells belong to the same connected region if they are directly adjacent
either horizontally or vertically, and they have the same nonzero color.  Any
time a connected region exists with at least $K$ cells, its haybales all
disappear, turning into zeros.  If multiple such connected regions exist at the
same time, they all disappear simultaneously.  Afterwards, gravity might cause
haybales to fall downward to fill some of the resulting cells that became zeros.
In the resulting configuration, there may again be connected regions of size at
least $K$ cells.  If so, they also disappear (simultaneously, if there are
multiple such regions), then gravity pulls the remaining cells downward, and the
process repeats until no connected regions of size at least $K$ exist.

Given the state of a Mooyo Mooyo board, please output a final picture of the
board after these operations have occurred.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 10N$). The
remaining $N$ lines specify the initial state of the board.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output $N$ lines, describing a picture of the final board state.

SAMPLE INPUT:
6 3
0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054502230
2211122220
1111111223
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000000
2254500000

In the example above, if $K = 3$, then there is a connected region of size at
least $K$ with color 1 and also one with color 2.  Once these are simultaneously
removed, the board temporarily looks like this:


0000000000
0000000300
0054000300
1054500030
2200000000
0000000003

Then, gravity takes effect and the haybales drop to this configuration:


0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000300
2254500333

Again, there is a region of size at least $K$ (with color 3).  Removing it
yields the final board configuration:


0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1054000000
2254500000

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T21:26:56] thinking

**Explaining the problem-solving process**

I need to implement a solution for the Mooyo Mooyo game. First, I'll restate the problem in plain English: we're looking to find connected groups of blocks of s
ize K or larger, remove them, and then have the remaining blocks fall down to fill any gaps.

Next, I'll outline a conceptual solution and then create pseudocode. Finally, I’ll write everything up in a Python file named solution.py. Since it’s straightfo
rward, I won't create a complex plan but deliver each step clearly.
**Creating a pseudocode solution**

I need to write out a solution for the Mooyo Mooyo problem and save it as solution.py with no outside libraries.

First, I'll restate the problem: find and remove connected components of at least size K from a grid. Next, I’ll provide a conceptual solution, followed by pseu
docode.

Then, I’ll create solution.py, ensuring it includes all steps: reading input dimensions, defining directions, running BFS/DFS for connected components, checking
 sizes for removal, managing gravity, and finally outputting the modified grid. I'll use iterative BFS to avoid recursion issues. After that, I'll apply the pat
ch to add the file.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restated the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualized a flood-fill and gravity loop solution
3. Provided concise pseudocode
4. Implemented and saved it as **solution.py**

Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or adjust anything!
