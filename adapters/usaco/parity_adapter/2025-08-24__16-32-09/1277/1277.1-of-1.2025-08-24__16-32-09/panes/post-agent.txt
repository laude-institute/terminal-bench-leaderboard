Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Because Bessie is bored of playing with her usual text string where the only
characters are 'C,' 'O,' and 'W,' Farmer John gave her $Q$ new strings
($1 \leq Q \leq 100$), where the only characters are 'M' and 'O.' Bessie's
favorite word out of the characters 'M' and 'O' is obviously "MOO," so she wants
to turn each of the $Q$ strings into "MOO" using the following operations:

Replace either the first or last character with its opposite (so that 'M'
becomes 'O' and 'O' becomes 'M'). Delete either the first or last character.
Unfortunately, Bessie is lazy and does not want to perform more operations than
absolutely necessary. For each string, please help her determine the minimum
number of operations necessary to form "MOO" or output $-1$ if this is
impossible.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $Q$.

The next $Q$ lines of input each consist of a string, each of its characters
either 'M' or 'O'. Each string has at least 1 and at most 100 characters.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the answer for each input string on a separate line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
MOMMOM
MMO
MOO
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
-1
0

A sequence of $4$ operations transforming the first string into "MOO" is as
follows:


Replace the last character with O (operation 1)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)

The second string cannot be transformed into "MOO." The third string is already
"MOO," so no operations need to be performed.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: Every string has length at most $3$.Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

**Transforming a substring**

I need to transform a substring of length L into "MOO." Since we can only flip the ends, any substring selected must include the middle character 'O' when L is
larger than 2. Ultimately, I want the substring to have a final length of 3. So, I’ll focus on selecting substrings of length 3. For each substring, I can calcu
late the necessary deletions. It turns out that the total deletions required will always equal n - 3.
**Calculating operations for substring changes**

The total cost involves deletions, which are always n - 3, plus any necessary flips. However, if the string length is less than 3, it’s impossible to create a l
ength of 3 through deletions, resulting in an answer of -1. For valid strings of length 3 or more, I focus on minimizing flips for substrings of that length. If
 any substring's middle character isn’t 'O', I can skip it. The flips required for both ends determine my total operations: n - 3 plus the flips calculated for
changing the ends to make the substring match "MOO."
**Implementing the algorithm**

The algorithm looks solid: for each string, I’ll check if its length is less than 3; if so, I’ll output -1. Otherwise, I’ll iterate through each substring of le
ngth 3. If the middle character is 'O', I’ll tally up the necessary flips to convert the ends into the right characters. My goal is to keep minimal flips and ca
lculate the total operations accordingly.

I'll produce the pseudocode and implement it in a new file, `solution.py`, ensuring it reads from standard input and outputs the answers correctly.

[2025-08-24T20:39:25] codex

Here’s the complete solution.

1. Restated:
   - Given strings of ‘M’ and ‘O’, you can delete or flip (M↔O) only at the ends.
   - Find the fewest operations to reach exactly “MOO” or report –1 if impossible.

2. Conceptual solution:
   - Any final string of length 3 must be a contiguous substring of the original after deletions.
   - Deletions needed = original length – 3.
   - For each length-3 window, ensure the middle is ‘O’ (can’t be changed), count flips for first/last to match “M”/“O”.
   - Take the minimum flips over all windows and add deletions. If no valid window, answer –1.

3. Pseudocode:
   ```
   for each string s:
     if len(s)<3: print -1
     else:
       best = ∞
       for each i from 0 to len(s)-3:
         sub = s[i:i+3]
         if sub[1]=='O':
           flips = (sub[0]!='M') + (sub[2]!='O')
           best = min(best, flips)
       if best==∞: print -1
       else: print (len(s)-3)+best
   ```
