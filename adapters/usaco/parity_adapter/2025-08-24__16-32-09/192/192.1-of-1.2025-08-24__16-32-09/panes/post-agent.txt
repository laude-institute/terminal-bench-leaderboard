Problem 3: Balanced Cow Breeds [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John usually brands his cows with a circular mark, but his branding
iron is broken, so he instead must settle for branding each cow with a mark
in the shape of a parenthesis -- (.  He has two breeds of cows on his farm:
Holsteins and Guernseys.  He brands each of his cows with a
parenthesis-shaped mark.  Depending on which direction the cow is facing,
this might look like either a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis.

FJ's N cows are all standing in a row, each facing an arbitrary direction,
so the marks on the cows look like a string of parentheses of length N.
Looking at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please
help FJ compute the number of possible ways he could assign breeds to his N
cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: bbreeds

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of length N (1 <= N <= 1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

(())

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the number of ways FJ can
        assign breeds to cows so that the Holsteins form a balanced
        subsequence of parentheses, and likewise for the Guernseys.
        Since the answer might be a very large number, please print
        the remainder of this number when divided by 2012 (i.e., print
        the number mod 2012).  Breed assignments involving only one
        breed type are valid.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The following breed assignments work:

(())
HHHH

(())
GGGG

(())
HGGH

(())
GHHG

(())
HGHG

(())
GHGH

**Solving the Balanced Cow Breeds Problem**

I need to tackle the Balanced Cow Breeds problem by first restating it clearly. The goal is to assign each position in a parentheses string to either breed H or
 G while ensuring that both breeds have balanced subsequences.

Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution in simple terms and craft pseudocode. Since this is a dynamic programming issue, I’ll keep in mind the limitations: no ext
ernal libraries are allowed, the total number of positions won't exceed 1000, and results need to be taken modulo 2012. Then, I’ll save the working code as solu
tion.py.
**Counting Balanced Assignments**

I need to count the assignments for breeds H and G in a way that ensures both have balanced parentheses subsequences. This means for breed H, as I scan the stri
ng, the open and close counts should match, and for G, it should be the same. I need to use dynamic programming, keeping track of current balances for both bree
ds.

Given that the string can be arbitrary, it's ambiguous if it’s originally balanced. I must consider that the string is fixed in terms of parentheses, despite no
t being explicitly balanced.
**Implementing the Solution**

I'm working on applying mod 2012 for the code, ensuring it's clear and uses local variables for readability. I have to write a function, `main()`, to read input
 and calculate the global balance step by step using an array for dynamic programming.

The code uses O(n^2) complexity, which seems reasonable. However, I see a small opportunity for improvement in how the loops work. I’ll make sure conditions rem
ain logical and handle edge cases properly. Finally, I’ll prepare for the patch by structuring my findings into sections for clarity.

**Problem Restatement**
Given a parentheses string of length N, assign each character to one of two breeds (H or G) so that the subsequence seen by each breed is itself a balanced pare
ntheses string. Count the number of valid assignments modulo 2012.

**Solution Concept**
- Let `s` be the input string.
- Track a single “global” balance (`gbal`) = # of '(' minus # of ')' processed so far; the string must end with `gbal=0` or answer 0.
- For Holsteins (H), maintain a balance `h` as we scan; Guernseys (G) then have balance `g = gbal - h`.
- Use DP over prefixes and possible `h` balances:
  dp[i][h] = ways after i chars with H-balance = h (and implicit G-balance ≥0).
- Transitions on '(' always add +1 to whichever breed you assign it; on ')' subtract, guarding against negative balances.
- Only 1D DP array (`dp_prev`) needed since `gbal` is known, reducing state from O(N²) to O(N²) with just one dimension of size O(N).

**Pseudocode**
```
read s
n = len(s); MOD = 2012
dp_prev = array of size n+1, dp_prev[0]=1
gbal = 0

for each char c in s:
  dp_curr = zero array size n+1
  if c=='(':
    for h in 0..gbal:
      v = dp_prev[h]
      dp_curr[h+1] += v        # assign to H
      dp_curr[h]   += v        # assign to G
    gbal +=1
  else:  # c==')'
    for h in 0..gbal:
      v = dp_prev[h]
      if h>0: dp_curr[h-1] += v        # H can close
      if (gbal - h)>0: dp_curr[h] += v # G can close
    gbal -=1
  take dp_curr mod and set dp_prev=dp_curr

if gbal!=0: print 0
else: print dp_prev[0] mod MOD
```
