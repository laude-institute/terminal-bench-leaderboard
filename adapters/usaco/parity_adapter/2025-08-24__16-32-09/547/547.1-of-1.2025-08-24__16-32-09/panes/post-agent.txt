[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has received a shipment of $N$ large hay bales ($1 \le N \le 4000$)
and placed them at various locations along the road leading to his barn.
Unfortunately, he completely forgets that Bessie the cow is out grazing along
the road, and she may now be trapped within the bales!
Each bale $j$ has a size $S_j$ and a distinct position $P_j$ giving its location
along the one-dimensional road.  Bessie the cow starts at some location where
there is no hay bale, and can move around freely along the road, even up to the
position at which a bale is located, but she cannot cross through this position.
As an exception, if she runs in the same direction for $D$ units of distance,
she builds up enough speed to break through and permanently eliminate any hay
bale of size strictly less than $D$.  Of course, after doing this, she
might open up more space to allow her to make a run at other hay bales,
eliminating them as well.
Bessie can escape to freedom if she can eventually break through either the
leftmost or rightmost hay bale.  Please compute the total area of the road
consisting of real-valued starting positions from which Bessie cannot escape.
For example, if Bessie cannot escape if she starts between hay bales at
positions 1 and 5, then these encompass an area of size 4 from which she  cannot
escape.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines describes a
bale, and contains two integers giving its size and position, each in the range
$1\ldots 10^9$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single integer, giving the area of the road from which Bessie cannot
escape.

**Understanding the hay bale problem**

The user is asking for a Python 3 solution to a problem involving Bessie and hay bales in a 1D corridor. The key constraints are that the number of bales can be
 up to 4000, and we need to calculate starting positions where Bessie can’t escape due to the bales' sizes and positions.

I think we might use a two-pointer approach or track intervals of trapped positions. We need to define the logic clearly with pseudocode first before writing th
e actual implementation.
**Defining break conditions**

I’m outlining the break conditions for Bessie as she runs in one direction for a distance D. She needs an empty segment longer than D to break through a bale. S
pecifically, we’re looking for "trapped intervals" between pairs of bales. For bales \(i\) and \(j\), they can trap Bessie if the distance between them is great
er than their sizes.

For her to be trapped, both bales must have sizes that are at least equal to the distance between them, preventing her from breaking free.
**Drafting the solution**

I need to focus on implementing a Python solution for the hay bale problem. The approach involves calculating intervals based on the conditions surrounding the
bales and checking their sizes. The two-pointer approach will help optimize performance.

I’ll follow a clear structure: first, I'll restate the problem, then conceptualize the solution, write pseudocode, and finally implement the solution in a Pytho
n file called solution.py. I want to ensure the explanation is natural and flows well while avoiding excessive formatting. Let’s get to it!

**Restatement**

We have N hay bales on a 1D road at distinct integer positions. Each bale at position P_j has size S_j. Bessie starts somewhere not occupied by a bale and can m
ove freely until blocked by a bale. If she can sprint D units in one direction without hitting another bale, she can break any bale of size < D. Once broken, th
at bale is removed and she may attempt to break others. She escapes if she eventually breaks through the leftmost or rightmost bale. We need the total length of
 starting positions (real values) from which she cannot escape.

---

**Solution Approach**

1. Sort bales by position.
2. Any two bales i<j trap Bessie between them exactly when neither can be broken by a run across the gap:
   - gap = P[j]–P[i]
   - require S[i] ≥ gap and S[j] ≥ gap
   If so, the entire interval [P[i], P[j]] is sealed off.
3. Enumerate all such trapping pairs in O(N²), but for each i stop scanning j once gap > S[i] (further gaps only grow).
4. Collect all trapped intervals [P[i], P[j]], sort them, and merge overlaps to compute the union length.
5. That merged total is the answer.

---

**Pseudocode**

```
read N
read list of (size, pos)
sort bales by pos
intervals = []
for i in [0..N-2]:
    for j in [i+1..N-1]:
        gap = pos[j] - pos[i]
        if gap > size[i]:
            break
        if size[j] >= gap:
            intervals.append((pos[i], pos[j]))
if intervals empty:
    print 0 and exit
sort intervals by start
total = 0
cur_start, cur_end = intervals[0]
for (s,e) in intervals[1:]:
    if s > cur_end:
        total += cur_end - cur_start
        cur_start, cur_end = s, e
    else:
        cur_end = max(cur_end, e)
total += cur_end - cur_start
print total
```
