[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John realizes that the income he receives from milk production is
insufficient to fund the growth of his farm, so to earn some extra money, he
launches a cow-rental service, which he calls "USACOW" (pronounced "Use-a-cow").

Farmer John has $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), each capable of producing
some amount of milk every day.  The $M$ stores near FJ's farm
($1 \leq M \leq 100,000$) each offer to buy a certain amount of milk at a
certain price.  Moreover, Farmer John's $R$ ($1 \leq R \leq 100,000$)
neighboring farmers are each interested in renting a cow at a certain price.

Farmer John has to choose whether each cow should be milked or rented to a
nearby farmer.  Help him find the maximum amount of money he can make per day.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line in the input contains $N$, $M$, and $R$. The next $N$ lines each
contain an integer $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 1,000,000$),  indicating that Farmer
John's $i$th cow can produce $c_i$ gallons of milk every day. The next $M$ lines
each contain two integers $q_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \leq q_i, p_i \leq 1,000,000$),
indicating that the $i$th store is willing to buy up to $q_i$ gallons of milk
for $p_i$ cents per gallon.  Keep in mind that Farmer John can sell any amount
of milk between zero and $q_i$ gallons to a given store. The next $R$ lines each
contain an integer $r_i$ ($1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000$), indicating that one of
Farmer John's neighbors wants to rent a cow for $r_i$ cents per day.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of one line containing the maximum profit Farmer John
can make per day by milking or renting out each of his cows.  Note that the
output might be too large to fit into a standard 32-bit integer, so you may need
to use a larger integer type like a "long long" in C/C++.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
6
2
4
7
1
10 25
2 10
15 15
250
80
100
40
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
725

Farmer John should milk cows #1 and #4, to produce 13 gallons of milk.  He
should completely fill the order for 10 gallons, earning 250 cents, and sell the
remaining three gallons at 15 cents each, for a total of 295 cents of milk
profits.

Then, he should rent out the other three cows for 250, 80, and 100 cents, to
earn 430 more cents.  (He should leave the request for a 40-cent rental
unfilled.)  This is a total of 725 cents of daily profit.

[2025-08-24T21:03:19] thinking

**Analyzing the rental service problem**

I’m considering the USACO "Rental Service" problem using a greedy approach. We have a number of cows with different production rates, stores offering prices for
 purchasing cows, and rental options as well. Each cow can either be milked or rented out for profit. The goal is to maximize profit by selecting the highest pr
oducing cows for milking and the lowest producing cows for renting. I plan to sort cows by production and rentals by price to find the optimal solution.
**Optimizing rental profits**

I’m focusing on minimizing opportunity costs by renting out the worst milkers—cows with the lowest production. First, I'll sort the cow production array in asce
nding order. I need to compute rental profits with prefix sums, sorting those rental prices in descending order. For maximum profit, I’ll consider renting up to
 a certain number of cows while maximizing milk production from the highest producers. The next step would be to sort the stores by price to optimize milk selli
ng, ensuring that I have all necessary prefix sums precomputed for efficiency.
**Preparing the final solution**

I’m now ready to compute the total milk profit and maximize the profits from rentals. For each possible number of rented cows, I’ll compute the milk profit usin
g binary search on the store prefix quantities. I need to consider edge cases, like when rentals are fewer than available cows. I’ll implement this with careful
 reading of inputs, sorting, and prefix sums. Finally, I’ll create the solution.py file as requested, using a straightforward step-by-step approach. Let’s final
ize everything!

[2025-08-24T21:03:45] codex

I’ve added `solution.py` with a complete Python 3 implementation that:

- Sorts cows by production.
- Precomputes milk-suffix sums for top milkers.
- Sorts stores by price and builds prefix quantities and revenues.
- Sorts rentals and builds a prefix-sum of rental incomes.
- Iterates over the number of cows rented, computing milk-sale profit via binary search and adding rental profit.
- Outputs the maximum total.

Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or adjustments!
