[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John, desperate to win the award for best cow photographer at the county
fair, is trying to take the perfect photograph of his $N$ cows
($2 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$, $N$ even).

Farmer John owns cows of two potential breeds: Guernseys and Holsteins.
To make his photo as aesthetic as possible, he wants to line up his
cows so that as many Guernseys are in even-numbered positions in the line
as possible (the first position in the line is an odd position, the next is
an even position, and so on). Due to his lack of strong
communication with his cows, the only way he can achieve his goal is by asking
even length "prefixes" of his cows to reverse themselves (a prefix
consists of the range of cows from the first cow up to the $j$th cow
for some position $j$).

Please count the minimum number of reversals required for Farmer John to achieve
his goal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $N$.

The second line contains a string of length $N,$ specifying the initial ordering
of the cows from left to right. Each 'H' represents a Holstein, while each 'G'
represents a Guernsey.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the minimum number of reversals needed on a single line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
14
GGGHGHHGHHHGHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, it suffices to reverse the prefix consisting of the first six
cows.


   GGGHGHHGHHHGHG (Before)
-> HGHGGGHGHHHGHG (After)

Before the reversal, four Guernseys were at even positions. After the reversal,
six Guernseys are at even positions. It is impossible for there to be more than
six Guernseys at even positions.

SCORING:
Test cases 2-6 satisfy $N\le 1000$.Test cases 7-11 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Analyzing G positioning**

I'm trying to maximize Gs in even positions with a target equal to the minimum of K and half of N. To achieve this, I need minimal reversals. I've noticed that
reversing an even-length prefix flips the original positions, changing their parity. This means Gs in even indices shift to odd ones and vice versa. I understan
d that elements beyond the reversal remain unchanged, so focused operations can help with efficient positioning to achieve my target of Gs in even spots.
**Exploring G changes in positions**

I'm looking at how the number of Gs changes in even positions after a reversal. I define values for Gs in even and odd positions in the prefix. The change, Δ, d
epends on how many Gs shift between odd and even positions. To hit my target, T, I need Δ to meet a specific condition.

I'll consider the total Gs and choose an appropriate even prefix length. The goal is to either reach T in one or two reversals, since that’s often enough to ach
ieve the necessary adjustments without overshooting.
**Finalizing the algorithm**

I’m working on an algorithm around the number of Gs in certain positions. For D=3 and j=6, I found that using a specific j maximizes my change in G positioning,
 but alternating patterns present challenges. If I can't achieve my target with one operation due to a mismatch, I realize two operations might be necessary. I
need to implement everything efficiently, using prefix sums while considering memory constraints. Now, I’ll outline the solution in simple English, describe the
 approach, provide pseudocode, and then create the actual code as requested.

1. Problem Restatement
Farmer John has an even-length line of cows, each labeled ‘G’ or ‘H’. He wants as many ‘G’ cows as possible to occupy the even-numbered positions (2, 4,  …). Th
e only move allowed is reversing a prefix of even length. Find the minimum number of such reversals needed to reach the maximum possible number of ‘G’s in even
slots.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Let N be the length and K the total number of ‘G’s. The best you can do is put min(K, N/2) ‘G’s into even positions; call that target T.
- Count how many ‘G’s are already in even positions; call that c. If c == T, zero reversals are needed.
- A single reversal of an even-length prefix of length j moves every ‘G’ that was in an even slot in that prefix to an odd slot, and every ‘G’ in an odd slot to
 an even slot. The net gain in even-slot ‘G’s is (odd_prefix_G – even_prefix_G).
- Precompute prefix counts of ‘G’s in odd and even slots. For each even j, compute Δ = odd_prefix_G[j] – even_prefix_G[j]. If c + Δ == T for some j, one reversa
l suffices.
- Otherwise, two reversals always suffice (first an all-length reversal, then a tailored one).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read S   # length-N string
K = count of ‘G’ in S
T = min(K, N//2)
c = count of ‘G’ at even positions in S
if c == T:
    print 0; exit
build two arrays oddP and evenP of length N
for i in [0..N-1]:
    oddP[i]  = oddP[i-1]  + (S[i]=='G' and (i+1)%2==1)
    evenP[i] = evenP[i-1] + (S[i]=='G' and (i+1)%2==0)
D = T - c
for j in [2,4,6,…,N]:
    pe = evenP[j-1]
    po = oddP[j-1]
    if po - pe == D:
        print 1; exit
print 2
```

4. solution.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    S = data[1].strip()
    # total G count and target
    K = S.count('G')
    T = min(K, N // 2)
    # current Gs in even positions
    c = sum(1 for i, ch in enumerate(S) if ch == 'G' and (i+1) % 2 == 0)
    if c == T:
        print(0)
        return
    # build prefix sums
    oddP = [0] * N
    evenP = [0] * N
    for i, ch in enumerate(S):
        isG = (ch == 'G')
        oddP[i]  = oddP[i-1]  + (1 if isG and (i+1)%2==1 else 0) if i>0 else (1 if isG and (i+1)%2==1 else 0)
        evenP[i] = evenP[i-1] + (1 if isG and (i+1)%2==0 else 0) if i>0 else (1 if isG and (i+1)%2==0 else 0)
    # desired gain
    D = T - c
    # try one reversal
    for j in range(2, N+1, 2):
        pe = evenP[j-1]
        po = oddP[j-1]
        if po - pe == D:
