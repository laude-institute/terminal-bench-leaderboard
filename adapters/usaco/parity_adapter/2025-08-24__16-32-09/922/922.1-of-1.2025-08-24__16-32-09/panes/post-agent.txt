[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie and Elsie are helping Farmer John wash the dishes, a more complicated
process than one might think due to their lack of opposable thumbs.

The two cows decide that Bessie will apply soap, and Elsie will rinse. Bessie is
given a dirty stack of plates labeled $1$ through $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$)
Elsie has an empty stack, where clean plates will go. There is a counter in
between Bessie and Elsie for soapy stacks.

At each step, either:

Bessie takes a plate from the top of the dirty stack, applies soap, and then
places it on the counter. When placing a soapy plate on the counter, Bessie must
either (i) place the plate on top of an existing non-empty soapy stack or (ii)
create a new soapy stack to the right of all existing soapy stacks.

Elsie takes a plate from the top of the leftmost soapy stack. Elsie rinses the
plate, then places it on top of the clean stack.

The goal is for the clean stack to have all plates in order, with the smallest
label on the bottom and the largest label on the top.  It may not be possible
for the cows to achieve this goal for the entire stack of plates, so please
determine the length of the largest prefix of the input ordering for which the
goal is achievable.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines specify the order of
the dishes in Bessie's stack, with the first number being the dish on top of the
stack.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the length of the longest prefix of the input stack that can be
successfully washed so that the plates end up ordered properly in the clean
stack.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5

[2025-08-24T20:42:46] thinking

**Analyzing plate sorting process**

I'm diving into a specific problem: Bessie is applying soap to plates and stacking them on the counter. She can either start a new stack or add to an existing o
ne. Meanwhile, Elsie rinses plates from the leftmost soapy stack into a clean stack that needs to be sorted consecutively from 1 to k. I’m considering the longe
st prefix to determine how we can create this sorted stack, and I see it connecting to patterns in patience sorting and increasing sequences.
**Exploring optimal washing strategy**

I'm analyzing a problem where Bessie and Elsie coordinate actions during dishwashing. The goal is to ensure a clean stack sorted from 1 at the bottom to k above
, but Elsie can only rinse from the top of the leftmost non-empty soapy stack. Bessie needs to minimize the number of stacks while maximizing the usability of t
hose stacks by arranging plates strategically. The challenge seems similar to the "Dish Washing" problem from USACO Gold, where stacks need to be managed carefu
lly to allow for optimal rinsing. I’ll explore maintaining a sequence of stacks to facilitate this.
**Understanding prefix sorting conditions**

I'm exploring how to manage the dishwashing process so that Elsie can rinse plates in the correct order. The key point is that the tops of the stacks must incre
ase from left to right; otherwise, they might block each other. To create a clean stack from sorted plates, I need Bessie to place plates in such a way that all
ows the desired output. Each time a plate is added or rinsed, it must follow the rules of patience sorting, ensuring stacks are in the correct order for efficie
nt rinsing. The challenge is to maintain an arrangement where Elsie can continuously access the plates from the leftmost stack.
**Planning and simulating the plate rinsing process**

I'm examining the efficiency of the dishwashing algorithm. In the worst-case scenario, we could face O(L^2) complexity, especially if the inputs come in decreas
ing order. The key is to manage stacks effectively while allowing for optimal rinsing using data structures that track stack tops. I’m considering various techn
iques, such as using a deque or maintaining an offset index to skip empty stacks, which could help streamline the process. I need to simulate the rinsing and so
aking correctly while ensuring the sequence remains sortable. Let's refine the approach with binary search and verify the results through careful coding.

Here’s a Python 3 script that:

- Reads N and the plate labels.
- Binary-searches the longest prefix L that can be fully soaped & rinsed into a sorted clean stack.
- For each candidate L, simulates:
  • Soaping: placing each plate into the leftmost soapy stack whose top > plate (or starting a new stack).
  • Rinsing: whenever the top of the leftmost stack equals the current global minimum of un-rinsed plates, pop it.
- Checks if all L plates can be processed.

It runs in about O(N log² N), uses only the standard library, and saves to `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like tests or tweaks!
