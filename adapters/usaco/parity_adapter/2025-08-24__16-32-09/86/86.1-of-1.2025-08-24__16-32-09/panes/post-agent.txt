[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Moo Sick [Rob Seay]

Everyone knows that cows love to listen to all forms of music.  Almost all
forms, that is -- the great cow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Moozart
once discovered that a specific chord tends to make cows rather ill.  This
chord, known as the ruminant seventh chord, is therefore typically avoided
in all cow musical compositions.

Farmer John, not knowing the finer points of cow musical history, decides
to play his favorite song over the loudspeakers in the barn.  Your task is
to identify all the ruminant seventh chords in this song, to estimate how
sick it will make the cows.

The song played by FJ is a series of N (1 <= N <= 20,000) notes, each an
integer in the range 1..88.  A ruminant seventh chord is specified by a
sequence of C (1 <= C <= 10) distinct notes, also integers in the range
1..88.  However, even if these notes are transposed (increased or decreased
by a common amount), or re-ordered, the chord remains a ruminant seventh
chord!  For example, if "4 6 7" is a ruminant seventh chord, then "3 5 6"
(transposed by -1), "6 8 9" (transposed by +2), "6 4 7" (re-ordered), and
"5 3 6" (transposed and re-ordered) are also ruminant seventh chords.

A ruminant seventh chord is a sequence of C consecutive notes satisfying
the above criteria. It is therefore uniquely determined by its starting
location in the song. Please determine the indices of the starting
locations of all of the ruminant seventh chords.

PROBLEM NAME: moosick

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N.

* Lines 2..1+N: The N notes in FJ's song, one note per line.

* Line 2+N: A single integer: C.

* Lines 3+N..2+N+C: The C notes in an example of a ruminant seventh
        chord.  All transpositions and/or re-orderings of these notes
        are also ruminant seventh chords.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
1
8
5
7
9
10
3
4
6
7

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's song is 1,8,5,7,9,10.  A ruminant seventh chord is some
transposition/re-ordering of 4,6,7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A count, K, of the number of ruminant seventh chords that
        appear in FJ's song.  Observe that different instances of
        ruminant seventh chords can overlap each-other.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line specifies the starting index of a ruminant
        seventh chord (index 1 is the first note in FJ's song, index N
        is the last).  Indices should be listed in increasing sorted
        order.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2
2
4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Two ruminant seventh chords appear in FJ's song (and these occurrences
actually overlap by one note).  The first is 8,5,7 (transposed by +1 and
reordered) starting at index 2, and the second is 7,9,10 (transposed by +3)
starting at index 4.

**Analyzing song patterns**

I'm working on a problem involving a song with up to 20,000 notes and chords of up to 10 distinct notes. The goal is to find starting positions where segments o
f the song match a specified chord, accounting for transpositions and reorderings. I need to identify windows within the song that correspond to the chord notes
 after a uniform shift. I realize there may be duplicates in the song, which complicates matching. I'll need to establish if a consistent delta exists for these
 notes to match the chord set.
**Developing a solution approach**

I'm figuring out how to compare a song's notes against a specified chord to see if they match in a transposed and reordered fashion. My plan is to sort the note
s of the chord and calculate a normalized pattern of differences. Then, for each window in the song, I’ll sort the notes, calculate differences, and compare the
m to the chord's pattern.

I need to ensure there are no duplicates, as that could cause misleading zeros in my differences. I'll also restate the problem, conceptualize my solution, draf
t pseudocode, and organize everything neatly into a Python file.

1. Restatement
Everyone plays a song (a list of N integer notes). A “ruminant seventh chord” is any length-C segment whose notes, when sorted and shifted by a constant, match
the given C-note pattern (order and absolute pitch don’t matter). Find all starting indices of such segments.

2. Concept
• Normalize the pattern by sorting its notes and recording differences from its minimum.
• For each consecutive window of size C in the song, sort it, compute its differences from its minimum, and compare to the pattern’s normalized differences.
• If equal, record the 1-based start index.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read song[N]
read C
read chord[C]
chord_sorted = sort(chord)
