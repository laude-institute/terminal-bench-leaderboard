Problem 3: Moo Sick [Rob Seay]

Everyone knows that cows love to listen to all forms of music.  Almost all
forms, that is -- the great cow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Moozart
once discovered that a specific chord tends to make cows rather ill.  This
chord, known as the ruminant seventh chord, is therefore typically avoided
in all cow musical compositions.

Farmer John, not knowing the finer points of cow musical history, decides
to play his favorite song over the loudspeakers in the barn.  Your task is
to identify all the ruminant seventh chords in this song, to estimate how
sick it will make the cows.

The song played by FJ is a series of N (1 <= N <= 20,000) notes, each an
integer in the range 1..88.  A ruminant seventh chord is specified by a
sequence of C (1 <= C <= 10) distinct notes, also integers in the range
1..88.  However, even if these notes are transposed (increased or decreased
by a common amount), or re-ordered, the chord remains a ruminant seventh
chord!  For example, if "4 6 7" is a ruminant seventh chord, then "3 5 6"
(transposed by -1), "6 8 9" (transposed by +2), "6 4 7" (re-ordered), and
"5 3 6" (transposed and re-ordered) are also ruminant seventh chords.

A ruminant seventh chord is a sequence of C consecutive notes satisfying
the above criteria. It is therefore uniquely determined by its starting
location in the song. Please determine the indices of the starting
locations of all of the ruminant seventh chords.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line specifies the starting index of a ruminant
        seventh chord (index 1 is the first note in FJ's song, index N

**Analyzing song patterns**

I'm working on a problem involving a song with up to 20,000 notes and chords of up to 10 distinct notes. The goal is to find starting positions where segments of the song match a specified chord, accounting for transpositions and reorderings. I need to identify windows within the song that correspond to the chord notes after a uniform shift. I realize there may be duplicates in the song, which complicates matching. I'll need to establish if a consistent delta exists for these notes to match the chord set.
**Developing a solution approach**

I'm figuring out how to compare a song's notes against a specified chord to see if they match in a transposed and reordered fashion. My plan is to sort the notes of the chord and calculate a normalized pattern of differences. Then, for each window in the song, I’ll sort the notes, calculate differences, and compare them to the chord's pattern.

I need to ensure there are no duplicates, as that could cause misleading zeros in my differences. I'll also restate the problem, conceptualize my solution, draft pseudocode, and organize everything neatly into a Python file.

1. Restatement  
Everyone plays a song (a list of N integer notes). A “ruminant seventh chord” is any length-C segment whose notes, when sorted and shifted by a constant, match the given C-note pattern (order and absolute pitch don’t matter). Find all starting indices of such segments.

2. Concept  
• Normalize the pattern by sorting its notes and recording differences from its minimum.  
• For each consecutive window of size C in the song, sort it, compute its differences from its minimum, and compare to the pattern’s normalized differences.  
• If equal, record the 1-based start index.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read N
read song[N]
read C
read chord[C]
chord_sorted = sort(chord)
pattern_diffs = [chord_sorted[i] - chord_sorted[0] for i in 0..C-1]

results = []
for i in 0 .. N-C:
    window = song[i : i+C]
    w_sorted = sort(window)
    window_diffs = [w_sorted[i] - w_sorted[0] for i in 0..C-1]
    if window_diffs == pattern_diffs:
        results.append(i+1)

print len(results)
for pos in results: print pos
```

4. Implementation  
The solution has been saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
