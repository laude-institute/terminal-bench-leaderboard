[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Tile Exchanging [Ray Li]

Farmer John wants to remodel the floor of his barn using a collection of
square tiles he recently purchased from the local square mart store (which
of course, only sells square objects).  Unfortunately, he didn't measure
the size of the barn properly before making his purchase, so now he needs
to exchange some of his tiles for new square tiles of different sizes.

The N square tiles previously purchased by FJ have side lengths A_1...A_N.
He would like to exchange some of these with new square tiles so that the
total sum of the areas of the his tiles is exactly M.  Square mart is
currently offering a special deal: a tile of side length A_i can be
exchanged for a new tile of side length B_i for a cost of
|A_i-B_i|*|A_i-B_i| units. However, this deal only applies to
previously-purchased tiles -- FJ is not allowed to exchange a tile that he
has already obtained via exchanging some other tile (i.e., a size-3 tile
cannot be exchanged for a size-2 tile, which is then exchanged for a size-1
tile).

Please determine the minimum amount of money required to exchange tiles so
that the sum of the areas of the tiles becomes M.  Output -1 if it is
impossible to obtain an area of M.

PROBLEM NAME: tilechng

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N (1<=N<=10) and M
        (1<=M<=10,000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the integers A_1 through
        A_N, describing the side length of an input square
        (1<=A_i<=100).

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 6
3
3
1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 3 tiles.  Two are squares of side length 3, and one is a square
with side length 1.  We would like to exchange these to make a total area of 6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum cost of exchanging tiles to obtain M units of
        total area, or -1 if this is impossible.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Exchange one of the side-3 squares for a side-2 square, and another side-3
square for a side-1 square.  This gives the desired area of 4+1+1=6 and
costs 4+1=5 units.

**Understanding the problem**

The user is looking for a solution in Python 3 for the "Tile Exchanging" problem. I’ll make sure to restate the problem clearly: FJ has N tiles with initial sid
e lengths A_i, leading to initial areas that are A_i^2. The aim is to find an optimal strategy to exchange tiles where a tile with side length A_i can be swappe
d for another side length B_i at a cost of |A_i - B_i|^2, with the possibility to choose B_i as any integer. That’s quite intriguing!
**Defining the tile game plan**

For each original tile, I need to determine the final side length B_i or decide not to exchange (in which case B_i equals A_i). The goal is to minimize the cost
 while ensuring the total area, represented by the sum of B_i^2, equals M. With constraints like N being less than or equal to 10 and M capped at 10,000, the va
lues for A_i range up to 100.

It's like a knapsack problem where costs depend on the changes made. I'll use a dynamic programming approach to achieve the desired result within acceptable com
plexity limits.
**Preparing the final solution**

I need to set up sections for the final output: restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, providing pseudocode, and noting that the solution has been
 saved to solution.py.

Next, I’ll create the code that implements this solution. The code reads input, initializes the dynamic programming array, computes the minimal costs for tile e
xchanges, and handles output appropriately. I’ll confirm that the maximum value for b is calculated efficiently, which ensures optimization.

Finally, I'll save this code into solution.py. Let's move on!

1. Restatement
FJ has N square tiles with side lengths A₁…Aₙ (areas Aᵢ²). He may exchange each original tile once to any other integer side length B (cost = (Aᵢ–B)²) to reach
a total area exactly M. Find the minimum total exchange cost, or –1 if impossible.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Use dynamic programming over tiles and achievable area sums.
- dp[s] = min cost to reach area s after processing some tiles.
- Initialize dp[0]=0, others ∞.
- For each tile of side a, build a new dp′: for every reachable sum s and every possible new side b (1…√M), update dp′[s+b²] = min(dp′[...], dp[s]+(a–b)²).
- After all tiles, dp[M] is the answer if finite.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, M
read list A of length N
INF = large number
dp = array[0..M] of INF; dp[0] = 0
max_b = floor(sqrt(M))
for each a in A:
    new_dp = array[0..M] of INF
    for s from 0 to M:
        if dp[s] is INF: continue
        for b from 1 to max_b:
            area = b*b
            if s+area > M: break
            cost = dp[s] + (a - b)^2
            new_dp[s+area] = min(new_dp[s+area], cost)
    dp = new_dp
if dp[M] < INF:
    print dp[M]
else:
    print -1
```
