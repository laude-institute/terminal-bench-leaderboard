[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The fence surrounding Farmer John's largest pasture has fallen into disrepair,
and he has finally decided to replace it with a new fence.

Unfortunately, as Farmer John is laying out the new fence, a large bee ends up
chasing him around the pasture, and as a result, the fence ends up following a
rather irregular path.  The fence can be described by a string of characters,
each either "N" (north), "E" (east), "S" (south),  or "W" (west).  Each
character describes a 1-meter run of the fence.  For example, if the string is
NESW, this means the fence starts by moving north for 1 meter, then east for 1
meter, then south for 1 meter, then west for  1 meter, returning to its starting
point.

The fence ends at the position where it started, and this is the only point
visited more than once by the path of the fence (and the starting point is only
re-visited once, at the end).  As a result, the fence does indeed enclose a
single connected region of the grassy pasture, even though this region could
have a rather strange shape.

Farmer John is curious if the path in which he laid the fence traveled clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the right side of the fence as one walks along the
path of the fence in the order specified by the string) or counter-clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the left side of the fence).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 20$).  Each  of
the next $N$ lines contains a string of length at least 4 and at most 100,
describing a single fence path.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $N$ fence paths described in the input, output a line containing
either "CW" (clockwise) or "CCW" (counterclockwise).

**Organizing output messages**

I’m figuring out the appropriate message flow for the user. They’ll get two messages: one for the commentary and another for the created file, which is okay, bu
t they initially requested a single output.

To clarify things, I'll use a final message that informs them the “solution.py” has been created, while the patch itself will be mentioned in the commentary. So
, I’ll proceed by first sending the commentary for the patch and then the final part with the four components. That sounds good!

**Problem Restatement**
- Determine if a closed fence path (given as a sequence of “N”, “E”, “S”, “W” moves) is traversed clockwise (enclosed region on the right) or counterclockwise (
region on the left).

**Conceptual Solution (Plain English)**
- Track the fence as a sequence of 2D points starting at (0,0).
- As we move along each segment, accumulate the signed “shoelace” area term: (xₙ · yₙ₊₁ – xₙ₊₁ · yₙ).
- If the total signed area is negative, the path is clockwise; if positive, it’s counterclockwise.

**Pseudocode**
```
read all input tokens into list
iterator = tokens iterator
read N from iterator

for each of N paths:
    read string s
    set x = 0, y = 0
    set area2 = 0   # twice the signed area
    for each character c in s:
        x0, y0 = x, y
        update (x,y) based on c:
            N -> y+1, S -> y-1, E -> x+1, W -> x-1
        area2 += x0 * y - x * y0
    if area2 < 0:
        print "CW"
    else:
        print "CCW"
```

The implementation has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and feed the input via stdin.
