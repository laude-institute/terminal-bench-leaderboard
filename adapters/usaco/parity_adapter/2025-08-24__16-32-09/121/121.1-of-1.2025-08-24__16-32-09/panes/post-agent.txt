[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Times17 [Brian Dean, 2012]

After realizing that there is much money to be made in software
development, Farmer John has launched a small side business writing short
programs for clients in the local farming industry.

Farmer John's first programming task seems quite simple to him -- almost
too simple: his client wants him to write a program that takes a number N
as input, and prints 17 times N as output.  Farmer John has just finished
writing this simple program when the client calls him up in a panic and
informs him that the input and output both must be expressed as binary
numbers, and that these might be quite large.

Please help Farmer John complete his programming task.  Given an input
number N, written in binary with at most 1000 digits, please write out the
binary representation of 17 times N.

PROBLEM NAME: times17

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N (at most 1000 digits).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10110111

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N times 17.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

110000100111

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The binary number 10110111 is equal to 183 in decimal form.
183 x 17 = 3111 is 110000100111 in binary format.

**Clarifying implementation steps**

The user is looking for clear implementation steps: first, to restate the problem, then provide a conceptual solution, followed by pseudocode, and finally, the
final implemented solution in Python. The task is to multiply a binary string by 17. I can use left-shifting for multiplication and need to consider handling la
rge binary numbers manually, but since Python can manage them, I can convert the binary string to an int, multiply it by 17, and then convert it back to a binar
y string as a straightforward solution.
**Formulating a straightforward solution**

The problem at hand is to multiply a given binary string by 17, which is manageable using Python's built-in support for large integers. First, I'll restate the
problem, then outline the plan with key steps: restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, writing pseudocode, and creating the final Python implementa
tion. The provided code reads the binary string, converts it to an integer, multiplies, and prints the result without leading zeros. Edge cases like an input of
 "0" are handled correctly, so this approach seems solid!

Here’s the full solution:

**Restatement**
Given a binary number N (up to 1000 bits), compute 17 × N and output the product in binary.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Read the input as a binary string.
- Use Python’s built-in big integers to convert the string to an integer.
- Multiply that integer by 17.
- Convert the product back to a binary string and print it, omitting the `0b` prefix.

**Pseudocode**
```
read binary_str from stdin
if binary_str is empty: exit
number = parse binary_str as base-2 integer
product = number * 17
output binary representation of product (without '0b')
```

The code is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```

Let me know if you’d like to run tests or need anything else!
