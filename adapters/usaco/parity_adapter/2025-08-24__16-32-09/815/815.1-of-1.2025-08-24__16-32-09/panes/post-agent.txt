[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But something about his log doesn't look quite
right...

Farmer John wants to find out how many breakouts have occurred since he started
his log. However, he suspects that the cows have tampered with his log, and all
he knows for sure is that he started his log on the day of a breakout. Please
help him determine, for each number of breakouts that might have occurred since
he started the log, the minimum number of log entries that must have been
tampered with.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the
counter was at $a_i$, unless the cows tampered with that day's log entry.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of $N$ integers, one per line. The $i$th
integer should be the minimum over all possible breakout sequences with $i$
breakouts, of the number of log entries that are inconsistent with that
sequence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
6
1 1 2 0 0 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
2
1
2
3
4

If there was only 1 breakout, then the correct log would look like 0 1 2 3 4 5,
which is 4 entries different from the given log.

If there were 2 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 3 0 1,
which is 2 entries different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first and fifth days.

If there were 3 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 0 0 1,
which is just 1 entry different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first, fourth, and fifth days.

And so on.

[2025-08-24T22:19:08] thinking

**Implementing step-by-step solution**

I need to approach this solution systematically. First, I'll restate the problem clearly. It involves FJ needing to compute the minimal number of inconsistencie
s in his log for every possible breakout count from 1 to N. On breakout days, the count starts at zero and increments between breakouts. The logged values may b
e tampered with, so I must identify the minimum mismatches in a valid k-breakout sequence starting on day one.

I'll draft the pseudocode next, then implement it in `solution.py`, using only built-in functionalities. Let's get to it!
**Preparing the solution**

I'm conceptualizing the solution by precomputing the mismatch costs for each segment between breakouts. I'll use dynamic programming to divide the N days into k
 segments for different values of k. Next, I'll lay out the pseudocode, then move on to the actual coding.

For the cost matrix, I’ll create a 2D array initialized to zero. I’ll calculate the costs and set up a dynamic programming table with dimensions (N+1)x(N+1), fi
lled with infinity. My first element will be `dp[0][0] = 0`. I'll implement triple loops for processing, and ultimately print `dp[N][k]` for k from 1 to N. Once
 I write everything in Python, including the file as `solution.py`, I'll apply the necessary patch. Now, let's finalize everything!

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Problem Restatement
   Given a log of daily counters (days since last breakout) with possible tampering, determine for each possible number of breakouts k (from 1 to N) the minimum
 number of entries that must be wrong, assuming the first day is always a breakout.

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Any valid k-breakout log partitions the N days into k consecutive segments, each starting with a breakout (counter=0) and incrementing by 1 each day.
   - Precompute `cost[l][r]`: mismatches if a segment starts on day l and ends on day r.
   - Use dynamic programming `dp[i][k]` = min mismatches for days 1…i with k segments. Transition by choosing the start `l` of the last segment:
     dp[i][k] = min over l∈[1..i] of dp[l−1][k−1] + cost[l][i].
   - The answer for each k is dp[N][k].

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read N, array a[1..N]
   for l in 1..N:
     cnt = 0
     for r in l..N:
       if a[r] != r - l: cnt++
       cost[l][r] = cnt

   initialize dp[0][0]=0, others=INF
   for i in 1..N:
     for k in 1..i:
       dp[i][k] = min(dp[l-1][k-1] + cost[l][i] for l in 1..i)

   output dp[N][1..N]
   ```

4. Implementation
   The solution is saved in `solution.py`. It reads from standard input and writes the N answers, one per line. Let me know if you want to run tests or need any
thing else!
