[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Landscaping [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a
large amount of dirt in the process.

The garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 <= N <= 100), where
flowerbed i initially contains A_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like
to re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B_i
units of dirt.  The A_i's and B_i's are all integers in the range 0..10.

To landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase
one unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for $X.  He can
remove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped
away for $Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to
flowerbed j at a cost of $Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total
cost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.

PROBLEM NAME: landscape

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Space-separated integers N, X, Y, and Z (0 <= X, Y, Z <=
        1000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated integers A_i and
        B_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 100 200 1
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 0

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 flowerbeds in a row, initially with 1, 2, 3, and 4 units of
dirt. Farmer John wishes to transform them so they have 4, 3, 2, and 0
units of dirt, respectively.  The costs for adding, removing, and
transporting dirt are 100, 200, and 1.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum cost for Farmer John's
        landscaping project.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

210

OUTPUT DETAILS:

One unit of dirt must be removed (from flowerbed #4), at a cost of 200.  The
remaining dirt can be moved at a cost of 10 (3 units from flowerbed #4 to
flowerbed #1, 1 unit from flowerbed #3 to flowerbed #2).

**Outlining a solution**

The user wants me to restate the problem, conceptualize it, create pseudocode, and then provide a Python solution saved as solution.py. Since the task is straig
htforward, I don't need a detailed plan. I’ll create the necessary deliverables: the problem restatement, a conceptual solution, the pseudocode, and the actual
code.

This relates to a minimum cost flow problem where we need to transform array A into array B, managing costs for adding, removing, and moving items between posit
ions.
**Analyzing the minimum cost flow**

I'm outlining the problem of managing surplus and deficit in dirt supply. I can push units from supply nodes to deficit nodes at a cost based on distance or dir
ectly to a sink at removal cost. Given the constraints, a straightforward minimum cost flow approach could work well, but since distances involved are small, th
is also resembles a transportation problem.

Simplifying further, I can utilize dynamic programming or a greedy matching approach to pair supplies and demands. This would involve matching costs strategical
ly based on minimum transport costs versus removal and addition costs, ensuring optimal efficiency in the matching process.
**Developing the greedy algorithm**

I'm outlining the adjustments to my greedy algorithm to consider the effective cost of sending units. The cost to send one unit from position i to j needs to ac
count for both distance and removal/addition costs. The cost function becomes piecewise linear convex, which ensures that the greedy approach remains optimal wi
thin these defined parameters.

I plan to implement the solution in a structured manner by reading inputs, computing net supplies and demands, and iterating through them. I'll carefully handle
 leftover supplies and demands, ensuring costs are calculated accurately along the way. My output will include the problem restatement, conceptual solution, pse
udocode, and the complete Python code saved as solution.py.

Here’s the complete solution:

**Problem Restatement**
We have N beds with initial dirt amounts A_i and target amounts B_i. We can buy dirt for cost X, remove dirt for cost Y, or move one unit from bed i to j for co
st Z·|i−j|. Find the minimum total cost to reach targets.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Compute the net surplus/deficit at each bed: diff_i = A_i − B_i.
- Build two lists: supplies (diff>0) and demands (diff<0).
- Greedily match supply to demand in increasing index order: move as much as possible between the closest supply/demand pair.
- Moving a unit from i to j costs min(Z·|i−j|, X+Y) (if moving’s pricier than remove+buy, do that).
- After matching, any leftover supply is removed (cost Y each), leftover demand is filled by buying (cost X each).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, X, Y, Z
for i in [0..N):
  read A_i, B_i
  diff = A_i - B_i
  if diff>0: supplies.append([i,diff])
  if diff<0: demands.append([i,-diff])

cost=0; s_idx=0; d_idx=0
while both lists have items:
  pos_s, amt_s = supplies[s_idx]
  pos_d, amt_d = demands[d_idx]
  t = min(amt_s, amt_d)
  dist = abs(pos_s-pos_d)
  per_unit = min(Z*dist, X+Y)
  cost += t*per_unit
  decrement supplies[s_idx].amt and demands[d_idx].amt by t
  advance s_idx or d_idx if amt hits 0

for remaining supplies: cost += amt * Y
for remaining demands: cost += amt * X

print(cost)
```
