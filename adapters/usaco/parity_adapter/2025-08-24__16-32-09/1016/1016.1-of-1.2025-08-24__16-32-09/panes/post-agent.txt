[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's new barn has a truly strange design: it consists of $N$ rooms
($2 \leq N \leq 2500$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$, and $N-1$ corridors.
Each corridor connects a pair of rooms, in such a way that it is possible to
walk from any room to any other room along a series of corridors.

Every room in the barn has a circular clock on the wall with the standard
integers $1 \ldots 12$ around its face. However, these clocks only have one
hand, which always points directly at one of the integers on the clock face (it
never points between two of these integers).

Bessie the cow wants to synchronize all the clocks in the barn so they all point
to the integer 12.  However, she is somewhat simple-minded, and as she walks
around the barn, every time she enters a room, she moves the hand on its clock
ahead by one position. For example, if the clock pointed at 5, it would now
point at 6, and if the clock pointed at 12, it would now point at 1.  If Bessie
enters the same room multiple times, she advances the clock in that room every
time she enters.

Please determine the number of rooms in which Bessie could start walking around
the barn such that she could conceivably set all the clocks to point to 12.
Note that Bessie does not initially advance the clock in her starting room, but
she would advance the clock in that room any time she re-entered it.  Clocks do
not advance on their own; a clock only advances if Bessie enters its room.
Furthermore, once Bessie enters a corridor she must exit through the other end
(it is not allowed to walk partially through the corridor and loop back around
to the same room).

SCORING:
Test cases 2-7 satisfy $N\le 100$.Test cases 8-15 satisfy no additional constraints.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next line contains $N$ integers, each
in the range $1 \ldots 12$, specifying the initial clock setting in each room.
The next $N-1$ lines each describe a corridor in terms of two integers $a$ and
$b$, each in the range $1 \ldots N$, giving the room numbers connected by the
corridor.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the number of rooms in which Bessie could start, such that it is possible
for her to set all clocks to point to 12.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
11 10 11 11
1 2
2 3
2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, Bessie can set all the clocks to point to 12 if and only if she starts
in room 2 (for example, by moving to room 1, 2, 3, 2, and finally 4).

[2025-08-24T20:47:22] thinking

**Considering clock arithmetic**

I’m exploring the relationship between two positions and color nodes. If one position is the next step of the other, I count it. Clock values are modulo 12, tre
ating 12 as 0. I’m wondering whether to map 12 to 0 or keep it as 12. Modulo 12 arithmetic seems essential since the clock indicates a reset at 12. In USACO's c
ontext, if the sums of two clock groups match or differ by one, I can determine starting positions, but I need clarity on comparisons.
**Refining clock sums logic**

I need to determine if the difference between two sums is equivalent to 0 or ±1 modulo 12. The editorial indicates using raw equality since the ai values fit be
tween 0 and 11, but sums can exceed 12. In checking a sample with four nodes, I realize that the group mapping impacts the sums: for group0, the sum equals 33,
and for group1, it’s 10.

Ultimately, by adjusting the values, I can simplify the calculation using modulo 12, and the algorithm consistency checks through the partition and summation lo
gic are crucial.
**Structuring the solution**

I’m thinking about how to approach the problem using modulo 12 for clock values. First, I'll build an adjacency list from N-1 edges and utilize BFS or DFS start
ing from node 0. I need to track visited nodes and assigned colors.

Then, I will compute sums for each color and check conditions based on their modulo values. If they match, I print N; if they're off by one, I print the corresp
onding count. Next, I’ll write out a clear restatement of the problem, conceptualize the solution, and create pseudocode, followed by implementing that in a Pyt
hon file named solution.py.

**Restatement**
- We have a tree of N rooms, each with a 1–12 clock. Bessie starts in some room (without advancing its clock), then every time she enters a room she increments
its clock by 1 mod 12. She must traverse edges end-to-end and wants all clocks to read 12 (i.e. 0 mod 12). Count how many starting rooms make this possible.

**Conceptual Solution**
- A tree is bipartite. Label rooms by parity of depth (two colors).
- Visiting along any closed walk affects clocks on each color differently.
- It can be shown that if the sum of clocks on both colors (mod 12) is equal, any start works; if one sum is exactly one more than the other (mod 12), only star
ts in the corresponding color class work; otherwise none work.
- We:
  - Map clock values 12→0, others to value%12.
  - BFS/DFS to color rooms 0/1.
  - Compute sums mod 12 and counts for each color.
  - Apply the above rules to get the count.

**Pseudocode**
```
read n
read list clocks, mapping 12→0
build adjacency list for tree
color[0]=0; DFS to color rest as color[u]^1
sum0 = sum(clocks[i] for color[i]==0) %12
sum1 = sum(clocks[i] for color[i]==1) %12
cnt0 = count of color 0; cnt1 = n-cnt0

if sum0==sum1:
    answer = n
elif sum0==(sum1+1)%12:
    answer = cnt0
elif sum1==(sum0+1)%12:
    answer = cnt1
else:
    answer = 0

print(answer)
```
