[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($N \leq 3 \times 10^5)$ have heights $1, 2, \ldots, N$.  One day, the cows are
standing in a line in some order playing frisbee; let $h_1 \ldots h_N$ denote
the heights of the cows in this order (so the $h$'s are a permutation of
$1 \ldots N$).

Two cows at positions $i$ and $j$ in the line can successfully throw the frisbee
back and forth if and only if every cow between them has height lower than
$\min(h_i, h_j)$.

Please compute the sum of distances between all pairs of locations $i<j$ at
which there resides a pair of cows that can successfully throw the frisbee  back
and forth.  The distance between locations $i$ and $j$ is $j-i+1$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$. The next line of input
contains $h_1 \ldots h_N$, separated by spaces.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the sum of distances of all pairs of locations at which there  are cows
that can throw the frisbee back and forth.  Note that the large  size of
integers involved in this problem may require the use of 64-bit integer data
types (e.g., a "long long" in C/C++).

SAMPLE INPUT:
7
4 3 1 2 5 6 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
24

The pairs of successful locations in this example are as follows:


(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)

SCORING
Test cases 1-3 satisfy $N\le 5000$.Test cases 4-11 satisfy no
additional constraints.

**Analyzing cow visibility**

I'm looking at how to count pairs of cows that can see each other when facing left and right, considering the first taller cow as the limit. For each cow, I nee
d to track how many cows to the right it sees until a taller one appears, including that taller cow. The conditions involve comparing heights and checking if th
e max height in-between pairs is less than the minimum of the two cows’ heights. It resembles the monotonic stack visibility problem too.
**Calculating visible pairs**

I'm figuring out how to sum the distances between adjacent pairs in a visibility graph. The algorithm uses a stack to maintain a decreasing sequence of heights,
 simplifying since heights are unique. For each cow, I’ll initialize the stack and check for taller neighbors. When I pop from the stack, I need to count the pa
irs formed with the current height while ensuring the criterion of visibility is met. This seems similar to the Cartesian tree concept, where adjacent cows can
see each other. Let's compute the nearest greater height for each position.
**Summarizing visible pairs**

I'm analyzing a sequence of pairs based on their heights and identifying which can see each other. Starting from each position, I check for taller neighbors to
the right and left. As I go through the heights, I keep track of these connections using a stack and count viable pairs. The adjacency rule states that every ad
jacent pair qualifies to see each other, regardless of their heights. It’s essential to combine both adjacency and nearest greater methods to get the total visi
ble pairs.
**Finalizing solution strategy**

I’m working through the stack approach for calculating visible pairs. Starting with heights, I’ll push and pop elements based on their relation to the current h
eight. For each pop, I’ll add the distances to my total. I'm analyzing how to summarize the task: counting all pairs \(j - i + 1\) where no taller cows obstruct
 the view between pairs. I’ll break down the steps into clear sections: restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, and writing pseudocode, followed by
 implementing the solution in Python.

Here’s a complete write-up and implementation:

**1. Problem restatement**
We have a line of \(N\) cows with distinct heights \(h_1,\dots,h_N\).  Two cows at positions \(i<j\) can throw a frisbee to each other exactly when every cow be
tween them is shorter than \(\min(h_i,h_j)\).  We need the sum of \((j - i + 1)\) over all such valid pairs \((i,j)\).

**2. Conceptual solution**
We scan from left to right, maintaining a stack of cows in strictly decreasing height order.  When a new cow arrives:
- We pop all shorter cows off the stack; each popped cow just “sees” the current cow (no blocker), so we add \((\text{current\_pos} - \text{popped\_pos} + 1)\)
for each pop.
- If the stack isn’t empty afterward, the cow currently on top is taller, so it also sees the current cow; add that distance.
- Push the current cow onto the stack.
This counts every valid pair exactly once in \(O(N)\) time.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array H[1..N]
initialize empty stack S  // holds (height, index)
ans = 0
for i in 1..N:
    h = H[i]
    while S not empty and S.top.height < h:
        (_, j) = S.pop()
        ans += (i - j + 1)
    if S not empty:
        (_, j) = S.top
        ans += (i - j + 1)
    push (h, i) onto S
print ans
```

**4. solution.py**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    H = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    stack = []  # will store (height, index)
    ans = 0

    for i, h in enumerate(H, start=1):
        # pop all shorter cows
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < h:
            _, j = stack.pop()
            ans += (i - j + 1)
        # if there's still someone taller on the stack, they see current
        if stack:
            _, j = stack[-1]
            ans += (i - j + 1)
        stack.append((h, i))

    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This runs in \(O(N)\) time and uses only built-in data structures. Let me know if you’d like to run any tests or add further comments!
