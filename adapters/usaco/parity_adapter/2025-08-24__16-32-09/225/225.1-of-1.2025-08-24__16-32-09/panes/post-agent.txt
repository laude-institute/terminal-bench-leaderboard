[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Liars and Truth Tellers [Brian Dean, 2013]

After spending so much time around his cows, Farmer John has started to
understand their language.  Moreover, he notices that among his N cows
(2 <= N <= 1000), some always tell the truth while others always lie.

FJ carefully listens to M statements (1 <= M <= 10,000) from his cows, each
of the form "x y T", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells the
truth" or "x y L", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells lies".
Each statement involves a pair of different cows, and the same pair of cows
may appear in multiple statements.

Unfortunately, FJ believes he might have written down some entries in his
list incorrectly, so there may not be a valid way to designate each cow as
a truth teller or a liar that is consistent with all the M statements on
FJ's list.  To help FJ salvage as much of his list as possible, please
compute the largest value of A such that there exists a valid way to
designate each cow as a truth teller or a liar in a manner that is
consistent with the first A entries in FJ's list.

PROBLEM NAME: truth

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Each line is of the form "x y L" or "x y T",
        describing a statement made by cow x about cow y.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 3
1 4 L
2 3 T
4 1 T

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 cows and 3 statements.  Cow 1 says that cow 4 lies, cow 2 says
that cow 3 tells the truth, and cow 4 says that cow 1 tells the truth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum value of A such that the first A entries in FJ's
        list can be consistent with some assignment of "truth teller"
        or "liar" to the N cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Statements 1 and 3 cannot both be satisfied at the same time, but
statements 1 and 2 can be, if we let cows 1..3 tell the truth and cow 4 be
a liar.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T22:00:15] thinking

**Analyzing logical implications**

I'm thinking about equivalences and looking at how implications can work both ways. So if x implies y, it seems to suggest that y must also imply x, which isn't
 always the case. This scenario creates some complexity regarding truth-telling; if x is consistently truthful, then y must be truthful too. But if y is truthfu
l, that doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about x. It looks like we're dealing with implications rather than straightforward equivalences, which is intriguin
g.
**Breaking down logical implications**

I'm processing a statement that generates two implications: if x is true, then y is true, and if x is false, then y is false. Similarly, I've got another layer
leading to equivalences. I need to ensure these constraints are consistent. I realize this can produce a general directed graph representing implications. To ch
eck for contradictions, I can use Tarjan’s algorithm for strongly connected components (SCC). If a variable and its negation are both reachable, it's unsatisfia
ble. I plan to implement this and write the solution in a Python file.
**Clarifying the problem**

I need to restate a problem in simple terms: there are N cows that are either truth-tellers or liars, and I have M statements that each cow makes about others.
The goal is to find the longest sequence of statements that can be consistent at the same time.

Next, I consider a conceptual solution, which involves using binary search to find the maximum prefix length and building an implication graph to check for cons
istency using strongly connected components (SCC). From there, I’ll move on to writing pseudocode and implementing it in a solution file.

further tweaks!
