[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow, always a fan of shiny objects, has taken up a hobby of mining
diamonds in her spare time!  She has collected $N$ diamonds ($N \leq 50,000$) of
varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in a pair of
display cases in the barn.

Since Bessie wants the diamonds in each of the two cases to be relatively similar in
size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the same case if their sizes
differ by more than $K$ (two diamonds can be displayed together in the same case if
their sizes differ by exactly $K$).  Given $K$, please help Bessie determine the
maximum number of diamonds she can display in both cases together.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq 1,000,000,000$).
The next $N$ lines each contain an integer giving the size of one of the
diamonds.  All sizes will be positive and will not exceed $1,000,000,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single positive integer, telling the maximum number of diamonds that
Bessie can showcase in total in both the cases.

**Analyzing diamond distribution**

I’m looking at a problem involving N diamond sizes and the need to create two disjoint subsets for display cases, where each subset's diameter range must be les
s than or equal to K. I realize that the subsets can’t overlap, which is crucial since a diamond can’t be in both cases. It feels like a version of the classic
USACO "diamond collector" problem. The solution involves a two-pointer sliding window technique to find the maximum length of windows and then calculating prefi
x and suffix maximums.
**Setting up diamond cases**

I’m diving deeper into how to split the diamonds into two cases based on their sizes. The idea is to sort the sizes and create an array that shows how many diam
onds fit within a certain range. For each split point at index \( i \), I need to check the best possible windows before and after that point, using two-pointer
 techniques to keep everything valid. I plan to define arrays for lengths and maximums to determine the best configurations for both cases, handling boundaries
carefully to consider empty windows as well.
**Structuring the solution**

I’m setting up a plan to solve a problem where I need to pick two non-overlapping subsets of diamond sizes with a maximum-minimum difference of K, while maximiz
ing the total number of diamonds. I’ll start by sorting the sizes and using a sliding window technique to define lengths for both subsets. Then, I’ll create pre
fix and suffix maximums to calculate the optimal split. I’ll write everything out in a clear structure: the problem restatement, conceptual solution steps, pseu
docode, and the implementation in Python.

**Problem Restatement**
Bessie has N diamond sizes and two display cases. In each case, the size difference between the smallest and largest diamond can be at most K. No diamond can go
 in both cases. Maximize the total number of diamonds displayed across the two cases.

**Solution Concept**
- Sort the diamond sizes.
- Use a two‐pointer (sliding‐window) scan to compute, for each ending index j, the largest window ending at j whose size range ≤ K. Call this `len_end[j]`.
- Build `max_pref[j]` = best single‐case count in indices [0..j].
- Also compute, for each starting index i`, the largest window starting at i` whose range ≤ K; call this `len_start[i]`, and build `max_suf[i]` = best in [i..N−
1].
- Finally, try every split between j and j+1, summing `max_pref[j] + max_suf[j+1]`, and take the maximum. This ensures two disjoint windows.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K
read array A of size N
sort A
// compute best window ending at j
l = 0
for j in [0..N-1]:
    while A[j] - A[l] > K:
        l += 1
    len_end[j] = j - l + 1
    max_pref[j] = max(max_pref[j-1], len_end[j])  // handle j=0

// compute best window starting at i
r = N-1
for i in [N-1..0]:
    while A[r] - A[i] > K:
        r -= 1
    len_start[i] = r - i + 1
    max_suf[i] = max(max_suf[i+1], len_start[i]) // handle i=N-1

answer = max_pref[N-1]  // case of using only one window
for j in [0..N-2]:
    answer = max(answer, max_pref[j] + max_suf[j+1])
print(answer)
```

**Implementation (solution.py)**
```python
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    N, K = map(int, data[:2])
    A = sorted(map(int, data[2:]))

    # best window ending at j
    len_end = [0] * N
    max_pref = [0] * N
    l = 0
    for j in range(N):
        while A[j] - A[l] > K:
            l += 1
        curr = j - l + 1
        len_end[j] = curr
        max_pref[j] = curr if j == 0 else max(max_pref[j-1], curr)

    # best window starting at i
    len_start = [0] * N
    max_suf = [0] * N
    r = N - 1
    for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
        while A[r] - A[i] > K:
            r -= 1
        curr = r - i + 1
        len_start[i] = curr
        max_suf[i] = curr if i == N-1 else max(max_suf[i+1], curr)

    # combine two disjoint cases
    answer = max_pref[N-1]
    for j in range(N-1):
        total = max_pref[j] + max_suf[j+1]
        if total > answer:
            answer = total

    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
