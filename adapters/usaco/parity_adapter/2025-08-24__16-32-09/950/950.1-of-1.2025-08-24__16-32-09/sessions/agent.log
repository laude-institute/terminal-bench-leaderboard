[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes sightseeing, and today she is looking for scenic valleys.

Of interest is an $N \times N$ grid of cells, where each cell has a height.
Every cell outside this square grid can be considered to have infinite height.

A valley is a region of this grid which is contiguous, has no holes, and is such
that every cell immediately surrounding it is higher than all cells in the
region.

More formally:
 A set of cells is called "edgewise-contiguous" if one can reach any cell of
the set from any other by a sequence of moves up, down, left, or right. A set of cells is called "pointwise-contiguous" if one can reach any cell
of the set from any other by a sequence of moves up, down, left, right, or
diagonally. A "region" is a non-empty edgewise-contiguous set of
cells.  A region is called "holey" if the complement of the region
(which includes the infinite cells outside the $N \times N$ grid) is not
pointwise-contiguous.  The "border" of a region is the set of cells
orthogonally adjacent (up, down,   left, or right) to some cell  in the region,
but which is not in the region itself.  A "valley" is any non-holey
region such that every cell in the region has height lower than every cell on
the region's border.
Bessie's goal is to determine the sum of the sizes of all valleys.

Examples
This is a region:

oo.
ooo
..o
This is not a region (the middle cell and the lower-right cell are not
edgewise-contiguous):

oo.
oo.
..o
This is a non-holey region:

ooo
o..
o..
This is a holey region (the single cell within the "donut" shape is not
pointwise-contiguous with the "outside" of the region):

ooo
o.o
ooo
This is another non-holey region (the single cell in the enter is
pointwise-contiguous with the cell in the lower-right corner):

ooo
o.o
oo.

INPUT FORMAT:
First line contains integer $N$, where $1 \le N \le 750$.

Next $N$ lines each contain $N$ integers, the heights of the cells of the grid.
Each height $h$ will satisfy $1 \le h \le 10^6$. Every height will be a distinct
integer.

In at least 19% of the test cases, it is further guaranteed that $N \leq 100$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer, the sum of the sizes of all valleys.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
1 10 2
20 100 30
3 11 50
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
30

In this example, there are three valleys of size 1:

o.o
...
o..
One valley of size 2:

...
...
oo.
One valley of size 3:

ooo
...
...
One valley of size 6:

ooo
o..
oo.
One valley of size 7:

ooo
o.o
oo.
And one valley of size 9:

ooo
ooo
ooo
Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30.

**Conceptualizing valley detection**

The user has presented a task focused on identifying scenic valleys through a Python 3 solution. First, I need to restate the problem clearly: we want to find and sum the sizes of valleys defined by regions with distinct heights. My approach involves creating a pseudocode solution and ultimately saving a Python file. Since the grid could be large, I’ll focus on efficient methods to identify connected components for values below given thresholds to determine if they qualify as valleys.
**Designing the valley detection algorithm**

I'm considering how to efficiently identify valleys by working with sorted heights. Initially, I’ll track active cells and use a union-find structure to manage them. As I add cells by height, I'll check if surrounding border heights exceed the heights in the region I'm forming to confirm it's a valley. Each component's minimum border height informs its valley status. Additionally, I’ll ensure that I account for all candidate regions at different thresholds, summing the sizes of these components accordingly. This means effectively processing overlapping valleys as I iterate through the unique height values.
**Exploring graph-based valley detection**

I'm considering an alternate approach where valley regions correlate with nodes in a minimum spanning tree of a graph formed by cells. Each cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, weighted by the maximum height. I'll apply Kruskal's algorithm to build the MST, processing edges by their weight. When connecting components at a specific weight, if the max height in the region is lower than that weight, it qualifies as a valley. I'll sum the sizes of regions when they connect to the outside. This involves carefully tracking component merges and heights throughout the process.
**Addressing holes in valley detection**

I’m considering the challenges of identifying holes in sublevel regions, which can be non-convex and surround inactive cells. For instance, a region formed by lower heights around a higher cell can create a "doughnut" shape that's considered holey and may be misclassified as a valley. I need an efficient way to track these holes during union-find operations. By precomputing connectivity and using complement components, I can identify when a region is non-holey and thus a valley, ensuring I exclude any regions that still have holes present.

**Problem Restatement**

We have an N×N grid of distinct heights.  Outside the grid is “infinite” height.  A **valley** is any connected (4-way) set R of cells with no “holes” such that every neighbor cell just outside R has strictly greater height than every cell in R.  We must find the sum of the sizes of *all* such valleys: one for every sublevel connected component exactly when its highest cell is added.

---

**High-Level Solution**

1.  Sort all cells by height ascending.  
2.  Maintain a Union-Find (DSU) over the cells, activating one cell at a time.  
3.  Each time we activate a cell (its height h), we:
    - Make it its own component (size 1).  
    - Union it with any already-active 4-way neighbors, merging sizes.  
    - Track for each component the number of internal edges E and vertices V.  Whenever we add an orthogonal adjacency, we increment E by 1.  
4.  At the moment the cell of height h is added, its component is exactly the sublevel set at threshold h, and its highest cell is h.  This component is a valley iff it has **no hole cycles** _or_ it spans the entire grid (full grid has no true hole).  We detect “no hole” by checking the cycle count 
   
   hole_faces = E − V + 1  
   
   which must be 0 for a simply-connected component.  
5.  If it is a valley, add its current size V to the running answer.

This runs in O(N² α(N²)), which is fine for N≤750.

**Pseudocode**

```
read N
read grid[N][N]
make list cells = [(height, r, c) for all r,c]
sort cells by height ascending

DSU parent, size[V], edges[E] arrays of length N*N
active = boolean[N*N] all False

answer = 0
for height, r, c in cells:
    idx = r*N + c
    active[idx] = True
    parent[idx] = idx
    size[idx] = 1
    edges[idx] = 0

    for each of the 4 orthogonal neighbors (nr,nc):
        if in bounds and active[nid]:
            root1 = find(idx)
            root2 = find(nid)
            if root1 != root2:
                # merging two comps plus this new adjacency edge
                newV = size[root1] + size[root2]
                newE = edges[root1] + edges[root2] + 1
                union(root1, root2)  # make root1 the parent
                set size[root1] = newV
                set edges[root1] = newE
            else:
                # internal edge within same comp
                edges[root1] += 1

    root = find(idx)
    V = size[root]
    E = edges[root]
    hole_count = E - V + 1
    if hole_count == 0 or V == N*N:
        answer += V

print(answer)

**Next Steps**

- You can run it with `python3 solution.py < input.txt`.  
- It uses only the standard library.
