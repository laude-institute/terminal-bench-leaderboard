[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Lineup [Brian Dean and Daniel Dara, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are lined up in a row.  Each cow is
identified by an integer "breed ID" in the range 0...1,000,000,000; the
breed ID of the ith cow in the lineup is B(i).  Multiple cows can share the
same breed ID.

FJ thinks that his line of cows will look much more impressive if there is
a large contiguous block of cows that all have the same breed ID.  In order
to create such a block, FJ chooses up to K breed IDs and removes from his
lineup all the cows having those IDs.  Please help FJ figure out
the length of the largest consecutive block of cows with the same breed ID
that he can create by doing this.

PROBLEM NAME: lineup

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the breed ID B(i).

SAMPLE INPUT:

9 1
2
7
3
7
7
3
7
5
7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 9 cows in the lineup, with breed IDs 2, 7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7, 5, 7.
FJ would like to remove up to 1 breed ID from this lineup.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The largest size of a contiguous block of cows with
        identical breed IDs that FJ can create.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By removing all cows with breed ID 3, the lineup reduces to 2, 7, 7, 7, 7,
5, 7.  In this new lineup, there is a contiguous block of 4 cows with the
same breed ID (7).

**Formulating Python solution**

I need to implement a solution in Python that involves several steps. First, I’ll restate the problem in simple terms: I have a lineup of cows with different br
eed IDs, and I need to remove cows of certain IDs to maximize the length of consecutive cows with the same breed ID.

I’ll conceptualize this using pseudocode, aiming for a sliding window approach to find the maximum blocks after potentially removing up to K breed IDs. I'll kee
p the constraints in mind while drafting the final solution.
**Clarifying breed removal strategy**

I’m focusing on a target breed T and analyzing the positions of cows that aren’t T. I can remove entire breed IDs, up to K, not just individual cows. When selec
ting which breed IDs to remove, I’m effectively eliminating all cows of those breeds from the lineup.

The goal is to find the longest consecutive block of identical breed IDs left—ideally, breed T. The challenge is to determine the best set of breed IDs to remov
e to maximize this block of breed T cows while ensuring any breeds removed don’t block runs of T in the original sequence.
**Optimizing breed removal strategy**

I need to establish a strategy for a target breed T by selecting up to K other breeds to maximize the length of consecutive T cows. The idea is to focus on a wi
ndow in the sequence that only includes T and at most K other distinct breed IDs.

As I examine these windows, if I remove non-T breeds in S, I can achieve a set of contiguous T cows. To do this efficiently, I consider using a sliding window w
ith two pointers to maintain breed frequencies and count distinct IDs. The goal is to find the maximum count of T across all possible windows while ensuring the
 number of distinct breeds remains ≤ K + 1.

**1. Problem Restatement**
We have a list of \(N\) cows in a row, each with a large integer breed ID. We may choose up to \(K\) entire breed IDs and remove all cows of those breeds. After
 removing them, the remaining cows compress together, and we want to know how long the longest contiguous run of identical breed IDs can be.

**2. High-Level Approach**
- View the original lineup as an array.
- Any contiguous run of breed \(T\) in the final lineup comes from some subarray in the original that contains only breed \(T\) and at most \(K\) *other* distin
ct breeds (those we remove).
- So we slide a window \([L,R]\) over the original array, maintaining at most \(K+1\) distinct breeds inside. Removing the other \(K\) breeds (if any) joins all
 the \(T\) cows in that window into one block of length equal to the count of \(T\) in the window.
- At each step we track the frequency counts of breeds in the window, keep it valid by shrinking from the left when we exceed \(K+1\) distinct breeds, and recor
d the highest frequency of any single breed in the window. The maximum of those frequencies is the answer.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N, K
read array B of length N

counts = empty map from breed→count
distinct = 0
heap = empty max-heap of pairs (-count, breed)
L = 0
answer = 0

for R in 0..N-1:
    b = B[R]
    increment counts[b]; if counts[b]==1: distinct++
    push (-counts[b], b) onto heap

    while distinct > K+1:
        b2 = B[L]
        decrement counts[b2]; push (-counts[b2], b2) onto heap
        if counts[b2]==0: distinct--
        L++

    // window [L..R] has ≤K+1 breeds
    // find current max frequency by cleaning heap top
    while True:
        freq, br = heap[0]
        if counts[br] == -freq:
            current_max = -freq
            break
        else:
            pop heap

    answer = max(answer, current_max)

print(answer)
```

**4. Implementation (`solution.py`)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import threading
def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    N, K = map(int, data[:2])
    B = list(map(int, data[2:]))

    from collections import defaultdict
    import heapq

    counts = defaultdict(int)
    distinct = 0
    heap = []  # will store (-count, breed)
    L = 0
    answer = 0

    for R in range(N):
        b = B[R]
        counts[b] += 1
        if counts[b] == 1:
            distinct += 1
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-counts[b], b))

        # Shrink window until we have at most K+1 distinct breeds
        while distinct > K + 1:
            b2 = B[L]
            counts[b2] -= 1
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-counts[b2], b2))
            if counts[b2] == 0:
                distinct -= 1
            L += 1

        # Clean heap top to find the true current max frequency
        while heap:
            neg_cnt, br = heap[0]
            if counts[br] == -neg_cnt:
                current_max = -neg_cnt
                break
            heapq.heappop(heap)

        answer = max(answer, current_max)

    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

**Usage**
Save this as `solution.py`, make it executable (`chmod +x solution.py`), and run:
```
./solution.py < input.txt
```
It reads from standard input and prints the desired maximum block length.
