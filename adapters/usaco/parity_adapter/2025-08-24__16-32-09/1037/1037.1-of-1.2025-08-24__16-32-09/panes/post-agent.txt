[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is worried for the health of his cows (conveniently numbered
$1 \ldots N$ as always) after an outbreak of the  highly contagious bovine
disease COWVID-19.

Recently, Farmer John tested all of his cows and found some of them to be
positive for the disease.  Using video footage from inside his barn, he is able
to review recent interactions between pairs of cows --- it turns out that when
cows greet each-other, they shake hooves, a gesture that can unfortunately
spread the infection from one cow to another.  Farmer John assembles a
time-stamped list of interacting pairs of cows, with entries of the form
$(t, x, y)$, meaning that at time $t$, cow $x$ shook hooves with cow $y$.
Farmer John also knows the following:

(i) Exactly one cow on his farm could have started out carrying the disease
(we'll call this cow "patient zero").

(ii) Once a cow is infected, she passes the infection along with her next $K$
hoof shakes (possibly including the same partner cow several times).  After
shaking hooves $K$ times, she no longer passes the infection along with
subsequent hoof shakes (since at this point she realizes she is spreading the
infection and washes her hooves carefully).

(iii) Once a cow is infected, she stays infected.

Unfortunately, Farmer John doesn't know which of his $N$ cows is patient zero,
nor does he know the value of $K$!  Please help him narrow down the
possibilities for these unknowns based on his data. It is guaranteed that at
least one possibility is valid.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100$) and $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 250$).  The next line contains a string of length $N$ whose
entries are 0s and 1s,  describing the current state of Farmer John's $N$ cows
--- 0 represents a healthy cow and 1 represents a cow presently with the
disease.  Each of the next $T$ lines describes a record in Farmer John's list of
interactions and consists of three integers $t$, $x$, and $y$, where $t$ is a
positive integer time of the interaction ($t \leq 250$) and $x$ and $y$ are
distinct integers in the range $1 \ldots N$, indicating which cows shook hands
at time $t$. At most one interaction happens at each point in time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single line with three integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, where $x$ is the
number of possible cows who could have been patient zero, $y$ is the smallest
possible value of $K$ consistent with the data, and $z$ is the largest possible
value of $K$ consistent with the data (if there is no upper bound on $K$ that
can be deduced from the data, print "Infinity" for $z$). Note that it might be
possible to have $K=0$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1100
7 1 2
5 2 3
6 2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 1 Infinity

The only candidate for patient zero is cow 1. For all $K>0$, cow 1 infects cow 2
at time 7, while cows 3 and 4 remain uninfected.

[2025-08-24T21:31:49] thinking

**Planning the solution**

The user is asking for a complete solution that includes restating, pseudocode, and the final implementation for a brute force approach. I’ll simulate each cow
as the initial infected one and iterate over K values from 0 up to a maximum. For each iteration, I'll simulate interactions in order while tracking infection s
tatus and transmission counts. If I find any K values that maintain matching infection statuses, I’ll record the minimum and maximum K. If K reaches T, it could
 imply unbounded options. This sounds like an engaging challenge!
**Clarifying the infection simulation**

I'm considering the impact of the maximum K value during the simulation. If we find that K equals T, that implies K could theoretically be infinite. The largest
 valid K correlates with total interactions, and since no cow exceeds T interactions, if the simulation for K=T holds, then it confirms the infinite possibility
.

I want to ensure the initial infected cow is never healthy at the end state. I'll only consider cows where the final state indicates they are infected. My simul
ation will track infection status and count transmission effectively, accounting only for valid interactions.
**Understanding handshake interactions**

I’m thinking about how handshake counts contribute to K when one partner is already infected. The problem indicates that once a cow is infected, it will attempt
 to transmit during its next K hoof shakes, regardless of whether the partner is healthy or infected—each handshake counts toward K.

I believe that while handshakes are attempts to spread infection, they shouldn't count toward K if an infection occurs during the handshake. Instead, they count
 only after infection takes place. So I’ll need to track pre-handshake infection statuses to properly update the counts. At the end, I’ll compare the infection
statuses to the final states to determine valid results for each cow.
**Outlining the implementation**

I’m looking at the logic for my solution. Given that K values are from 1 to 3 and T also equals 3, that implies K could be infinite. I’ll need to parse and stor
e interactions, sorting them by time, and simulate for each potential patient zero. For each K up to T, I should check if reaching T is valid, marking it as pos
sible for infinity.

The problem allows for a maximum of 250 interactions and 100 cows, resulting in significant computation. I plan to handle simulations efficiently, writing the f
inal solution as a direct response: restatement, outline, pseudocode, and implementation in Python. I aim to avoid external libraries, relying instead on pure P
ython. I’ll also read the final states and convert them into a Boolean list for easier handling. Everything seems clear, so I'm ready to write the code!

1. Restatement
Given N cows and T time-stamped hoof-shake events, each cow ends up either infected (1) or healthy (0). Exactly one cow started infected (“patient zero”), and t
hereafter any infected cow transmits the disease on her next K shakes (counting every shake, even if the partner is already infected), then stops transmitting.
Infected cows stay infected. We observe the final infected/healthy pattern and want to find:
- How many cows could have been patient zero?
- The minimum K consistent with the data.
- The maximum K consistent (or “Infinity” if there’s no upper bound).

2. Solution Outline
- Parse N, T, final states string, and the T interactions.
- Sort interactions by time.
- For each candidate cow i (1…N) whose final state is ‘1’:
  - For K from 0…T:
    - Simulate the epidemic:
      • Mark only i infected initially.
      • Track for each cow how many shakes they’ve done since infection.
      • For each event (x,y) in time order:
         – If x was infected before this shake and has done <K shakes, increment x’s shake count and infect y.
         – Similarly for y infecting x.
    - After all events, check if simulated infection pattern equals the observed. If so, record that K for cow i.
- Gather all valid (i,K) pairs.
- x = number of distinct valid i’s.
- y = minimum K over all pairs.
- z = if any valid K equals T, print “Infinity”; otherwise the maximum K.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, T
read final_str    # length N, '0'/'1'
read events list of (t,x,y)
sort events by t

validKs_by_cow = {}
for i in 1..N:
    if final_str[i-1]=='1':
        validKs = []
        for K in 0..T:
            infected = [False]*N
            shakes = [0]*N
            infected[i-1] = True
            for (t,x,y) in events:
                x-=1; y-=1
                x_inf = infected[x]
                y_inf = infected[y]
                # x infects y
                if x_inf and shakes[x]<K:
                    shakes[x]+=1
                    infected[y] = True
                # y infects x
                if y_inf and shakes[y]<K:
                    shakes[y]+=1
                    infected[x] = True
            if infected pattern matches final_str:
                validKs.append(K)
        if validKs:
            validKs_by_cow[i] = validKs

allKs = union of all validKs_by_cow values
x = size of validKs_by_cow
y = min(allKs)
if T in allKs: z = "Infinity" else z = max(allKs)
print x, y, z
