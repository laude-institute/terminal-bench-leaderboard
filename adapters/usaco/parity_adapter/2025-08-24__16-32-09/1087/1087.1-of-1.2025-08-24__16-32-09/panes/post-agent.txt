[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie has recently received a painting set, and she wants to paint the long
fence at one end of her pasture.  The fence consists of $N$ consecutive 1-meter
segments ($1\le N\le 10^5$).  Bessie has 26 different colors available, which
she labels with the letters 'A' through 'Z' in increasing order of darkness ('A'
is a very light color, and 'Z' is very dark).  She can therefore describe the
desired color she wants to paint each fence segment as a length-$N$ string where
each character is a letter.

Initially, all fence segments are uncolored.  Bessie can color any  contiguous
range of segments with a single color in a single brush stroke as long as she
never paints a lighter color over a darker color (she can only paint darker
colors over lighter colors).

For example, an initially uncolored segment of length four can be colored as
follows:


.... -> BBB. -> BBLL -> BQQL

Running short on time, Bessie thinks she may need to leave some consecutive
range of fence segments unpainted! Currently, she is considering $Q$  candidate
ranges ($1\le Q\le 10^5$), each described by  by two integers $(a,b)$ with
$1 \leq a \leq b \leq N$ giving the indices of  endpoints of the range
$a \ldots b$ of segments to be left unpainted.

For each candidate range, what is the minimum number of strokes needed to paint
every fence segment outside those in the range with its desired color while
leaving all fence segments inside the range uncolored?  Note that Bessie does
not actually do any painting during this process, so the answers for each
candidate range are independent.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $Q$.

The next line contains a string of length $N$ characters representing the
desired color  for each fence segment.

The next $Q$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$
representing a candidate range to possibly leave unpainted.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $Q$ candidates, output the answer on a new line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
8 2
ABBAABCB
3 6
1 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
3

In this example, excluding the sub-range corresponding to the desired pattern
$\texttt{BAAB}$ requires four strokes to paint while excluding $\texttt{ABBA}$
requires only three.


.... -> AA.. -> ABBB -> ABCB

SCORING:
Test cases 1-4 satisfy $N,Q\le 100$.Test cases 5-7 satisfy
$N,Q\le 5000$.Test cases 8-13 satisfy no additional constraints.

[2025-08-24T22:20:50] thinking

**Evaluating suffix strokes**

I see that when considering the suffix, we start from N and work downwards, which is tricky. We can use a reversed string for computing strokes independently fr
om i to N. By painting darker over lighter, it actually proves to be symmetrical due to the character relationship.

Let’s test the algorithm. For example, in the suffix “CB,” when reversing to “BC,” the strokes amount to 2 in one way but just 1 in another. Ultimately, it seem
s the suffix works as expected. So, I’ll move forward with preprocessing both prefix and suffix.
**Computing prefix and suffix**

To compute the prefix, I set up the first element as 0, then initialize an empty stack and strokes variable. I loop through each character, using the stack to m
anage comparisons. Each time I find a character that’s lower, I push it and increase the stroke count.

Next, I compute the suffix similarly, but this time I start from the end and work backward. The answers for queries will then be the sum of the appropriate pref
ix and suffix values. I’m also considering edge cases while ensuring it remains efficient without extra libraries.
**Computing the suffix**

I’m working on computing the suffix by iterating from 8 down to 1. For each character, I’m managing strokes and tracking a stack. If the current character is gr
eater than the top of the stack, I push it; otherwise, I pop from the stack.

I’ve run some tests for prefixes and suffixes, and they match expected results. Now, I’m thinking about whether I need a detailed plan or if it's straightforwar
d enough without one. I will restate, conceptualize, and create pseudocode before implementing the final solution in my script.

Here’s the breakdown and the solution:

1. Restatement
Bessie needs to paint all fence segments except a specified contiguous range. Painting darker over lighter in any interval costs 1 stroke. For each query range
\([a,b]\), find the minimum strokes to paint segments \(1\ldots a-1\) and \(b+1\ldots N\) independently.

2. Concept
- Precompute, for every prefix ending at \(i\), the min strokes to paint segments \(1\ldots i\).
- Precompute, for every suffix starting at \(i\), the min strokes to paint segments \(i\ldots N\).
- Use a monotonic stack algorithm: scan left-to-right (and right-to-left) counting a stroke each time you push a new darker color after popping any darker color
s above you.
- For each query \((a,b)\), answer = prefix\([a-1]\) + suffix\([b+1]\).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, Q
read string s of length N
// prefix strokes
prefix[0]=0; stack=[]; strokes=0
for i from 1 to N:
    c = s[i-1]
    while stack not empty and top > c: pop
    if stack empty or top < c:
        push c; strokes++
    prefix[i] = strokes

// suffix strokes
suffix[N+1]=0; stack=[]; strokes=0
for i from N down to 1:
    c = s[i-1]
    while stack not empty and top > c: pop
    if stack empty or top < c:
        push c; strokes++
    suffix[i] = strokes

for each query (a,b):
    print prefix[a-1] + suffix[b+1]
```

4. Solution file
The solution is saved as `solution.py`. It reads from stdin, computes prefix and suffix stroke counts in \(O(N)\), and answers queries in \(O(1)\) each.
