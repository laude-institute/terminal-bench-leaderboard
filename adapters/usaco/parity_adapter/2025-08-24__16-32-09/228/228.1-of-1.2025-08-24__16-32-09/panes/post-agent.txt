[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Party Invitations [Travis Hance, 2012]

Farmer John is throwing a party and wants to invite some of his cows to
show them how much he cares about his herd.  However, he also wants to
invite the smallest possible number of cows, remembering all too well the
disaster that resulted the last time he invited too many cows to a party.

Among FJ's cows, there are certain groups of friends that are hard to
separate.  For any such group (say, of size k), if FJ invites at least k-1
of the cows in the group to the party, then he must invite the final cow as
well, thereby including the entire group.  Groups can be of any size and
may even overlap with each-other, although no two groups contain exactly
the same set of members.  The sum of all group sizes is at most 250,000.

Given the groups among FJ's cows, please determine the minimum number of
cows FJ can invite to his party, if he decides that he must definitely
start by inviting cow #1 (his cows are conveniently numbered 1..N, with N
at most 1,000,000).

PROBLEM NAME: invite

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N (the number of cows), and G
        (the number of groups).

* Lines 2..1+G: Each line describes a group of cows.  It starts with
        an integer giving the size S of the group, followed by the S
        cows in the group (each an integer in the range 1..N).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 4
2 1 3
2 3 4
6 1 2 3 4 6 7
4 4 3 2 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 cows and 4 groups.  The first group contains cows 1 and 3, and
so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows FJ can invite to his party.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

In addition to cow #1, FJ must invite cow #3 (due to the first group
constraint), cow #4 (due to the second group constraint), and also cow #2
(due to the final group constraint).

**Clarifying group invitations**

I realize that for groups that don’t include cow #1, the count remains at zero, which we don’t check, so we could miss these groups. The starting point must def
initely include cow #1. If we’re inviting zero members in size-1 groups that don’t include cow #1, we have to invite them. It seems we must include all size-1 g
roups that exclude cow #1, as inviting at least k-1 means we must also invite the last cow. So, we should initiate the search with these groups too.
**Organizing member invitations**

After reviewing all groups, I see that for any size-1 group, if member x isn't invited yet, I need to invite x and add them to the queue. For k=2 groups, if I i
nvite one member, I must invite the other, starting with cow #1 to initiate the search. However, I need to also ensure that other size-1 groups get their member
s invited. Before starting the search, I should process all size-1 groups, inviting their only members to guarantee they’re included in the search.

This means I need a loop to check size-1 groups and invite any uninvited members before proceeding.
**Creating and applying a patch**

I’m writing an envelope for the patch that includes the file “solution.py.” The file imports necessary modules like `sys` and utilizes `deque` and `defaultdict`
.

The main function processes group sizes and members while tracking invited cows using a queue. It starts by inviting cow #1 and ensures that all members in size
-1 groups are invited too. Then, it performs a breadth-first search to update invitations based on group memberships. Finally, it prints the total number of inv
ited cows. Now, let’s apply this patch!

1. Problem Restatement
Farmer John has N cows numbered 1…N and G “friend” groups. In any group of size k, if he invites at least k–1 of its members, he must invite the last one too. H
e must start by inviting cow 1. What’s the minimum number of cows he ends up inviting after all these chain reactions?

2. Conceptual Solution
- Treat each cow invitation as propagating requirements through groups.
- Track for each group how many members are already invited.
- Use a queue (BFS) starting from cow 1 to increment each group’s count when a member is invited.
- Whenever a group’s invited count reaches size–1, invite all its remaining members and enqueue them.
- Also, any group of size 1 forces its single member to be invited immediately.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, G
for each group i:
    read size[i], members[i]
    for each member c: record that c is in group i

invited = array[N+1] = False
queue = empty deque

invite cow 1; queue.push(1)
for each group i with size[i] == 1:
    invite members[i][0]; queue.push(member)

group_cnt[i] = 0 for all i

while queue not empty:
    c = queue.pop()
    for each group i containing c:
        if group_cnt[i] < size[i]:
            group_cnt[i] += 1
            if group_cnt[i] == size[i] - 1:
                for each m in members[i]:
                    if not invited[m]:
                        invite m; queue.push(m)

print total invited count
```

4. Solution Code
The implementation is saved in `solution.py`. It uses only Python’s standard library and runs in O(N + total group sizes).
