[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Fair Photography [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are standing at various positions along
a long one-dimensional fence.  The ith cow is standing at position x_i (an
integer in the range 0...1,000,000,000) and has breed b_i (either 'G' for
Guernsey or 'H' for Holstein).  No two cows occupy the same position.

FJ wants to take a photo of a contiguous interval of cows for the county
fair, but we wants all of his breeds to be fairly represented in the photo.
Therefore, he wants to ensure that, for whatever breeds are present in the
photo, there is an equal number of each breed (for example, a photo with
all Holsteins is ok, a photo with 27 Holsteins and 27 Guernseys is ok, but a
photo with 10 Holsteins and 9 Guernseys is not ok).  Help FJ take his fair
photo by finding the maximum size of a photo that satisfies FJ's
constraints.  The size of a photo is the difference between the maximum and
minimum positions of the cows in the photo.  It is possible that FJ could
end up taking a photo of just a single cow, in which case this photo would
have size zero.

PROBLEM NAME: fairphoto

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains x_i and b_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
4 G
10 H
7 G
16 G
1 G
3 H

INPUT DETAILS:

There are six cows with breeds (from left to right) G, H, G, G, H, G.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum size of a fair
        photo.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The largest fair photo Farmer John can take is of the middle 4 cows,
containing 2 Holsteins and 2 Guernseys.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T21:13:05] thinking

**Analyzing contiguous cows**

I'm noticing something seems off with the logic regarding "a photo with all Holsteins." If we look at a sorted input with Gs and Hs, the G subarray should be a
contiguous interval in the sorted order. This means no skipping cows. For instance, if I want a subarray from positions 1 to 4 including only Gs, I can't includ
e an H at position 3. The only block of Gs exists at positions 4, 7, and 16, but there's an H between 7 and 16, disrupting the contiguity.
**Finding contiguous blocks of cows**

I'm analyzing the maximal contiguous block of G cows. Between positions 1 and 4, there's an H at position 3, breaking the contiguity. This gives other options:
the blocks could be between 4 and 7, or just 16, or just 1. The best choice is position 7 with 2 Gs and 2 Hs.

The approach is to sort by position, converting into an array mapping Gs to +1 and Hs to -1, and compute prefix sums to find segments with equal counts of Gs an
d Hs. I'll focus on addressing segments carefully to avoid single-breed miscounts.
**Planning the solution**

I realize that segments with only one breed, like all Gs or all Hs, need to count correctly in my algorithm. If only Hs are present, then there's no G to count,
 but it still meets criteria since counts refer to breeds present.

To solve the problem, I'll sort the input, compute prefix sums to find segments with equal counts of Gs and Hs, and also track runs of the same breed to determi
ne sizes.

The algorithm will focus on both equal segments and single-breed runs, ensuring I capture the maximum size. I'll finally restate everything clearly as statement
s, conceptualize the logic, create pseudocode, and save everything as solution.py to keep it organized. Let's get started!
**Structuring the task plan**

I see this is a multi-step user request, so I should definitely use an update plan. My plan will break it down into four steps: 1. Restate the problem, 2. Conce
ptualize the solution, 3. Write pseudocode, and 4. Implement the solution in solution.py.

I’ll create this stepwise plan, marking the first step as "in progress." After restating, I’ll update the plan again to reflect my progress and tackle the next
steps sequentially.

Now, I’ll send that update plan and get started!

I’ve added **solution.py** with a Python 3 implementation that:

- Sorts cows by position.
- Uses prefix sums to find the largest interval with equal G/H counts.
- Checks contiguous runs for single-breed intervals.
- Prints the maximum interval size.

Let me know if you’d like any tests or further adjustments!
