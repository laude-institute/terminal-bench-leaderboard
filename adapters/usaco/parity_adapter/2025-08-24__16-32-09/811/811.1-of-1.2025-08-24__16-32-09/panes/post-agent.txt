[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's winter on the farm, and that means snow! There are $N$ tiles on the path
from the farmhouse to the barn, conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, and tile $i$
is covered in $f_i$ feet of snow.

Farmer John starts off on tile $1$ and must reach tile $N$ to wake up the cows.
Tile $1$ is sheltered by the farmhouse roof, and tile $N$ is sheltered by the
barn roof, so neither of these tiles has any snow. But to step on the other
tiles, Farmer John needs to wear boots!

In his foul-weather backpack, Farmer John has $B$ pairs of boots, numbered
$1 \dots B$. Some pairs are more heavy-duty than others, and some pairs are more
agile than others. In particular, pair $i$ lets FJ step in snow at most $s_i$
feet deep, and lets FJ move at most $d_i$ forward in each step.

Unfortunately, the boots are packed in such a way that Farmer John can only
access the topmost pair at any given time. So at any time, Farmer John can
either put on the topmost pair of boots (discarding his old pair) or discard the
topmost pair of boots (making a new pair of boots accessible).

Farmer John can only change boots while standing on a tile. If that tile has $f$
feet of snow, both the boots he takes off AND the boots he puts on must be able
to withstand at least $f$ feet of snow. Intermediate pairs of boots which he
discards without wearing do not need to satisfy this restriction.

Help Farmer John minimize waste, by determining the minimum number of pairs of
boots he needs to discard in order to reach the barn.  You may assume that
Farmer John is initially not wearing any boots.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $B$
($2 \leq N,B \leq 250$).

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers.  The $i$th integer is
$f_i$, giving the depth of snow on tile $i$ ($0 \leq f_i \leq 10^9$). It's
guaranteed that $f_1 = f_N = 0$.

The next $B$ lines contain two space-separated integers each. The first integer
on line $i+2$ is $s_i$, the maximum depth of snow in which pair $i$ can step.
The second integer on line $i+2$ is $d_i$, the maximum step size for pair $i$.
It's guaranteed that $0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq d_i \leq N-1$.

The boots are described in top-to-bottom order, so pair $1$ is the topmost pair
in FJ's backpack, and so forth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of a single integer, giving the minimum number of
boots Farmer John needs to discard. It's guaranteed that it will be possible for FJ to make it to the barn.

SAMPLE INPUT:
10 4
0 2 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 0

**Exploring the Snow Boots problem**

I'm working on a solution for the USACO problem "Snow Boots." The goal is to minimize the number of discards needed to travel from tile 1 to N, with N and B bot
h being ≤ 250. I’m thinking of using dynamic programming, where the state is defined by the tile and the current boot index. I want to explore how to manage the
 boot selection and discards efficiently as I navigate tiles while keeping track of accessible boots. Let's dive into this challenge!
**Clarifying the boot transitions**

To start moving, I need boots, and the goal is to reach tile N by strategically managing my boots. I’m thinking about using a BFS or dynamic programming approac
h where the state is defined by my current tile and the boot index. I’ll track how many boots I’ve discarded and decide whether to wear the top boot or discard
it to reach the next one. Since the problem size is manageable, I’ll focus on efficiencies by only considering necessary states as I navigate through the tiles.
**Defining discards and transitions**

I realize I need to carefully track how many boots I discard as I solve this problem. The goal is to minimize the total number of discarded pairs, whether that
involves discarding unworn boots or changing boots during movement. I can set up a dynamic programming approach where I define the state based on the current ti
le and boot index. The transitions will consider both movement and boot changes, counting discards appropriately. I'll set up a 2D array to compute the minimal
costs to reach the end tile efficiently.

1. Restatement
Farmer John needs to travel from tile 1 to tile N. Each tile has some snow depth. He has B boots in a fixed stack order; each boot has a maximum snow depth it c
an handle and a maximum step length. He can either discard the top boot or put it on (discarding his current boot), but only the topmost is accessible. Changing
 or discarding boots counts toward the discard total. Find the minimum boots discarded so he can reach tile N.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Model state as (boot b, tile i) with a cost = boots discarded so far.
- From state (b, i), with boot b you can step forward up to d_b tiles onto any tile whose snow ≤ s_b at zero extra cost.
- You can switch to any future boot b'>b at tile i if that boot supports the current tile; switching from b→b' costs (b'−b) discards (or b'−1 if b=0).
- Perform a DP over boots in increasing order, propagating movements and boot-switch transitions. The answer is the minimal cost to reach any (b, N).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, B
read snow depths f[1..N]
read boots s[1..B], d[1..B]
initialize dp[b][i] = ∞ for b=0..B, i=1..N
dp[0][1] = 0
for b from 0 to B:
    let boot_s = (b>0 ? s[b] : 0)
    let boot_d = (b>0 ? d[b] : 0)
    if b>0:
        for each tile i where dp[b][i] < ∞:
            for j from i+1 to min(N, i+boot_d):
                if f[j] ≤ boot_s:
                    dp[b][j] = min(dp[b][j], dp[b][i])
    for each tile i where dp[b][i] < ∞:
        base = (b>0 ? b : 1)
        for nb from b+1 to B:
            if s[nb] ≥ f[i]:
                cost = dp[b][i] + (nb - base)
                dp[nb][i] = min(dp[nb][i], cost)
answer = min(dp[b][N] for b in 1..B)
print(answer)
```
