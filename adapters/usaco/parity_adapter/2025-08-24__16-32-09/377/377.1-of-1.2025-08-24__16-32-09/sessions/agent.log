INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2970

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds. 
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her
980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second. 
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down. 
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

**Planning the solution steps**

The user wants a clear outline for their problem, which includes restating it in plain English, conceptualizing a solution, writing pseudocode, and finally coding in Python 3 for the `solution.py` file. This task comes down to processing two types of events—time-based and distance-based—by simulating Bessie’s motion and handling deceleration events chronologically. The code will read input, process the events, and output the rounded time, while effectively dealing with various speed segments.
**Refining the event simulation approach**

I’ve thought of a more effective way to handle the events in the race. I need to sort them based on when they will occur, regardless of whether they are time or distance events, as the occurrence will depend on the distances and speeds. I'll start with the current time and distance at zero. The goal is to travel 1000 meters while keeping track of events. The algorithm will handle these events while ensuring performance is feasible for a large number of events.
**Refining the event handling implementation**

I've thought through how to effectively loop over events, processing one per iteration. After sorting the events, I'll handle them while ensuring to compute the time required to reach the next distance or time event. There’s a concern about simultaneous events, so I'll use a robust approach to handle them. This means checking for near-equality and updating the respective counts correctly. If any event occurs after reaching the 1000m mark, I’ll stop the iteration to ensure efficiency. Now it’s about putting this all together.
**Finalizing the implementation plan**

At the start of the loop, I need to compute `time_to_finish`, checking if it's less than or equal to the minimum time for distance and time events. If it is, I’ll update the total time and distance to 1000 meters and break the loop. I’ll implement this logic in the code, taking care to handle simultaneous events and maintain proper comparisons to avoid issues with floating-point precision. Finally, I’ll create the `solution.py` file with the implemented code and follow the required structure for the message.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restatement  
   - Bessie starts at 1 m/s and after each slowdown her speed becomes 1/(k+1) m/s (k slowdowns so far).  
   - You’re given events where she slows either at a specific time or upon reaching a specific distance (up to 1000 m).  
   - Compute how long it takes her to cover 1000 m, rounding to the nearest second (0.5 rounds up).

2. Concept  
   - Maintain current time, distance, slowdown count, and speed.  
   - Keep two sorted lists: time-based events and distance-based events.  
   - At each step, calculate time to the next time event, to the next distance event, and to finish.  
   - Advance to whichever comes first; apply all simultaneous slowdowns at that instant, update speed, and repeat until 1000 m.  
   - Finally, round the total time.

3. Pseudocode  
```
read N and the N events into time_events and dist_events
sort both lists
initialize t_cur=0, d_cur=0, slow_count=0, speed=1/(1+slow_count)
loop:
    compute time_to_finish = (1000 - d_cur)/speed
    get next t_event or inf, next d_event or inf
    compute time_to_time = t_event - t_cur
    compute time_to_dist = (d_event - d_cur)/speed
    if time_to_finish is smallest:
        advance to finish, break
    elif time_to_dist is smallest:
        advance t_cur by time_to_dist, set d_cur=d_event
        remove all dist_events at this d_event, increment slow_count accordingly
    elif time_to_time is smallest:
        advance d_cur by speed*time_to_time, set t_cur=t_event
        remove all time_events at this t_event, increment slow_count accordingly
    else:  # simultaneous within epsilon
        advance both by time_to_time
        remove all matching time and dist events, increment slow_count
    update speed=1/(1+slow_count)
end loop
print round(t_cur)
```
