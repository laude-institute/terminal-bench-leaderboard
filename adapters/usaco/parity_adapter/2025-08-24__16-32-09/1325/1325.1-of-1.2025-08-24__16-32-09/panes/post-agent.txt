[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, 2x the default.**
To celebrate the start of spring, Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) have invented an intriguing new dance, where they stand in a circle and
re-order themselves in a predictable way.

Specifically, there are $N$ positions around the circle, numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$, with position $0$ following position $N-1$.  A cow resides at
each position.  The cows are also numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$.  Initially, cow $i$ starts in position $i$.  You are told a set of $K$ positions $0=A
_1<A_2< \ldots< A_K<N$ that are "active", meaning the cows in these positions are the next to move ($1 \leq K \leq N$).

In each minute of the dance, two things happen.  First, the cows in the active positions rotate: the cow at position $A_1$ moves to position $A_2$, the cow at p
osition $A_2$ moves to position $A_3$, and so on, with the cow at position $A_K$ moving to position $A_1$.  All of these $K$ moves happen simultaneously, so the
 after the rotation is complete, all of the active positions still contain exactly one cow.  Next, the active positions themselves shift:
$A_1$ becomes $A_1+1$, $A_2$ becomes $A_2+1$, and so on (if $A_i = N-1$ for some active position, then $A_i$ circles back around to $0$).

Please calculate the order of the cows after $T$ minutes of the dance ($1\le T\le 10^9$).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $T$.

The second line contains $K$ integers representing the initial set of active positions
$A_1,A_2, \ldots A_K$.  Recall that $A_1 = 0$ and that these are given in increasing order.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the order of the cows after $T$ minutes, starting with the cow in position $0$, separated by
spaces.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
0 2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 2 3 4 0

For the example above, here are the cow orders and $A$ for the first four
timesteps:


Initial, T = 0: order = [0 1 2 3 4], A = [0 2 3]
T = 1: order = [3 1 0 2 4]

[2025-08-24T21:21:31] thinking

**Developing Python solution**

I'm looking at implementing a Python 3 solution for a problem involving an array that maps cows to their positions. The cows need to rotate based on a set of ac
tive positions that shift right by one each iteration. Since T is quite large, I'm considering a direct formula to compute the final order after all iterations
rather than simulating each one. First, I’ll restate the problem clearly and then draft some pseudocode before coding the final solution in a Python file.
**Exploring position mapping**

I'm examining how active positions change over time. Each minute, the current active positions are determined by a simple formula that takes into account their
shifts. When cows occupy these active positions, they rotate among them. If a cow doesn't find itself in an active position, it stays put.

I'm considering how to apply this mapping efficiently over many iterations by shifting the coordinate system rather than moving positions each time. I’ll define
 relative positions, which could simplify how I track each cow's evolution throughout the process. Shifting cows in the opposite direction seems like a useful t
rick!
**Refining cow rotation logic**

I'm considering a new approach to manage cow rotations and shifts effectively. Instead of changing the active positions, I’ll keep them fixed and rotate the arr
ay of cows to the left by one after each rotation at the active positions. This way, I'm essentially counteracting the shift of active positions while still per
forming the necessary rotations.

At each step, the cows will be rotated based on fixed positions, and as they shift left, I want to see if the results align with the original method. After mult
iple iterations, I can derive the final positions of the cows using a defined permutation. This method seems promising for efficiently calculating the desired o
utcomes!
**Implementing rotation logic**

I'm setting up to loop through each position to determine the next one based on a mapping I created. If the previous position exists in the mapping, I’ll update
 it with the new position; if not, it just goes to the previous index.

Next, I’m decomposing the cycles to track visited nodes and effectively collect them. After that, I'll build the final result by correctly applying the necessar
y modulo operations. Once everything is in place, I’ll generate a Python file with the complete solution. Let's get this implemented!

I’ve implemented a Python solution by transforming the dynamic sliding rotations into a fixed permutation in a rotating frame, decomposing it into cycles, and m
apping cows accordingly. The final code is saved in solution.py. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or add further comments!
