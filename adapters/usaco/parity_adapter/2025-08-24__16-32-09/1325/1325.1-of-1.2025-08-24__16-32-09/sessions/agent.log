To celebrate the start of spring, Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) have invented an intriguing new dance, where they stand in a circle and re-order themselves in a predictable way.

**Developing Python solution**

I'm looking at implementing a Python 3 solution for a problem involving an array that maps cows to their positions. The cows need to rotate based on a set of active positions that shift right by one each iteration. Since T is quite large, I'm considering a direct formula to compute the final order after all iterations rather than simulating each one. First, I’ll restate the problem clearly and then draft some pseudocode before coding the final solution in a Python file.
**Exploring position mapping**

I'm examining how active positions change over time. Each minute, the current active positions are determined by a simple formula that takes into account their shifts. When cows occupy these active positions, they rotate among them. If a cow doesn't find itself in an active position, it stays put.

I'm considering how to apply this mapping efficiently over many iterations by shifting the coordinate system rather than moving positions each time. I’ll define relative positions, which could simplify how I track each cow's evolution throughout the process. Shifting cows in the opposite direction seems like a useful trick!
**Refining cow rotation logic**

I'm considering a new approach to manage cow rotations and shifts effectively. Instead of changing the active positions, I’ll keep them fixed and rotate the array of cows to the left by one after each rotation at the active positions. This way, I'm essentially counteracting the shift of active positions while still performing the necessary rotations.

At each step, the cows will be rotated based on fixed positions, and as they shift left, I want to see if the results align with the original method. After multiple iterations, I can derive the final positions of the cows using a defined permutation. This method seems promising for efficiently calculating the desired outcomes!
**Implementing rotation logic**

I'm setting up to loop through each position to determine the next one based on a mapping I created. If the previous position exists in the mapping, I’ll update it with the new position; if not, it just goes to the previous index.

Next, I’m decomposing the cycles to track visited nodes and effectively collect them. After that, I'll build the final result by correctly applying the necessary modulo operations. Once everything is in place, I’ll generate a Python file with the complete solution. Let's get this implemented!

I’ve implemented a Python solution by transforming the dynamic sliding rotations into a fixed permutation in a rotating frame, decomposing it into cycles, and mapping cows accordingly. The final code is saved in solution.py. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or add further comments!
