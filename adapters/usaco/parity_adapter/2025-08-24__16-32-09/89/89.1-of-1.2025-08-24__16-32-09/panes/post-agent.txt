[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Cow Lineup [Brian Dean]

Farmer John has hired a professional photographer to take a picture of some
of his cows.  Since FJ's cows represent a variety of different breeds, he
would like the photo to contain at least one cow from each distinct breed
present in his herd.

FJ's N cows are all standing at various positions along a line, each
described by an integer position (i.e., its x coordinate) as well as an
integer breed ID.  FJ plans to take a photograph of a contiguous range of
cows along the line.  The cost of this photograph is equal its size -- that
is, the difference between the maximum and minimum x coordinates of the
cows in the range of the photograph.

Please help FJ by computing the minimum cost of a photograph in which there
is at least one cow of each distinct breed appearing in FJ's herd.

PROBLEM NAME: lineup

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of cows, N (1 <= N <= 50,000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains two space-separated positive
        integers specifying the x coordinate and breed ID of a single
        cow.  Both numbers are at most 1 billion.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
25 7
26 1
15 1
22 3
20 1
30 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 cows, at positions 25,26,15,22,20,30, with respective breed IDs
7,1,1,3,1,1.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The smallest cost of a photograph containing each distinct
        breed ID.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The range from x=22 up through x=26 (of total size 4) contains each of the
distinct breed IDs 1, 3, and 7 represented in FJ's herd.

1. Restated the problem:
   Find the smallest distance between the furthest and nearest cows in any contiguous lineup that includes every breed at least once.

2. Conceptual solution:
   - Sort cows by position.
   - Use a sliding window with two pointers to maintain a range containing all distinct breeds.
   - Expand the right pointer until all breeds are included, then shrink the left to minimize range, tracking the minimum width.

3. Pseudocode:
   ```
   read N and list of (x, breed)
   sort list by x
   total_distinct = count of unique breeds
   initialize counts map, unique_count=0, best=inf, left=0
   for right in 0..N-1:
       add breed at right; increment unique_count if first
       while unique_count == total_distinct:
           update best with x[right]-x[left]
           remove breed at left; decrement unique_count if zero
           left += 1
   print best
   ```

Created solution.py with the implementation above.
