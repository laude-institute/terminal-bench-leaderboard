[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Mooo Moo [silver] [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has completely forgotten how many cows he owns!  He is too
embarrassed to go to his fields to count the cows, since he doesn't want
the cows to realize his mental lapse.  Instead, he decides to count his
cows secretly by planting microphones in the fields in which his cows tend
to gather, figuring that he can determine the number of cows from the total
volume of all the mooing he hears.

FJ's N fields (1 <= N <= 100) are all arranged in a line along a long
straight road.  Each field might contain several types of cows; FJ
owns cows that come from B different breeds (1 <= B <= 20), and a cow
of breed i moos at a volume of V(i) (1 <= V(i) <= 100).  Moreover,
there is a strong wind blowing down the road, which carries the sound
of mooing in one direction from left to right: if the volume of mooing
in some field is X, then in the next field this will contribute X-1 to
the total mooing volume (and X-2 in the field after that, etc.).
Otherwise stated, the mooing volume in a field is the sum of the
contribution due to cows in that field, plus X-1, where X is the total
mooing volume in the preceding field.

Given the volume of mooing that FJ records in each field, please compute
the minimum possible number of cows FJ might own.

The volume FJ records in any field is at most 100,000.

PROBLEM NAME: mooomoo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integers N and B.

* Lines 2..1+B: Line i+1 contains the integer V(i).

* Lines 2+B..1+B+N: Line 1+B+i contains the total volume of all mooing
        in field i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 2
5
7
0
17
16
20
19

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ owns 5 fields, with mooing volumes 0,17,16,20,19.  There are two breeds
of cows; the first moos at a volume of 5, and the other at a volume of 7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows owned by FJ, or -1 if there is no
        configuration of cows consistent with the input.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 2 cows of breed #1 and 1 cow of breed #2 in field 2, and there is
another cow of breed #1 in field 4.

**Clarifying algorithm problem**

The user has asked for a solution to an algorithmic problem in Python without any external libraries. First, I need to restate the problem in simple language an
d then conceptualize how to solve it. After that, I'll create pseudocode to outline the solution. Finally, I’ll save everything in a standalone script named sol
ution.py.

The main constraints are that there may be up to 100 fields and 20 breeds, with specific rules for calculating contributions from both cows and wind effects. I’
ll carefully work through how each field's values interact to define the recorded volumes.
**Refining volume contribution logic**

I’m pondering over the volume contributions from the previous fields. If X-1 is negative, it doesn’t make sense to reduce total volumes; rather, it should contr
ibute zero instead. The problem states that if the volume is X, the next field contributes X-1, suggesting it could lower the total. I realize that if we treat
the carry as the maximum of (M[i-1] - 1) or 0, it aligns better with the example given.

I think this is shaping up to be a classic dynamic programming or greedy approach to calculate the minimum counts needed across fields while maintaining non-neg
ative integers. If it’s impossible to meet the target for any field, we have to account for that too.
**Composing solution.py**

I'm putting together the solution in Python now. First, I’m defining the main function and setting up to read input data properly. I'll create lists for the rec
orded volumes and the contributions.

I think using integers for the infinite values is best, so I'll set INF to 10**9. This helps avoid issues when checking conditions in the dynamic programming lo
op, ensuring everything stays integer-based.

I'll finalize the code and make sure to account for cases where prior volumes might be negative. All systems appear operational, so let’s proceed with the patch
!

1. Problem restatement
Farmer John has N fields in a line and B cow breeds, each breed i gives moo volume V[i]. Wind carries each field’s total moo volume X into the next field as max
(X−1,0). Given the recorded volumes M[1..N], find the minimum total number of cows (across all fields) that could produce these readings, or −1 if none.

2. Solution concept
- For each field i, compute the “carry” from the previous field: carry[i] = max(M[i−1]−1,0).
- The remaining volume t[i] = M[i] − carry[i] must come exactly from cows in field i.
- This is an unbounded coin-change: cow breeds are “coins” of value V[j], and we need to make sum t[i] with the fewest coins.
- Precompute a DP array up to max(t) to get min coins for every sum, then sum dp[t[i]] over all fields. If any t[i]<0 or dp[t[i]] is infinite, answer −1.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, B
read array V of length B
read array M of length N
t = empty list
for i in 0..N−1:
    carry = max(M[i−1]−1, 0) if i>0 else 0
    needed = M[i] − carry
    if needed < 0: print(-1); exit
    t.append(needed)
max_t = max(t)
dp = array[0..max_t] filled with INF; dp[0]=0
for s in 1..max_t:
    for each coin in V:
        if s>=coin:
            dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s-coin]+1)
total = 0
for needed in t:
    if dp[needed] >= INF: print(-1); exit
    total += dp[needed]
print(total)
```
