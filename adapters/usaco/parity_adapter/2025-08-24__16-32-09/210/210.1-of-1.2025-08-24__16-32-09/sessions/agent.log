[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Milk Routing [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's farm has an outdated network of M pipes (1 <= M <= 500) for
pumping milk from the barn to his milk storage tank.  He wants to remove
and update most of these over the next year, but he wants to leave exactly
one path worth of pipes intact, so that he can still pump milk from the
barn to the storage tank.

The pipe network is described by N junction points (1 <= N <= 500), each of
which can serve as the endpoint of a set of pipes.  Junction point 1 is the
barn, and junction point N is the storage tank.  Each of the M
bi-directional pipes runs between a pair of junction points, and has an
associated latency (the amount of time it takes milk to reach one end of
the pipe from the other) and capacity (the amount of milk per unit time
that can be pumped through the pipe in steady state).  Multiple pipes
can connect between the same pair of junction points.

For a path of pipes connecting from the barn to the tank, the latency
of the path is the sum of the latencies of the pipes along the path,
and the capacity of the path is the minimum of the capacities of the
pipes along the path (since this is the "bottleneck" constraining the
overall rate at which milk can be pumped through the path).  If FJ
wants to send a total of X units of milk through a path of pipes with
latency L and capacity C, the time this takes is therefore L + X/C.

Given the structure of FJ's pipe network, please help him select a single
path from the barn to the storage tank that will allow him to pump X units
of milk in a minimum amount of total time.

**Understanding the task**

The user wants to tackle a problem that involves finding an optimal path from node 1 to node N while minimizing a specific time function. The function includes latencies and capacities, specifically calculating time based on a given formula. 

To solve this, I’ll restate the problem clearly, outline the conceptual approach, draft pseudocode, and then implement it in a single Python script without using any external libraries. The strategy involves examining possible capacities to derive the shortest paths and their respective times — ultimately seeking the minimal time.
**Refining the approach**

With a maximum of 500 unique capacities, I’m sorting these in descending order. For each capacity, I'll run Dijkstra's algorithm, estimating the time complexity as manageable at around 4.5 million operations.

I can also run Dijkstra on a thresholded graph by filtering edges that meet the required capacity. As I calculate the minimal latency and compute the time using X divided by capacity, I'll need to ensure precision. Adding a small epsilon will help me avoid floating-point inaccuracies when computing the final result. This way ensures a reliable output while keeping it simple.
**Planning the implementation**

I’ll start by parsing the input and building an adjacency list to store neighbors, latencies, and capacities. For each unique capacity, I'll filter the edges to only include those meeting the threshold. Even though that will require quite a few operations, it should be manageable.

Next, I’ll apply Dijkstra's algorithm, keeping track of the shortest distance. After calculating the minimum time, I need to ensure I handle scenarios where there might be no path, even though the problem states that the network should be connected. I’ll use the pseudocode framework as a guide and format everything into the solution.py file. Then, I’ll include a brief preamble about creating the Python file before the final implementation.

I’ve added `solution.py`, which iterates over each unique capacity threshold, runs Dijkstra to find the shortest latency path using edges of at least that capacity, computes total time (`latency + X/capacity`), and tracks the minimum. Let me know if you’d like to test it or need any tweaks!
