Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nProblem 1: Milk Scheduling [Traditional, 2011]\n\nFarmer John has N cows that need to be milked (1 <= N <= 10,000), each of\nwhich takes only one unit of time to milk.\n\nBeing impatient animals, some cows will refuse to be milked if Farmer\nJohn waits too long to milk them.  More specifically, cow i produces g_i\ngallons of milk (1 <= g_i <= 1000), but only if she is milked before a\ndeadline at time d_i (1 <= d_i <= 10,000).  Time starts at t=0, so at most\nx total cows can be milked prior to a deadline at time t=x.\n\nPlease help Farmer John determine the maximum amount of milk that he can\nobtain if he milks the cows optimally.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: msched\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The value of N.\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integers g_i and d_i.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n4\n10 3\n7 5\n8 1\n2 1\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 4 cows.  The first produces 10 gallons of milk if milked by time\n3, and so on.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The maximum number of gallons of milk Farmer John can\n        obtain.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n25\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nFarmer John milks cow 3 first, giving up on cow 4 since she cannot be\nmilked by her deadline due to the conflict with cow 3.  Farmer John then\nmilks cows 1 and 2.\n\n[END PROBLEM]'", 'Enter']
