[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has lost his prize cow Bessie, and he needs to find her!

Fortunately, there is only one long path running across the farm, and Farmer
John knows that Bessie has to be at some location on this path.  If we think of
the path as a number line, then Farmer John is currently at position $x$ and
Bessie is currently at position $y$ (unknown to Farmer John).  If Farmer John
only knew where Bessie was located, he could walk directly to her, traveling a
distance of $|x - y|$.  Unfortunately, it is dark outside and Farmer John can't
see anything.  The only way he can find Bessie is to walk back and forth until
he eventually reaches her position.

Trying to figure out the best strategy for walking back and forth in his search,
Farmer John consults the computer science research literature and is
somewhat amused to find that this exact problem has not only been studied by
computer scientists in the past, but that it is actually called the "Lost Cow
Problem" (this is actually true!).

The recommended solution for Farmer John to find Bessie is to move to position
$x+1$, then reverse direction and move to position $x-2$, then to position
$x+4$, and so on, in a  "zig zag" pattern, each step moving twice as far from
his initial starting position as before.  As he has read during his study of algorithms
for solving the lost cow problem, this approach guarantees that he will at worst
travel 9 times the direct distance $|x-y|$ between himself and Bessie before he
finds her (this is also true, and the factor of 9 is actually the smallest such
worst case guarantee any strategy can achieve).

Farmer John is curious to verify this result.  Given $x$ and $y$, please compute
the  total distance he will travel according to the zig-zag search strategy above
until he finds Bessie.

INPUT FORMAT:
The single line of input contains two distinct space-separated integers $x$ and
$y$.  Both are in the range $0 \ldots 1,000$.

Print one line of output, containing the distance Farmer John will travel to
reach Bessie.

**Understanding the Lost Cow Problem**

The user wants to solve the USACO "Lost Cow" problem step by step. First, I'll restate the problem in simple terms: it involves a cow moving between points with specific offsets. Then, I’ll outline a conceptual solution: calculating distances based on the cow's movements. 

Next, I’ll write pseudocode for this logic. Finally, I'll save the complete Python code in a file called `solution.py`. It's a straightforward exercise, so I don't need additional planning tools.

**Restatement**
- Farmer John starts at position `x` on a number line and must find his cow at unknown position `y`.
- He searches by walking in a zig-zag: first to `x+1`, then to `x-2`, then to `x+4`, doubling the distance each time and alternating direction.
- We need to compute how many total steps he takes until he reaches `y`.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Track FJ’s current position and total distance traveled.
- For each search leg (with distance magnitudes 1,2,4,8,…), compute the next target.
- If `y` lies between the current position and this target, add just the distance up to `y` and stop.
- Otherwise, add the full leg’s distance, move to the target, and double the leg length for the next iteration.

**Pseudocode**
```
read x, y
total = 0
current = x
step = 1
loop:
    if iteration is even:
        offset = -step
    else:
        offset = +step
    target = x + offset

    if y is between current and target:
        total += abs(current - y)
        break
    else:
        total += abs(current - target)
        current = target
        step *= 2

print total
```
