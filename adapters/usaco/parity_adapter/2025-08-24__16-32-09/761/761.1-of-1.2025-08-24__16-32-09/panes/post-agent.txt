Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John purchases three cows: Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, each of whom
initially produces 7 gallons of milk per day.  Since the milk output of a cow is
known to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements
over the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book.  Entries in his
log look like this:


35 Bessie -2
14 Mildred +3

The first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons
lower than it was when last measured.  The next entry indicates that on day 14,
Mildred's  milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured.
Farmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given
day.  Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write
down his measurements in chronological order.

To keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn
the picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several
cows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures).
Please determine the number of days on which Farmer John would have needed to
change this display.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, the number of measurements Farmer John
makes. Each of the next $N$ lines contains one measurement, in the format above,
specifying  a day (an integer in the range 1..100), the name of a cow, and the
change in her  milk output since it was last measured (a nonzero integer).  Each
cow's milk output will always be in the  range 0..1000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of days (an integer in the range 0..100) on which
Farmer John needs to adjust his motivational display.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
7 Mildred +3
4 Elsie -1
9 Mildred -1
1 Bessie +2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

Initially, all cows have milk output 7.  On day 1, Bessie's milk output
increases to 9, making her the unique cow with highest milk output and causing
Farmer John to change his display.  On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to
6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead.
On day 7, Mildred jumps into the  lead, changing the display, and on day 9,
Mildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display.

[2025-08-24T22:23:29] codex

Here’s the full breakdown and the solution file:

**Problem Restatement**
Three cows start with 7 gallons/day each. Over *N* days, you log changes (±) to a cow’s output on certain days (1–100). You display the highest-producing cow(s)
 each day; ties show all top cows. Count how many days the display changes.

**Solution Concept**
- Parse all measurements into a list.
- Sort by day.
- Track each cow’s milk output (start at 7) and the current display set (initially all three).
- For each event, update that cow’s output, recompute the top output and the set of cows tied at that level.
- If this set differs from the previous display, increment a counter and update the display.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
for each measurement:
    parse day, cow_name, change
    add to events list
sort events by day
initialize milk outputs to 7 for each cow
set display = {all cows}
changes = 0
for each event in order:
    update cow’s milk by change
    find max_output = max(milk values)
    new_display = {cows with milk == max_output}
    if new_display != display:
        changes += 1
        display = new_display
print changes
```

The file `solution.py` has been created with this logic. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
