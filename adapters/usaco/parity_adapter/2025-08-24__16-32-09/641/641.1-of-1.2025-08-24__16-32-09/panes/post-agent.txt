[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($3 \leq N \leq 50,000$) are all located at distinct
positions in his two-dimensional field.  FJ wants to enclose all of the cows
with a rectangular fence whose sides are parallel to the x and y axes, and he
wants this fence to be as small as possible so that it contains every cow (cows
on the boundary are allowed).

FJ is unfortunately on a tight budget due to low milk production last quarter.
He would therefore like to build an even smaller fenced enclosure if possible,
and he is willing to sell one cow from his herd to make this possible.

Please help FJ compute the smallest possible area he can enclose with his fence
after removing one cow from his herd (and thereafter building the tightest
enclosing fence for the remaining $N-1$ cows).

For this problem, please treat cows as points and the fence as a collection of
four line segments (i.e., don't think of the cows as "unit squares").  Note that
the answer can be zero, for example if all remaining cows end up standing  in a
common vertical or horizontal line.  Finally, note that since $N$ can be quite
large, you may need to be careful in how you solve this problem to make sure
your program runs quickly enough!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines each contain two
integers specifying the location of a cow.  Cow locations are positive integers
in the range $1 \ldots 40,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write a single integer specifying the minimum area FJ can enclose with his fence
after removing one carefully-chosen cow from his herd.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
2 4
1 1
5 2
17 25
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

**Evaluating strategy for bounding box**

I’m thinking about how to find cows affecting the bounding box area. The plan is to identify the top two minimum and maximum values for x and y coordinates. Fro
m that, I’ll calculate the area by removing each candidate cow, yielding: area = (max_x' - min_x') * (max_y' - min_y'). I’ll need to handle the edge case of int
eger coordinates, and my implementation in Python will involve reading coordinates and computing sorted values for efficient access.
**Developing candidate area calculation**

I need to compute values for the bounding box area based on candidate cows. For each candidate, I'll check if it's on an extreme position. If it is, I'll use th
e next extreme for calculations. This requires ensuring that I have unique extreme points in my candidate set. Distinct coordinates will help me sort points int
o x and y categories.

I’ll compute the area based on those points after the candidates are chosen. Overall, the goal is to find the minimum area among all candidates.
**Restating the Problem**

We have N points and need to remove exactly one point to minimize the area of the axis-aligned bounding rectangle enclosing the remaining points. The goal is to
 compute the minimal area after this removal.

**Solution Concept**

The bounding box is determined by the extreme points, and removing a point only affects the area if it is one of those extremes. Thus, we only need to consider
removing the smallest or largest two x or y coordinates.

**Pseudocode**

```
Read points list.
sorted_x = sorted(points by x)
sorted_y = sorted(points by y)
candidates = set of first two and last two elements of sorted_x + sorted_y.
min_area = inf
for c in candidates:
    if len(points) -1 < 1: area = 0
    else:
        determine minx: if c == sorted_x[0] then sorted_x[1].x else sorted_x[0].x;
        similar maxx, miny, maxy
        area = (maxx - minx) * (maxy - miny)
    if area < min_area: min_area = area
print(min_area)
```

**Implementation in solution.py**

```python
def main():
    import sys
    points = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in sys.stdin]
    sorted_x = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[0])
    sorted_y = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[1])

    candidates = set(sorted_x[:2] + sorted_x[-2:] + sorted_y[:2] + sorted_y[-2:])
    min_area = float('inf')

    for c in candidates:
        if len(points) - 1 < 1:
            area = 0
        else:
            minx = sorted_x[1][0] if c == sorted_x[0] else sorted_x[0][0]
            maxx = sorted_x[-2][0] if c == sorted_x[-1] else sorted_x[-1][0]
            miny = sorted_y[1][1] if c == sorted_y[0] else sorted_y[0][1]
            maxy = sorted_y[-2][1] if c == sorted_y[-1] else sorted_y[-1][1]
            area = (maxx - minx) * (maxy - miny)

**Problem Restatement**
We have N distinct points on a plane. We want to remove exactly one point so that the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle enclosing the remaining N–1 po
ints is as small as possible. Output that minimum possible area.

**Solution Concept**
- The bounding rectangle of a point set is determined by its min and max x-coordinates and min and max y-coordinates.
- Removing a point only affects the rectangle if that point is currently at one of those four extremes.
- Therefore, we only need to consider removing cows that are among the two smallest or two largest x-coordinates or y-coordinates (at most 8 candidates total).

- For each candidate removal, compute the new min/max x and y (using the 1st or 2nd extreme depending on whether the removed cow was the 1st), then compute area
 = (max_x–min_x)*(max_y–min_y).
- Take the minimum over these candidates.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read list of points P as (x,y)
sort P by x → Px
sort P by y → Py

candidates ← unique set of Px[0], Px[1], Px[-2], Px[-1], Py[0], Py[1], Py[-2], Py[-1]

best_area ← ∞

for cow in candidates:
    if cow == Px[0]:   min_x ← Px[1].x
    else:              min_x ← Px[0].x

    if cow == Px[-1]:  max_x ← Px[-2].x
    else:              max_x ← Px[-1].x

    if cow == Py[0]:   min_y ← Py[1].y
    else:              min_y ← Py[0].y

    if cow == Py[-1]:  max_y ← Py[-2].y
    else:              max_y ← Py[-1].y

    area ← (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)
    best_area ← min(best_area, area)
