[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Combination Lock [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's cows keep escaping from his farm and causing mischief. To try
and prevent them from leaving, he purchases a fancy combination lock to
keep his cows from opening the pasture gate.

Knowing that his cows are quite clever, Farmer John wants to make sure they
cannot easily open the lock by simply trying many different combinations.
The lock has three dials, each numbered 1..N (1 <= N <= 100), where 1 and N
are adjacent since the dials are circular.  There are two combinations that
open the lock, one set by Farmer John, and also a "master" combination set
by the lock maker.  The lock has a small tolerance for error, however, so
it will open even if the numbers on the dials are each within at most 2
positions of a valid combination.  For example, if Farmer John's
combination is (1,2,3) and the master combination is (4,5,6), the lock will
open if its dials are set to (1,N,5) (since this is close enough to Farmer
John's combination) or to (2,4,8) (since this is close enough to the master
combination).  Note that (1,5,6) would not open the lock, since it is not
close enough to any one single combination.

Given Farmer John's combination and the master combination, please
determine the number of distinct settings for the dials that will open the
lock.  Order matters, so the setting (1,2,3) is distinct from (3,2,1).

PROBLEM NAME: combo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Line 2: Three space-separated integers, specifying Farmer John's
        combination.

* Line 3: Three space-separated integers, specifying the master
        combination (possibly the same as Farmer John's combination).

SAMPLE INPUT:

50
1 2 3
5 6 7

INPUT DETAILS:

Each dial is numbered 1..50.  Farmer John's combination is (1,2,3), and the
master combination is (5,6,7).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of distinct dial settings that will open the
        lock.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

249

**Planning implementation steps**

I’m thinking it's best to enumerate all triples within a tolerance of FJ and master by using a set to count unique combinations. For N up to 100, that brings ab
out 125k possible combos, with k being 5 — meaning 250 combinations. I’ll iterate through these efficiently. Essentially, I need to read N and two tuples, gener
ate a set, and then compute the tuples with offsets for all dials.

I’ll summarize my plan into four clear steps: restate the problem, conceptualize it, create pseudocode, and then produce the final file. Let’s get started!
**Drafting final implementation steps**

I’m planning to organize my apply_patch calls in the final channel, while shell commands will appear in the commentary. I realize I need to frame my final messa
ge clearly with a proper structure. So, I’ll present my restatement, conceptualization, and pseudocode before introducing the apply_patch.

I'll combine all this into a single message format stating the steps followed by the preamble and the patch. This will ensure clarity and adherence to guideline
s. Let’s draft it effectively.

1. Restated Problem
- Count how many 3-dial lock settings (1..N, wrap-around) lie within 2 steps on each dial of either Farmer John’s or the master combination.

2. Conceptual Solution
- For each of the two given combos, enumerate all triples where each dial is offset by –2…+2 (with wrap-around).
- Take the union of these two sets to avoid duplicates.
- The answer is the size of that union.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read combo1[3]
read combo2[3]

function neighbors(combo, N):
  set S
  for dx in -2..2:
    for dy in -2..2:
      for dz in -2..2:
        a = wrap(combo[0] + dx, N)
        b = wrap(combo[1] + dy, N)
        c = wrap(combo[2] + dz, N)
        add (a,b,c) to S
  return S

valid = neighbors(combo1, N) ∪ neighbors(combo2, N)
print size of valid
```
