[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his archnemesis Farmer Nhoj are playing a game in a circular
barn. There are $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) rooms in the barn, and the $i$th room
initially contains  $a_i$ cows ($1 \leq a_i \leq 5\cdot 10^6$). The game is
played as follows:

Both farmers will always be in the same room. After entering a room, each
farmer takes exactly one turn, with Farmer John going first. Both farmers
initially enter room $1$.If there are zero cows in the current room, then the farmer to go loses.
Otherwise, the farmer to go chooses an integer $P$, where $P$ must either be $1$
or a prime number at most the number of cows in the current room, and removes
$P$ cows from the current room.After both farmers have taken turns, both farmers move to the next room  in
the circular barn. That is, if the farmers are in room $i$, then they move to
room $i+1$, unless they are in room $N$, in which case they move to room
$1$.
Determine the farmer that wins the game if both farmers play optimally.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input contains $T$ test cases. The first line contains  $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 1000$).  Each of the $T$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing $N$, followed by a line containing
$a_1,\dots,a_N$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $N$ is at most
$2\cdot 10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case, output the farmer that wins the game, either "Farmer John"
or "Farmer Nhoj."

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
1
4
1
9
2
2 3
2
7 10
3
4 9 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Farmer Nhoj
Farmer John
Farmer John
Farmer John
Farmer Nhoj

For the first test case, Farmer John can remove $1$, $2$, or $3$ cows from  the
first room. Whichever number he removes, Nhoj can remove the remaining cow(s),
forcing FJ to lose when they circle back to the first room.

For the second test case, FJ can remove $5$ cows, forcing Nhoj to work with only
$4$ cows remaining. Now, Nhoj can either remove $1$, $2$, or $3$ cows. This is
now similar to the first test case.

For the third and fourth test cases, FJ can immediately remove all the cows from
the first room, forcing Nhoj to lose.

For the fifth test case, FJ can remove $1$, $2$, or $3$, cows from the first
room, and Nhoj can remove the rest right after. When they circle back around to
the first room, FJ will lose.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4 satisfy $N=1$.Inputs 1, 2, and 5-7 satisfy $a_i\le 1000$.Inputs 8-20 satisfy no additional constraints.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T20:54:49] thinking

**Analyzing game mechanics**

If \(a_i\) is prime, John wins immediately, which means that in any scenario where \(i=1\) is prime, he secures an instant win. In later rooms, if \(a_i\) turns
 out non-prime, John can only remove composite numbers, which means he can’t remove any since composite numbers must be greater than 1. In contrast, Nhoj has th
e chance to win if after John's turn, \(r_i\) is prime, allowing Nhoj to choose \(P_2\) equal to \(r_i\).
**Exploring game strategies**

John is focused on picking \(P_1\) to prevent Nhoj from winning, specifically avoiding leaving \(r_i\) as prime. If he can't do that, he loses right away. He ca
n choose \(P_1\) to make \(r_i\) composite, allowing Nhoj to pick \(P_2\) that will affect \(s_i\). They continue until someone's unable to move. The game opera
tes in a cycle of rooms, where strategies determine their moves. If any \(a_i > 1\), John usually wins unless scenarios dictate otherwise, as shown by the examp
le where John always loses with \(N=1\) and \(a_1=4\).
**Examining winning strategies**

If John chooses \(P_1\) to leave \(s_i\) as composite, Nhoj will then pick \(P_2\) to minimize John's chances of winning. This leads to a sequence of moves wher
e they may not return to previous rooms unless there’s a cycle without a win. The outcome hinges on the first room where either player wins.

For each room, if \(a_i\) is 1 or prime, it results in an immediate win for John. If \(a_i\) is composite and doesn’t lead to a winning move for John, it’s a lo
sing room for him. They keep cycling through until a definitive winner is decided or if they continually loop without resolution.
**Analyzing losing conditions**

I’m looking at safe configurations of numbers and their outcomes. For various values, like \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 6 \), I see that John wins in most cases unles
s it’s specifically 4, where Nhoj wins. Essentially, I can simplify by scanning the values: if \( a_i \) is 1, prime, or a composite greater than 4, John wins.
If it’s exactly 4, Nhoj wins.

This leads me to conclude that the first room's outcome generally determines the game's direction, making the approach to check just that a1 value quite efficie
nt.
**Implementing the solution**

I realize that the sample input doesn’t really test cases beyond \( N = 2 \) with a prime in room 1, which feels trivial. I'm recalling similar problems, like t
he "circular game," but probably need to focus on the USACO Gold January 2020 problem, "Circular Barn."

Given the time constraints, I think I'll stick to my earlier plan: scan through each room from 1 to \( N \). If I find a prime or 1, I'll declare John the winne
r. If I encounter a 4, Nhoj wins; otherwise, I’ll continue. If all rooms are checked without a winner, John is the default.

I’ll need to implement a sieve to determine primality, which should handle numbers up to \( 5 \times 10^6 \), as this is the max for \( a_i \). I'll set up the
sieve once per program to handle multiple test cases efficiently. Next, I’ll put together my restatement of the problem, conceptualize the solution, and write o
ut the pseudocode before saving everything in a solution.py file.  Let's get to coding!

Here’s the breakdown:

**Problem Restatement**
We have a circular sequence of rooms, each with a pile of cows. Two players alternate removing cows from the current room: first John, then Nhoj. Valid removals
 are either 1 or any prime ≤ the pile size. If on your turn the pile is empty, you lose. After both moves (if neither loses), they move to the next room (wrappi
ng around) and repeat indefinitely until someone loses.

We need to predict, under optimal play, who wins.

**Solution Concept**
- Only two “deciding” cases per room when first visited:
  - If the pile is 1 or a prime, John can remove all cows immediately and win.
  - If the pile is exactly 4, any removal by John (1 or a prime) leaves 3,2,1 (all prime/1), so Nhoj then empties it and John loses.
- Every other composite (>4) is “safe”: John can make a move that avoids giving Nhoj an immediate win, so they move on to the next room.
- Thus, scan rooms in order. At the first room where its size is 1 or prime, John wins; if it’s 4, Nhoj wins. Otherwise continue. If no room triggers, John even
tually forces a win.

**Pseudocode**
```
read T
collect all tests and track max_ai
sieve primes up to max_ai
for each test:
    winner = John (default)
    for each a in rooms:
        if a == 1 or is_prime[a]:
            winner = John; break
        if a == 4:
            winner = Nhoj; break
    print winner
```

The full implementation is in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like to run tests or explore further!
