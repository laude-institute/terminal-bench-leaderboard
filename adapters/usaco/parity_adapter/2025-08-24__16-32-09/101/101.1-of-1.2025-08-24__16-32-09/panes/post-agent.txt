[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Simplifying the Farm [Nathan Pinsker, 2011]

Farmer John has been taking an evening algorithms course at his local
university, and he has just learned about minimum spanning trees.  However,
Farmer John now realizes that the design of his farm is not as efficient as
it could be, and he wants to simplify the layout of his farm.

The farm is currently arranged like a graph, with vertices representing
fields and edges representing pathways between these fields, each having an
associated length.  Farmer John notes that for each distinct length,
at most three pathways on his farm share this length.  FJ would like to
remove some of the pathways on his farm so that it becomes a tree -- that
is, so that there is one unique route between any pair of fields.  Moreover,
Farmer John would like this to be a minimum spanning tree -- a tree having
the smallest possible sum of edge lengths.

Help Farmer John compute not only the sum of edge lengths in a minimum
spanning tree derived from his farm graph, but also the number of different
possible minimum spanning trees he can create.

PROBLEM NAME: simplify

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers N and M (1 <= N <= 40,000; 1 <= M <= 100,000),
        representing  the number of vertices and edges in the farm
        graph, respectively.  Vertices are numbered as 1..N.

* Lines 2..M+1: Three integers a_i, b_i and n_i (1 <= a_i, b_i <= N; 1
        <= n_i <= 1,000,000)  representing an edge from vertex a_i to
        b_i with length n_i.  No edge length n_i will occur more than
        three times.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 5
1 2 1
3 4 1
1 3 2
1 4 2
2 3 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers representing the length of the minimal spanning
        tree and the number of minimal spanning trees (mod
        1,000,000,007).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4 3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Picking both edges with length 1 and any edge with length 2 yields a minimum
spanning tree of length 4.

**Understanding MST Counting**

I need to implement a solution for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) weight and the count of distinct MSTs, using modulo \(1e9+7\). The constraints are pr
etty high: N up to 40k and M up to 100k, with edge weights reaching \(1e6\) and each weight appearing at most three times.

To count the number of MSTs, I can apply Kruskal's algorithm. I'll group edges by their weights, then focus on those connecting different components and figure
out which edges are optional based on the components formed.
**Counting Spanning Forests**

I need to count the number of ways to select a maximal acyclic set that spans connecting components, which essentially means counting the spanning forests in a
certain contraction graph. If there are k connected components in my current disjoint set union (DSU), I'll identify them as vertices. For edges of the current
weight, I’ll focus on those with different DSU roots.

This forms a graph where I need to pick a forest with a specific number of edges to properly connect the components. The trick will be to count the successful u
nions based on the number of edges available, while being cautious about how many edges already exist in the graph.
**Calculating Spanning Trees in CCs**

I need to connect nodes in each connected component (CC) using exactly \(n_c - 1\) edges, where \(n_c\) is the number of nodes in that component. Even if we hav
e multiple edges, there could be cycles, so I must avoid those while forming a spanning tree.

For each weight, I can start by initializing the disjoint set union (DSU), sorting edges by their weights, and then iterating through groups of edges. When conn
ecting nodes, I'll use depth-first search or union-find to find CCs and then calculate the number of spanning trees using subsets. Given the constraint that eac
h weight has at most three edges, this approach is manageable. After counting, I'll apply unions and ensure I account for the weights correctly.

I’ve implemented the MST weight calculation and counted the number of distinct MSTs via Kruskal’s grouping-by-weight and local enumeration of spanning trees per
 weight-group component. The solution is in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or edge-case checks!
