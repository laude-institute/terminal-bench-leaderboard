[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bovine Ballet [Brian Dean, 2013]

In an attempt to challenge the stereotypical perception of cows as awkward
creatures, Farmer John's prize cow Bessie has signed up for an introductory
ballet class.  Her final performance is next week, and FJ wants to help her
by building a rectangular stage large enough so that she can perform her
entire dance without falling off the edges.

Bessie's dance will take place on a rectangular stage consisting of a grid
of 1 x 1 square cells.  Bessie's four feet are described concisely as follows:

FR: Front right foot
FL: Front left foot
RR: Rear right foot
RL: Rear left foot

Her four feet start out in 4 adjacent cells forming a square as follows,
with Bessie facing north.

FL FR
RL RR

Bessie's dance follows a series of N instructions (1 <= N <= 1000), where
each instruction tells her to either move one foot by one cell or to pivot
90 degrees clockwise.

Instructions to move a foot consist of 3 characters, the first two
identifying the foot to move, and the final character specifying the
direction of movement (F = forward, B = back, R = right, L = left).  For
example, "FRF" means Bessie should move her front right foot forward one
cell, and "RLR" means she should move her rear left foot right one cell.
Of course, the direction of movement is relative to the direction Bessie is
facing.

Instruction to pivot are also 3 characters, the first two specifying the
single foot that Bessie keeps planted, around which she rotates 90 degrees
clockwise.  The last character is "P" (for pivot).  For example, the
instruction "FRP" means Bessie should pivot 90 degrees clockwise about her
stationary front right foot.  This means that if her feet are currently
situated as follows (with Bessie facing north)

.. .. ..
.. .. FR
.. FL ..
.. RL RR

then the after the instruction "FRP" her feet will be located as follows,
with Bessie now facing east:

RL FL ..
RR .. FR
.. .. ..
.. .. ..

Given the N instructions in Bessie's dance, please compute the minimum area
of a rectangular stage necessary contain her feet during the entire dance.

If Bessie clumsily ever moves one foot onto the same cell as another foot,
she will trip and fail to complete the dance; in this case, please output
-1.  Note that this is the only case where Bessie will trip; she has become
quite flexible after all her practice, and can easily move her feet into
rather strange configurations (for example, with her back feet farther
forward than her front feet).

PROBLEM NAME: ballet

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the 3-character instructions
        in Bessie's dance.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
FRF
FRP
RLB

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie's dance consists of the instructions "front right foot forward",
"front right foot pivot", and "rear left foot back".

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum area of a rectangular stage necessary to contain
        Bessie's feet during the entire dance, or -1 if Bessie trips.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

16

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie needs a 4 x 4 stage to complete her dance.  Her feet move as follows:

.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. (facing north)
.. .. FL FR
.. .. RL RR

After FRF:

.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. FR (facing north)
.. .. FL ..
.. .. RL RR

After FRP:

.. RL FL ..
.. RR .. FR (facing east)
.. .. .. ..
.. .. .. ..

After RLB:

[2025-08-24T21:10:33] thinking

**Processing movement instructions**

I see that we have a 4x4 area, which gives us 16 units to work with. I need to process each instruction step by step while tracking the boundaries and updating
my position. Keeping orientations as integers – 0 for north, 1 for east, and so on – will help with movement. When instructions involve moving forward, backward
, or turning, I’ll adjust coordinates accordingly and rotate positions. It’s essential to capture initial positions too, starting with FL at (-1, 1).
**Defining initial positions**

I’m establishing the starting coordinates for Bessie in the grid. I have FL at (0,1), FR at (1,1), RL at (0,0), and RR at (1,0). This setup matches what I need,
 with FL and FR on the first row, and RL and RR below. After the first move for FR, it shifts from (1,1) to (1,2). I’ll update the boundaries accordingly and ca
lculate the new positions for the other feet based on this pivot. For example, FL’s new position becomes (0,3). Next, I’ll check the movements for the rear left
 foot.
**Reassessing boundaries and positions**

I’m delving into the boundaries we set: minX is -2, and maxX is 1, giving width of 4. The minY and maxY were confusing, though; I need to ensure I’m capturing a
ll positions. The sample shows a stage area of 16, which suggests I initially missed the range of movements. The pivot calculations seem correct in principle, b
ut I need to keep track of every position throughout the dance. I also need a way to check for duplicate positions among the feet.
**Planning movement instructions**

I'm mapping out how to handle movements based on instructions. I'll parse the first two characters for the foot, and the third for direction or pivot. If it isn
't a pivot, I’ll determine the direction index using an orientation mapping. I have to be careful with direction adjustments and calculate the new position corr
ectly using given deltas. Once I handle the pivots, I'll check for trips and update coordinates accordingly. Finally, I’ll compute the area after all instructio
ns and write my solution step-by-step in a clean format.

Here’s a walkthrough and the complete Python solution.

1. Restatement
Bessie’s four feet start in a 2×2 block on an infinite grid, facing north. We receive N instructions: either move one foot one cell (F/B/L/R, relative to her cu
rrent facing) or pivot 90° clockwise around one planted foot. We must simulate all moves, detect if any two feet ever collide (output –1), and otherwise report
the minimum rectangular stage area that contains all foot‐positions seen at any time.

2. Conceptual solution
- Label feet “FL”, “FR”, “RL”, “RR” and store their (x,y) coordinates.
- Track Bessie’s facing as 0=north,1=east,2=south,3=west.
- For a move instruction: pick the foot, compute the absolute direction by rotating the relative command by her facing, and step it by one.
- For a pivot: leave the pivot foot fixed, rotate each other foot 90° clockwise around it, and increment facing.
- After each update, check for duplicate positions (trip). Also update global min/max x,y across all four feet.
- At end, if no trip, area = (max_x–min_x+1)*(max_y–min_y+1).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
feet = {FL:(0,1), FR:(1,1), RL:(0,0), RR:(1,0)}
facing = 0
init min_x,max_x,min_y,max_y from feet

for i in 1..N:
  instr = read()
  foot = instr[:2]
  cmd = instr[2]
  if cmd == 'P':   # pivot
    pivot_pos = feet[foot]
    for other in feet except pivot:
      dx = feet[other].x - pivot.x
      dy = feet[other].y - pivot.y
      new_dx = dy
      new_dy = -dx
      feet[other] = (pivot.x+new_dx, pivot.y+new_dy)
    facing = (facing+1)%4
  else:            # move
    dir_map = {'F':0,'R':1,'B':2,'L':3}
    dir_idx = (facing + dir_map[cmd])%4
    delta = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)][dir_idx]
    feet[foot] = feet[foot] + delta
  if any two feet share coords:
    print(-1); exit
  update min_x,max_x,min_y,max_y from feet

print((max_x-min_x+1)*(max_y-min_y+1))
```

4. solution.py

    deltas = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]
    rel_dir = {'F': 0, 'R': 1, 'B': 2, 'L': 3}
