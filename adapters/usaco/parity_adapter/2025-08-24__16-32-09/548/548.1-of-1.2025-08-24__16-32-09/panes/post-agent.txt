[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's farm is in the shape of an $N \times N$ grid of fields ($2 \le N \le 18$),
each labeled with a letter in the alphabet.  For example:

ABCD
BXZX
CDXB
WCBA

Each day, Bessie the cow walks from the upper-left field to the lower-right
field, each step taking her either one field to the right or one field downward.
Bessie keeps track of the string that she generates during this process, built
from the letters she walks across.  She gets very disoriented, however, if this
string is a palindrome (reading the same forward as backward), since she gets
confused about which direction she had walked.
Please help Bessie determine the number of different palindromes she can form
during her walk.  Different ways of forming the same palindrome only count once;
for example, there are several routes that yield the palindrome ABXZXBA above,
but there are only four distinct palindromes Bessie can form, ABCDCBA, ABCWCBA,
ABXZXBA, ABXDXBA.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the remaining $N$ lines contain the $N$ rows
of the grid of fields.  Each row contains $N$ characters that are in the range
A..Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of distinct palindromes Bessie can form.

SAMPLE INPUT:4
ABCD
BXZX
CDXB
WCBA
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 4

**Analyzing palindrome paths**

I’m focusing on the layer k = N-1, where the coordinates (i,j) satisfy i+j = N-1, identifying middle cells. The path from the start reaches one of these cells,
and similarly from the end. I need to compute all prefix strings that lead to each middle cell, along with suffix strings from the end. For a palindrome, the pr
efix ought to match the suffix reversed. Since L = 2N-1, the prefix contains the middle character, and the suffix excludes it. Thus, I conclude that the prefix
must equal the reverse of the suffix.
**Designing palindrome search**

I’ve noted that both strings s and t are of length N, so I can precompute sets of s for each middle position and the reversed t. Whenever a prefix matches a rev
ersed suffix, it forms a palindrome. I’ll need to implement a method for searching these paths using a depth-first or breadth-first approach, but the combinatio
ns are skyrocketing in scale to around 2.3 billion for larger N values, making enumeration infeasible.

Instead, a dynamic programming approach using sets per cell could help, although the potential sizes might be exponential if every path yields a unique string.
I could also try a meeting-in-the-middle strategy to manage the complexity better. Ultimately, integrating a search with memoization for counting distinct palin
dromes could work. I’m leaning towards a depth-first approach with pruning for efficiency, where I’ll build and maintain palindromic strings symmetrically from
both ends of the grid as I traverse.
**Implementing the palindrome search**

I realize that since L is odd, the two drones meet at a middle cell, which makes r1 equal to r2 and c1 equal to c2. I can use depth-first search (DFS) with step
s that account for depth. I’ll skip states where the characters at the current positions don’t match. I initially consider the grid's corners and build a string
 by checking positions, ensuring I only form palindromes when the starting and ending letters match.

From there, I iterate through possible moves and store valid palindrome strings while expanding my search. The challenge lies in managing potential string sizes
, as I need to avoid duplicates to reduce complexity. With memoization, I can manage states more effectively, focusing on generating distinct palindromic string
s across the grid, while ensuring I prune unnecessary paths. Overall, this approach should efficiently yield the count of unique palindromes in a reasonable tim
eframe.

I’ve added `solution.py` with a meet-in-the-middle DP that builds matching half-path strings and counts distinct palindromes. Let me know if you’d like any test
s or further tweaks!
