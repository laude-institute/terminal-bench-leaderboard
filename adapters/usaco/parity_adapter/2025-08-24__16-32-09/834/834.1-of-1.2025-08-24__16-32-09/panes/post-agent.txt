[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Keeping an eye on long term career possibilities beyond the farm, Bessie the cow
has started learning algorithms from various on-line coding websites.

Her favorite algorithm thus far is "bubble sort".  Here is Bessie's
implementation, in cow-code, for sorting an array $A$ of length $N$.


sorted = false
while (not sorted):
   sorted = true
   moo
   for i = 0 to N-2:
      if A[i+1] < A[i]:
         swap A[i], A[i+1]
         sorted = false

Apparently, the "moo" command in cow-code does nothing more than print out
"moo".  Strangely, Bessie seems to insist on including it at various points in
her code.

Given an input array, please predict how many times "moo" will be printed by
Bessie's code.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$).  The next $N$
lines  describe $A[0] \ldots A[N-1]$, each being an integer in the range
$0 \ldots 10^9$. Input elements are not guaranteed to be distinct.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the number of times "moo" is printed.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
1
5
3
8
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

[2025-08-24T20:40:06] thinking

**Analyzing bubble sort**

I’m working on understanding Bessie’s bubble sort problem, where it prints "moo" with each pass of the outer loop. The goal is to count passes until the array i
s sorted. The traditional bubble sort has an O(N^2) worst-case, which feels slow for large inputs. Still, I just need to count the passes before sorting is comp
lete. Each pass moves the largest unsorted element to the end, and we can track how many passes result in swaps to determine the total "moo" counts.
**Calculating bubble sort passes**

Let’s think about how each element needs to move to its correct position. The total number of passes is determined by the maximum displacement to the left plus
one. Bubble sort generally requires calculating the difference between the original index and the sorted index for each element, especially since maintaining st
ability with duplicates is important.

For each element, I’ll compute the delta between these indices. The maximum delta gives us the number of passes required, plus one additional pass to check if t
he array is sorted. If it’s already sorted, the answer is 1 since no movement is needed. I'll create an implementation plan with the necessary steps.
**Preparing the solution**

I need to sort pairs based on their values while keeping the original index for stability. I’ll compute the delta for each element to see how far it needs to mo
ve and track the maximum delta. The final answer will be that maximum delta plus one.

I’ll provide four outputs as requested: a plain English restatement of the problem, a conceptual solution, pseudocode, and then create a `solution.py` file with
 the implementation. The code will avoid external libraries and leverage built-in sorting functionality. Alright, let's get started!

1. **Problem Restatement**
Given an integer array, Bessie’s bubble sort implementation prints “moo” once per full pass until the array is sorted (including a final pass with no swaps). De
termine how many times “moo” is printed.

2. **Solution Concept**
Bubble sort moves each element left at most one position per pass. The number of passes needed before sorted is the maximum leftward distance any element travel
s, plus one final check-pass. By comparing each element’s original index to its index in the stably sorted array, we find the maximum displacement.

3. **Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array A with original indices
form list of (value, original_index) pairs
stably sort pairs by value then original_index
max_delta = 0
for sorted_index, (_, original_index) in sorted list:
    delta = original_index - sorted_index
    max_delta = max(max_delta, delta)
print(max_delta + 1)
```

4. **Saved File**
The complete Python solution is in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
