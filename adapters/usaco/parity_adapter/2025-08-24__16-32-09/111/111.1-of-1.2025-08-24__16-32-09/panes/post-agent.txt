[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Bovine Alliance [Mark Gordon, 2011]

Bessie and her bovine pals from nearby farms have finally decided that they
are going to start connecting their farms together by trails in an effort
to form an alliance against the farmers.  The cows in each of the N (1 <= N
<= 100,000) farms were initially instructed to build a trail to exactly one
other farm, for a total of N trails.  However months into the project only
M (1 <= M < N) of these trails had actually been built.

Arguments between the farms over which farms already built a trail now
threaten to split apart the cow alliance.  To ease tension, Bessie wishes
to calculate how many ways the M trails that exist so far could have been
built.  For example, if there is a trail connecting farms 3 and 4, then one
possibility is that farm 3 built the trail, and the other possibility is
that farm 4 built the trail.  Help Bessie by calculating the number of
different assignments of trails to the farms that built them, modulo
1,000,000,007.  Two assignments are considered different if there is at
least one trail built by a different farm in each assignment.

PROBLEM NAME: alliance

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers N and M

* Lines 2..1+M: Line i+1 describes the ith trail.  Each line contains
        two space-separated integers u_i and v_i (1 <= u_i, v_i <= N,
        u_i != v_i) describing the pair of farms connected by the
        trail.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 4
1 2
3 2
4 5
4 5

INPUT DETAILS:

Note that there can be two trails between the same pair of farms.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line containing the number of assignments of trails
        to farms, taken modulo 1,000,000,007.  If no assignment
        satisfies the above conditions output 0.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 possible assignments.  Letting {a,b,c,d} mean that farm 1
builds trail a, farm 2 builds trail b, farm 3 builds trail c, and farm 4
builds trail d, the assignments are:
{2, 3, 4, 5}
{2, 3, 5, 4}
{1, 3, 4, 5}
{1, 3, 5, 4}
{1, 2, 4, 5}
{1, 2, 5, 4}

**Evaluating tree orientations**

I'm considering the components that are trees and wondering about their number of orientations. For a tree with k nodes and k-1 edges—essentially an acyclic con
nected component—the valid orientations of edges is k. This is because we can orient the edges to ensure that the maximum out-degree is at most 1. Given that it
's a forest, it seems that the number of orientations corresponds to choosing a root, which is the unique node with an out-degree of 0.
**Analyzing tree orientation assignments**

In a tree, assigning orientations equates to selecting one node as the root and directing all edges toward it, ensuring each non-root node has an out-degree of
one to its parent. For components with one cycle, we have k nodes and k edges. When orienting edges, nodes on the cycle must have out-degrees of one, forming a
directed cycle, while tree attachments need to point towards the cycle. Each attached tree offers its own single orientation, ensuring that the orientations are
 accurately directed towards the cycle to avoid issues with out-degrees.
**Designing a DSU for edge orientation**

I'm considering using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to count and manage edges for undirected graphs. I want to initialize sizes and edge counts as I union nodes. F
or each edge, I’ll identify the roots and adjust the edge counts accordingly, ensuring that if a component exceeds its node count with edges, I return zero. In
cycles, there are specific possibilities; trees yield multiple orientations. I’ll handle isolated nodes properly and write a python script for the solution with
out using extra libraries.

[2025-08-24T22:07:23] codex

I’ve added **solution.py** implementing the DSU-based approach:

- Restates problem: orient each trail so no farm builds more than one.
- Identifies components as trees (k ways) or single cycles (2 ways).
- Counts orientations via union-find, tracking node and edge counts.
- Outputs 0 for invalid components.

Let me know if you’d like to run tests or further checks!
