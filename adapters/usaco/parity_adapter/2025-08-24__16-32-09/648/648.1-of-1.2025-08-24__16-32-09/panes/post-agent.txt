[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  does
find the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.

She is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.
The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \leq N
\leq 262,144$), each in the range $1 \ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessie
can take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a
single number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two
adjacent 7s with an 8). The goal is to maximize the value of the
largest number present in the sequence at the end of the game.  Please
help Bessie score as highly as possible!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the next $N$ lines give the sequence
of $N$ numbers at the start of the game.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1
1
1
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to
obtain the sequence 1 2 2, and then she merges the 2s into a 3.  Note that it is
not optimal to join the first two 1s.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T22:32:27] thinking

**Exploring merging numbers**

I'm tackling the well-known "248" problem, where I need to merge adjacent equal numbers to maximize the highest merged number. Given that N can be as large as 2
62,144, I think of using a dynamic programming approach with a stack. The classic method involves keeping track of the rightmost indices for blocks of matching
values. Still, the greedy stack approach seems more efficient. I'll need to keep testing whether this greedy method actually provides the optimal solution, as i
t may not always yield the maximum.
**Evaluating merging strategies**

Next, my stack merges [2, 2] into [3], but [3, 2] doesn’t merge, giving a max of 3. I ponder whether this greedy approach is always optimal. The known problem “
248” suggests that greedily merging maximizes results, yet this isn’t it; it's more like “262144.” With constraints allowing up to 262k, I think I might need a
segment tree and DP for efficiency. It’s intriguing that different merge orders can yield the same maximum. While people say greediness works, I’m still ponderi
ng possible counterexamples.
**Refining the merging algorithm**

I need to ensure my merging algorithm includes initial occurrences of values, not just merges. The dp approach has to treat each a[i] as its own segment. When s
etting values, I think I should use dp_cur to capture starting positions where a[i] equals v. The algorithm will iterate through the array to compute merges eff
iciently. While the complexity may be around 30 million operations, I should optimize it by precomputing positions for each value to avoid unnecessary checks. T
his will streamline merging and make the process more efficient.
**Developing the merging algorithm**

I’m mapping out my algorithm. First, I'll read the array and determine its maximum value. I’ll create a dictionary mapping values to their indices. The dynamic
programming setup will manage previous and current states, making sure I capture both initial occurrences and merges. As I iterate, I'll update max answers and
control complexity, aiming for efficiency with linear operations. Finally, I’ll implement everything in a solution file while following the user’s request to re
state the problem, conceptualize the approach, and provide pseudocode. Now it’s time to generate the code and create the solution file.

Here’s the complete Python solution:

1. Restated
   Given a list of N positive integers, you can repeatedly merge two equal adjacent numbers into one number that’s one greater. Find the maximum number you can
end up with.

2. Conceptual Solution
   • Track all contiguous segments that can reduce to a value v.
   • For v starting at 1, record singletons (initial occurrences) and merged segments.
   • For each higher v, combine adjacent segments from v−1, plus any initial singletons of v.
   • Stop when no segments form for the next value.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read N and array arr
   map pos[v] = list of indices i with arr[i]=v
   maxans = max(arr)
   dp_prev[i] = i for all i where arr[i]=1, else -1
   v = 2
   while True:
     dp_cur = [-1]*N, starts_cur=[]
     for i in pos[v]: mark dp_cur[i]=i, record starts_cur, update maxans
     for i in starts_prev:
       mid = dp_prev[i]; nxt = mid+1
       if nxt<N and dp_prev[nxt]!=-1:
         dp_cur[i] = dp_prev[nxt]; record starts_cur; update maxans
     if starts_cur empty: break
     dp_prev, starts_prev = dp_cur, starts_cur
     v += 1
   print maxans
   ```

4. Implementation
The solution is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
