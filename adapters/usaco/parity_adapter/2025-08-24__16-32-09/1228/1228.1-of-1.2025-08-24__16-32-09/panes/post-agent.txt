[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is hiding somewhere along the number line. Each of Farmer John's
$N$ other cows ($1\le N\le 1000$) have a piece of information to share: the
$i$-th cow either says that Bessie is hiding at some location less than or equal
to $p_i$, or that Bessie is hiding at some location greater than or equal to
$p_i$
($0\le p_i\le 10^9$).

Unfortunately, it is possible that no hiding location is consistent with the
answers of all of the cows, meaning that not all of the cows are telling the
truth.  Count the minimum number of cows that must be lying.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain either L or G, followed by an integer $p_i$. L
means that the $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location is less than  or
equal to $p_i$, and G means that $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location
is greater than or equal to $p_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The minimum number of cows that must be lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0

It is possible that no cow is lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

At least one of the cows must be lying.

**Clarifying the Python task**

The user wants a Python solution broken down into several steps. First, I need to restate the problem in simple terms: we have cows making statements about a lo
cation \( x \), and these statements could be inconsistent.

Next, I need to conceptualize a solution using plain language, then write pseudocode. Finally, I'll save the completed code in a file named `solution.py`. It's
important to note that no outside libraries can be used, and I have to consider a certain range for \( N \) and \( p_i \). The goal is to minimize the number of
 lies from inconsistent statements.
**Analyzing cow statements**

To determine the number of lies based on x's value, I'll count the cows making contradictory statements. Specifically, if \( x \) is greater than a cow's statem
ent \( p_i \) indicating \( x \leq p_i \), it's a lie, and vice versa.

To minimize these lies, I’ll only evaluate \( x \) at known \( p_i \) values, since they don't change the lie count until crossing specific thresholds. Unique \
( p_i \) values will be collected, and I’ll check the lie counts at each to find the optimal \( x \). This approach is manageable even with 1000 cows, and prefi
x sums might simplify it, but a brute-force method works too.
**Implementing cow truth counts**

For each possible value of \( x \), I need to count the number of true statements made by cows. Cows saying \( L \) are truthful if \( p_i \geq x \) and those s
aying \( G \) are truthful if \( p_i \leq x \).

I’ll create arrays for \( p_i \) values and use a brute-force approach, as it seems simpler for this problem. My next steps include restating the problem, conce
ptualizing the solution, developing pseudocode, and finally writing the code to a file named `solution.py`. I’ll inform the user about creating this file before
 proceeding with the implementation.

Here’s the breakdown and solution:

1. Restatement
   We have N cows each claiming Bessie’s hiding spot is either “≤ pᵢ” or “≥ pᵢ”. We need to pick a location x to minimize the number of incorrect statements (li
es).

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Any candidate x will only change lie-count when passing a stated pᵢ, so it suffices to test x at each pᵢ.
   - For each x = pᵢ, count cows whose statement fails:
     - If they said “L p” and x > p, it’s a lie.
     - If they said “G p” and x < p, it’s a lie.
   - Track the minimum lies over all candidates.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list of (type, p) for each cow
best = N
for each candidate p_c in list:
    lies = 0
    for each (type, p):
        if type == 'L' and p_c > p: lies += 1
        if type == 'G' and p_c < p: lies += 1
    best = min(best, lies)
print(best)
```

4. The implementation has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py`.
