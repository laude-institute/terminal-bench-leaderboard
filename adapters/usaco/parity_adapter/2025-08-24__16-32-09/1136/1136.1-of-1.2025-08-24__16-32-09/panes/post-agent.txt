[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow has enrolled in a computer science PhD program, driven by her
love of computer science and also the  allure of one day becoming "Dr. Bessie".
Having worked for some time on her academic research, she has now published  $N$
papers ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$), and her $i$-th paper has accumulated $c_i$
citations ($0 \leq c_i \leq 10^5$) from other papers in the research literature.

Bessie has heard that an academic's success can be measured by their $h$-index.
The $h$-index is the largest number $h$ such that the researcher has at least
$h$ papers each with at least $h$ citations. For example, a researcher with $4$
papers and respective citation counts $(1,100,2,3)$ has an $h$-index of $2$,
whereas if the citation counts were $(1,100,3,3)$ then the $h$-index would be
$3$.

To up her $h$-index, Bessie is planning to write up to $K$ survey articles
($0 \leq K \leq 10^5$), each citing many of her past papers. However,  due to
page limits, she can only cite at most $L$ papers in each survey
($0 \leq L \leq 10^5$). Of course, no paper may be cited multiple times in a
single survey (but a paper may be cited in several surveys).

Help Bessie determine the maximum $h$-index she may achieve after writing these
survey articles. Bessie is not allowed to cite a survey from one of her surveys.

Note that Bessie's research advisor should probably inform her at some point
that writing a survey solely to increase one's $h$ index is ethically dubious;
other academics are not recommended to follow Bessie's example here.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$, $K$, and $L$.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $c_1,\ldots, c_N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The maximum $h$-index on a single line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 4 1
1 100 1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, Bessie may write up to $4$ survey articles, each citing at most $1$ paper.
If she cites each of her first and third articles twice, then her $h$-index
becomes
$3$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 1 4
1 100 1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

In this second example, Bessie may write at most a single article. If Bessie cites any
of her first, third, or fourth papers at least once, her $h$-index becomes $2$.

[2025-08-24T20:55:33] thinking

**Conceptualizing the solution**

The user is asking me to break down a problem into simpler steps. First, I need to restate the problem clearly in plain English and then devise a solution conce
pt. After that, I’ll write pseudocode to outline the logic before creating a Python file called solution.py for the final implementation. I realize I need to fo
cus on managing citations within the constraints of surveys and papers. This should lead me through the reasoning about the h-index and the citation limits effe
ctively.
**Analyzing citation distribution**

I'm thinking about how citations can be spread across different surveys for the same paper. Each paper can receive up to K new citations, but the total distribu
ted citations cannot exceed K times L. To achieve a target h-index, we need at least h papers with citations of at least h. For papers with fewer citations, I n
eed to ensure that the required additional citations are feasible within the limits. Essentially, I must verify if I can adjust citations for sufficient papers
to meet the h-index requirement.
**Optimizing h-index calculation**

I need to determine the number of papers needed to achieve a particular target h-index based on citation constraints. This involves calculating how many papers
have the required citations and which papers can be raised to meet the criterion. I must ensure that the sum of citations added does not exceed a defined limit
while keeping track of the papers eligible for citation increases. The calculations suggest a binary search approach within defined boundaries, ensuring efficie
ncy through pre-sorting and using prefix sums for quick lookups. This plan seems feasible and optimized.
**Preparing solution plan**

I need to handle edge cases where K or L equals zero, as this means no additional citations can be added. So, I’ll structure my approach with the following step
s: First, I will restate the problem clearly. Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution and write pseudocode to outline the logic. Finally, I’ll draft the actual co
de for solution.py, ensuring it adheres to formatting guidelines and efficiently handles input. My final output will incorporate all these elements before creat
ing the solution.py file.

**Restatement**
- Given N papers with citation counts c_i, and the ability to add citations via up to K surveys (each cites ≤ L distinct papers), compute the maximum h-index ac
hievable.
- The h-index is the largest h such that at least h papers have ≥ h citations.

**Solution Concept**
- Sort citation counts ascending and build a prefix-sum array.
- Binary-search the answer h in [0, N].
- For a candidate h:
  - Let num_free = number of papers already ≥ h.
  - If num_free ≥ h, it’s feasible.
  - Else need_count = h − num_free papers upgraded from below h to h.
  - A paper with c_i < h can be upgraded only if c_i + K ≥ h (max K citations per paper).
  - Among these eligible papers, pick the need_count with largest c_i (minimize added citations).
  - Total citations needed = need_count⋅h − sum(selected c_i) ≤ total available citations K⋅L.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K, L
read list c of size N
sort c
build prefix sums pref
define feasible(h):
    idx = first index where c[idx] ≥ h
    num_free = N − idx
    if num_free ≥ h: return True
    need = h − num_free
    left = first index where c[left] ≥ h−K
    if idx − left < need: return False
    # take papers c[idx-need .. idx-1]
    sum_c = pref[idx] − pref[idx−need]
    total_needed = need*h − sum_c
    return total_needed ≤ K*L

binary search h in [0..N] using feasible
print result
```
