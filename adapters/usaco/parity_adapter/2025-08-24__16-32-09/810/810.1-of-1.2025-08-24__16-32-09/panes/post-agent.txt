[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his personal trainer Bessie are hiking up Mount Vancowver. For
their purposes (and yours), the mountain can be represented as a long straight
trail of length $L$ meters ($1 \leq L \leq 10^6$). Farmer John will hike the
trail at a constant travel rate of $r_F$ seconds per meter
($1 \leq r_F \leq 10^6$). Since he is working on his stamina, he will not take
any rest stops along the way.

Bessie, however, is allowed to take rest stops, where she might find some tasty
grass. Of course, she cannot stop just anywhere! There are $N$ rest stops along
the trail ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$); the $i$-th stop is $x_i$ meters from the start
of the trail ($0 < x_i < L$) and has a tastiness value $c_i$
($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$). If Bessie rests at stop $i$ for $t$ seconds, she
receives $c_i \cdot t$ tastiness units.

When not at a rest stop, Bessie will be hiking at a fixed travel rate of $r_B$
seconds per meter ($1 \leq r_B \leq 10^6$). Since Bessie is young and fit, $r_B$
is strictly less than $r_F$.

Bessie would like to maximize her consumption of tasty grass. But she is worried
about Farmer John; she thinks that if at any point along the hike she is behind
Farmer John on the trail, he might lose all motivation to continue!

Help Bessie find the maximum total tastiness units she can obtain while making
sure that Farmer John completes the hike.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains four integers: $L$, $N$, $r_F$, and $r_B$. The
next $N$ lines describe the rest stops. For each $i$ between $1$ and $N$, the
$i+1$-st line contains two integers $x_i$ and $c_i$, describing the position of
the $i$-th rest stop and the tastiness of the grass there.

It is guaranteed that $r_F > r_B$, and $0 < x_1 < \dots < x_N < L $.  Note
that $r_F$ and $r_B$ are given in seconds per meter!

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single integer: the maximum total tastiness units Bessie can obtain.

SAMPLE INPUT:
10 2 4 3
7 2
8 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
15

In this example, it is optimal for Bessie to stop for $7$ seconds at the $x=7$ rest stop (acquiring $14$ tastiness units) and then stop for an additional $1$ se
cond at the $x=8$ rest stop (acquiring $1$ more tastiness unit, for a total of $15$ tastiness units).

**Explaining the Rest Stops problem**

The user wants a Python3 solution for the "Rest Stops" problem, which includes four parts: restating the problem, conceptualizing its approach, writing pseudoco
de, and finally saving the solution as solution.py. The key is to choose rest stops with the highest tastiness using a greedy strategy. I can start from the end
, find maximum tastiness stops, or maintain a decreasing stack of tastiness as I iterate through sorted stops. This way, I ensure Bessie stops at the best locat
ions in between. Finally, I’ll calculate the time difference.
**Clarifying the algorithm for rest stops**

I need to calculate the time difference for each segment between chosen rest stops based on their distances and tastiness values. First, I’ll use a stack to kee
p track of rest stops' tastiness values as I scan from left to right, marking only the highest as optimal. To improve efficiency, I can scan from right to left,
 identifying indices where each tastiness is greater than those on the right. I’ll gather these, reverse the list to maintain order, and then simulate the tasti
ness accumulation to find the total. The final output will be an integer.

**Problem Restatement**
We have a straight trail of length L metres. Farmer John walks at r_F seconds/m and never stops. Bessie walks faster at r_B seconds/m and can rest at any of the
 N stops along the way; stop i is at distance x_i with tastiness c_i per second of rest. Bessie wants to rack up as much tastiness as possible but must never fa
ll behind Farmer John at any point.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Bessie’s extra time per metre is Δ = r_F – r_B; over a segment of length d she can rest up to d·Δ seconds in total.
- She should only rest at stops that have higher tastiness than any stop ahead, because she can always trade resting time at a more delicious stop instead of a
less delicious one.
- Scan the rest stops from end to start, collecting those with strictly increasing tastiness (maxima). Reverse that list so it’s in trail order.
- For each chosen stop at position x with tastiness c, let d = x – previous_position; add d·Δ·c to the total. Update previous_position = x.

**Pseudocode**
```
read L, N, r_F, r_B
read list of (x_i, c_i) for i in 1..N
optimal = empty list
max_c = 0
for each rest stop in reversed order:
    if c_i > max_c:
        prepend (x_i, c_i) to optimal
        max_c = c_i
total = 0
prev = 0
delta = r_F - r_B
for each (x, c) in optimal:
    dist = x - prev
    total += dist * delta * c
    prev = x
print total
```

Now creating `solution.py` with this implementation.
