[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second.
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down.
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

PROBLEM NAME: slowdown

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The value of N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line is of the form "T x" or "D x", indicating a
        time event or a distance event.  In both cases, x is an
        integer that is guaranteed to place the event before Bessie
        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for
        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to
        slow down quite a bit all at once.  Events may not be listed
        in order.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
T 30
D 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2970

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds.
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her
980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T20:56:49] thinking

**Refining event logic**

I'm thinking I need to maintain counts of how many times events occur at each timestamp, as well as their distances. It seems smarter to sort the time and dista
nce events. I should use two indices, `i` for time and `j` for distance. Inside the loop, I'll need to check the time differences and distances. If they equal e
ach other, I'll apply both events at once, remembering to count any simultaneous time events. Finally, I'll ensure both sorted lists are fully processed.
**Computing time and distance events**

I need to compute the time difference (`dt_time`) and distance difference (`dt_dist`). Since speed is `1/(slow+1)`, I can express `dt_dist` as a function of bot
h distance to the next event and the slow factor. I realize that both next events will not exceed 1000 meters, so first, I'll calculate `dt_time` and `dt_dist`,
 then compare them. Depending on which is smaller, I'll adjust the time or distance accordingly and count events at those moments. Finally, I’ll finalize my sol
ution structure to prepare the coding part.

1. Problem Restatement
- Bessie starts skiing at 1 m/s, and each slowdown reduces her speed to 1/(k+1) m/s after k slowdowns.
- We are given N events, each either at a specific time T or distance D (both before 1000 m), where she slows down.
- Compute total time to cover 1000 m, rounding to nearest second (0.5 rounds up).

2. Solution Concept
- Track current time `t`, distance `d`, and slowdown count `k`.
- Maintain sorted lists of time-events and distance-events.
- Repeatedly determine which next event (by time or by distance) occurs first under current speed.
- Advance `t` and `d` to that event, apply all simultaneous events, increment `k`.
- After all events, cover remaining distance at final speed.
- Round the final time and output it.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
for each event:
    if 'T': add to times list
    else: add to distances list
sort times, distances

t, d, slow = 0, 0, 0
i, j = 0, 0
while there are remaining time or distance events:
    next_t = times[i] or INF
    next_d = distances[j] or INF
    dt_time = next_t - t
    dt_dist = (next_d - d) * (slow+1)
    if dt_time < dt_dist:
        advance d by dt_time/(slow+1), set t=next_t, apply all equal time events (increment slow)
    elif dt_time > dt_dist:
        advance t by dt_dist, set d=next_d, apply all equal distance events (increment slow)
    else:
        set t=next_t, d=next_d, apply both time and distance events (increment slow accordingly)
# finish remaining to 1000 m
if d<1000:
    t += (1000-d)*(slow+1)
print rounded(t)
```

4. Solution Code
The solution is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
