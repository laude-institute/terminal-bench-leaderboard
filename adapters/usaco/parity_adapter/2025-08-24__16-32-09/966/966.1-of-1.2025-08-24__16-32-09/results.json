    "instruction": "Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.\nReason through the problem and:\n1. Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nFarmer John's cows have recently become fans of playing a simple number game\ncalled \"FizzBuzz\".  The rules of the game are simple: standing in a circle, the\ncows sequentially count upward from one, each cow saying a single number when it\nis her turn.  If a cow ever reaches a multiple of 3, however, she should say\n\"Fizz\" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 5, she should say\n\"Buzz\" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 15, she should\nsay \"FizzBuzz\" instead of that number.  A transcript of the first part of a game\nis therefore:\n\n1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16\n\nHaving a slightly more limited vocabulary, the version of FizzBuzz played by the\ncows involves saying \"Moo\" instead of Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.  The beginning\nof the cow version of the game is therefore\n\n1, 2, Moo, 4, Moo, Moo, 7, 8, Moo, Moo, 11, Moo, 13, 14, Moo, 16\n\nGiven $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$), please determine the $N$th number spoken in\nthis game.\n\nSCORING\nTest cases 2-5 satisfy $N\\le 10^6.$ \n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe input consists of a single integer, $N$.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nPlease print out the $N$th number spoken during the game.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n4\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n7\n\nThe 4th number spoken is 7.  The first 4 numbers spoken are 1, 2, 4, 7, since we\nskip over any time a cow says \"Moo\".\n\n\nProblem credits: Brian Dean\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
