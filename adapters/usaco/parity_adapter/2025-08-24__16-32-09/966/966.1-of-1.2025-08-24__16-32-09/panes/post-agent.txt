[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's cows have recently become fans of playing a simple number game
called "FizzBuzz".  The rules of the game are simple: standing in a circle, the
cows sequentially count upward from one, each cow saying a single number when it
is her turn.  If a cow ever reaches a multiple of 3, however, she should say
"Fizz" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 5, she should say
"Buzz" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 15, she should
say "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.  A transcript of the first part of a game
is therefore:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16

Having a slightly more limited vocabulary, the version of FizzBuzz played by the
cows involves saying "Moo" instead of Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.  The beginning
of the cow version of the game is therefore

1, 2, Moo, 4, Moo, Moo, 7, 8, Moo, Moo, 11, Moo, 13, 14, Moo, 16

Given $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$), please determine the $N$th number spoken in
this game.

SCORING
Test cases 2-5 satisfy $N\le 10^6.$

INPUT FORMAT:
The input consists of a single integer, $N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please print out the $N$th number spoken during the game.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
7

The 4th number spoken is 7.  The first 4 numbers spoken are 1, 2, 4, 7, since we
skip over any time a cow says "Moo".

**Implementing Python Solution**

I'm working on a Python solution for a FizzBuzz variant. First, I'll restate the problem: I'm given a number \( N \) and need to find the \( N \)th positive int
eger that is not a multiple of 3 or 5.

Next, I have to conceptualize a solution without overcomplicating things. Writing pseudocode follows, leading to the actual code in a file named `solution.py`.
The challenge lies in efficiently computing this for values up to \( 1 \times 10^9 \), aiming for a constant time solution instead of simulating each number.
**Conceptualizing Counting Problem**

I'm tackling a counting problem to find the smallest \( X \) such that the count of numbers not divisible by 3 or 5 is at least \( N \). To calculate this, I de
termine how many numbers up to \( X \) are divisible by 3, 5, and both. I'll use a function \( f(X) \) to represent valid spoken numbers up to \( X \).

Since \( f(X) \) is non-decreasing, I can binary search between 1 and about \( 2N \) to find my answer. This method ensures that I accurately find the \( N \)th
 valid number without unnecessary calculations. I'll use efficient floor divisions in my implementation.
**Writing Pseudocode and Solution File**

Now I need to draft the pseudocode and prepare `solution.py`. The task involves restating the problem, conceptualizing a solution, and then outlining the pseudo
code. I can directly create these sections as per the user's instructions.

I'll make clear segments for the restatement, solution concept, and pseudocode. For the code, I’ll ensure it runs efficiently in pure Python without extra libra
ries.

Finally, I’ll inform the user that I'm about to create `solution.py` and implement the content in the file. Then, I'll call the appropriate function to finalize
 this.
**Drafting Pseudocode for Solution**

I think it’s better to present the pseudocode as a bullet list for clarity:

- Define `count_good(x)` to return `x - x//3 - x//5 + x//15`.
- Read the integer `N`.
- Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to `2 * N`.
- While `count_good(high)` is less than `N`, double `high`.
- Implement binary search: while `low` is less than `high`, find `mid`, and adjust `low` or `high` based on the results.
- Finally, print `low`.

I’ll finalize everything and prepare to create the solution file.

**Restatement**
- Find the Nᵗʰ positive integer that is not a multiple of 3 or 5 (cows say numbers except when they “Moo,” i.e. on multiples of 3 or 5).

**Solution Concept**
- Use a counting formula `f(x) = x - x//3 - x//5 + x//15` to compute how many valid numbers ≤ x.
- Binary search the smallest x such that `f(x) ≥ N`. That x is the answer.

**Pseudocode**
- Define `count_good(x)` returning `x - x//3 - x//5 + x//15`.
- Read integer `N`.
- Set `low = 1`, `high = 2 * N` (at least 2 to handle N=1).
- While `count_good(high) < N`, double `high`.
- While `low < high`:
  - Let `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
  - If `count_good(mid) ≥ N`, set `high = mid`.
  - Else set `low = mid + 1`.
- Print `low`.

Solution saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` providing N on stdin.
