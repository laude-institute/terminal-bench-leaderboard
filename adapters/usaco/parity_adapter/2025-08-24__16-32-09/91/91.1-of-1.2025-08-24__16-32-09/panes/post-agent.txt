Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Above the Median [Brian Dean]

Farmer John has lined up his N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows in a row to measure
their heights; cow i has height H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000,000,000)
nanometers--FJ believes in precise measurements! He wants to take a picture
of some contiguous subsequence of the cows to submit to a bovine
photography contest at the county fair.

The fair has a very strange rule about all submitted photos: a photograph
is only valid to submit if it depicts a group of cows whose median height
is at least a certain threshold X (1 <= X <= 1,000,000,000).

For purposes of this problem, we define the median of an array A[0...K] to
be A[ceiling(K/2)] after A is sorted, where ceiling(K/2) gives K/2 rounded
up to the nearest integer (or K/2 itself, it K/2 is an integer to begin
with). For example the median of {7, 3, 2, 6} is 6, and the median of {5,
4, 8} is 5.

Please help FJ count the number of different contiguous subsequences of his
cows that he could potentially submit to the photography contest.

PROBLEM NAME: median

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and X.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer H_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 6
10
5
6
2

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's four cows have heights 10, 5, 6, 2. We want to know how many
contiguous subsequences have median at least 6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of subsequences of FJ's cows that have median at
        least X. Note this may not fit into a 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 possible contiguous subsequences to consider. Of these, only 7
have median at least 6. They are {10}, {6}, {10, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 2}, {10,
5, 6}, {10, 5, 6, 2}.

1. **Problem Restatement**
   Given N cow heights and a threshold X, count how many contiguous subarrays have their median (with even-length taking the upper middle) at least X.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - Convert each height to +1 if ≥X, otherwise -1.
   - A subarray’s median ≥X iff the sum of its converted values is non-negative.
   - Count subarrays with non-negative sum by tracking prefix sums and, for each new prefix, counting how many earlier prefixes are ≤ it.
   - Use coordinate compression plus a Fenwick tree (BIT) for O(N log N) counting.

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   read N, X
   read array H of length N
   A <- [1 if h>=X else -1 for h in H]
   P[0] <- 0
   for i in 1..N:
     P[i] <- P[i-1] + A[i-1]
   compress all distinct values in P to ranks 1..M
   initialize BIT of size M with zeros
   ans <- 0
   update BIT at rank(P[0])
   for i in 1..N:
     r <- rank(P[i])
     ans += query BIT sum up to r
     update BIT at r
   print ans
   ```

4. **Solution File**
   The complete implementation is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
   ```
   python3 solution.py < input.txt
   ```
