[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Mirrors [Brian Dean and Travis Hance, 2013]

Farmer John's cows have been causing too much trouble around the farm, and
FJ therefore wants to keep a more watchful eye on them.  By installing N
reflective fences (1 <= N <= 200) at various locations on the farm, he
hopes to be able to see from his house at location (0,0) to the barn at
location (a,b).

On a 2D map of FJ's farm, fence i appears as a short line segment centered
at integer location (x_i, y_i) and tilted 45 degrees (either like '/' or
like '\').  For example, a fence oriented like '/' at position (3,5) could
be described as a line segment from (2.9,4.9) to (3.1,5.1).  Each fence
(and also the location of the barn) lies at a different position with
integer coordinates in the range -1,000,000...1,000,000.  No fence lies at
(0,0) or (a,b).

FJ plans to sit at his house at position (0,0) and look directly to the
right (in the +x direction).  With his gaze bouncing off some of the
reflective fences on his farm, he hopes to be able to see the point (a,b).
Unfortunately, FJ thinks he oriented one of his fences incorrectly (e.g.,
'\' instead of '/').  Please output the index of the first fence in FJ's
list such that by toggling its direction (between '/' and '\' or vice
versa), FJ will be able to see the point (a,b).

If FJ can already see the point (a,b) without toggling any fence, please
output 0.  If it is still impossible for him to see (a,b) even after
toggling up to a single fence, output -1.

PROBLEM NAME: mirrors

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers, N, a, and b.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 describes fence i and contains either "x_i
        y_i /" or "x_i y_i \", where (x_i, y_i) is the location of the
        center of the fence, and \ or / refers to its orientation.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 6 2
3 0 /
0 2 /
1 2 /
3 2 \
1 3 \

INPUT DETAILS:

A map of the farm looks like this (with H denoting FJ's house and B
denoting the barn):
3 .\.....
2 //.\..B
1 .......
0 H../...
  0123456

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The index of the first fence for which toggling that fence
        allows FJ to see the point (a,b).  If FJ can already see the
        point (a,b), please output 0, or if there is no way he can see
        (a,b) even after toggling up to one fence, please output -1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By toggling the fence at position (3,2), FJ can see the point (a,b).  On
the map:
3 .\.....
2 //./--B
1 ...|...
0 H--/...
  0123456

**Exploring reflection mechanics**

I'm working through the mirrors problem, focusing on ray tracing with reflections. I have N reflective segments, positioned at integer places, tilting either as
 "/" or "\". Each mirror behaves like an ideal mirror: the "/" mirror reflects rays from +x to +y and at angles that change both dx and dy accordingly. This ref
lection over the line y = -x results in swapping and inverting the directional components. The "\" mirror reflects differently, following its own unique rules.
It’s quite complex!
**Clarifying reflection rules**

I'm focused on defining the reflection rules for mirrors while working on an axis-aligned grid. Starting from FJ's position at (0,0) moving to the right, I need
 to check for intersections with fences, which only occur if the ray exactly hits the integer coordinates. Each fence occupies a small segment area, so precise
alignment matters. I’ve narrowed down the direction vectors and confirmed that reflections will lead to only axis-aligned paths. This setup will guide my simula
tion effectively!
**Designing loop detection and simulation**

I need to ensure loop detection to avoid infinite reflections. The idea is to run simulations with a maximum of N reflections. If a simulation is successful wit
hout toggling any fence, I’ll return 0. For each fence, I'll try toggling and simulate again, outputting the first successful toggle. The challenge is managing
N fences efficiently, especially with up to 200, so creating indexed structures for quick access seems necessary. I’ll restate the problem, conceptualize the so
lution, draft pseudocode, and then write the implementation in solution.py. Let's get started!

Here’s the complete Python solution in **solution.py**.

**Solution Overview**

- Restatement: Simulate a ray from (0,0) heading right, reflecting off 45° mirrors (‘/’ or ‘\\’) placed at integer points, and check if it reaches the barn at (
a,b). Find the first single mirror toggle (or none) that allows a clear line of sight.

- Approach:
  - Pre-index fences by their x- and y-coordinates for nearest-neighbor lookups.
  - Simulate the ray’s path, reflecting direction at each fence using simple direction swaps.
  - Check if the barn lies along the current ray segment before the next fence.
  - Try once with no toggles, then with each fence toggled in turn.

- Pseudocode:
  ```
  Read N, a, b
  Read fence positions (xi, yi) and orientation o_i
  Build:
    x_map[y] = sorted list of (x, idx)
    y_map[x] = sorted list of (y, idx)

  Define simulate(toggle_idx):
    x, y = 0, 0; dx, dy = 1, 0
    for steps up to 2N:
      compute barn_dist if barn lies ahead
      find nearest fence in (dx,dy) direction via bisect on x_map or y_map
      if barn_dist is valid and < fence_dist: return True
      if no fence: return False
      move to fence; determine effective orientation (toggled or not)
      reflect (dx,dy) accordingly; continue
    return False

  if simulate(-1): print(0)
  else for i in 0..N-1:
    if simulate(i): print(i+1); exit
  print(-1)
  ```

Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or walk through an example!
