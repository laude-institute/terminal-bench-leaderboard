[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But lo and behold, some entries of his log are
missing!

Farmer John is confident that the he started his log on the day of a breakout.
Please help him determine, out of all sequences of events consistent with the
log entries that remain, the minimum and maximum number of breakouts that may
have take place over the course of the logged time.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is
either $-1$, indicating that the log entry for day $i$ is missing, or a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the counter
was at
$a_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
If there is no sequence of events consistent with Farmer John's partial log and
his knowledge that the cows definitely broke out of the barn on the morning of
day $1$, output a single integer $-1$.  Otherwise, output two space-separated
integers $m$ followed by $M$, where $m$ is the minimum number of breakouts of
any consistent sequence of events, and $M$ is the maximum.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
-1 -1 -1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2 3

In this example, we can deduce that a breakout had to occur on day 3.  Knowing
that  a breakout also occurred on day 1, the only remaining bit of uncertainty
is whether a breakout occurred on day 2.  Hence, there were between 2 and 3
breakouts in total.

**Planning a Python solution**

The user is asking for a Python 3 solution to a problem, and the task involves a structured approach: first, I need to restate the problem, then conceptualize t
he solution, write pseudocode, and finally implement the code in a file named solution.py. I'll likely need to follow a multi-step plan and update the status of
 each step along the way. My steps will be to restate, conceptualize, write pseudocode, and implement the solution, updating as I progress.
**Creating a plan for implementation**

I can initiate a plan by calling for an update, starting with the restatement of the problem followed by updating its status as complete. Next, I'll conceptuali
ze the solution and mark that step as in progress, then proceed to pseudocode. The user might expect all steps together, but the guidelines suggest a structured
 plan for multi-step tasks.

I need to track the implementation process carefully, ensuring solution.py contains the final code to compute breakout sequences. Dynamic programming seems appr
opriate due to constraints, aiming for minimal and maximal breakout counts.
**Developing the dynamic programming approach**

For tracking the minimum and maximum possible breakouts each day, I'll set up two dynamic programming arrays, `dp_min` and `dp_max`. They will track breakouts a
s I iterate through each day. Day one will have specific conditions to initialize. My transitions will allow for either a breakout on a given day or no breakout
 while updating the age accordingly.

After filling these arrays, I can determine the min and max breakouts after processing all days, ensuring I’ll follow the guidelines and constraints—especially
avoiding outside libraries. Next, I’ll begin with the planning tool.

I’ve implemented the solution in **solution.py**, following the outlined approach:

- Restated that we track days since last breakout with missing entries.
- Conceived a DP over days and counter values to compute min/max breakouts.
- Wrote pseudocode mapping transitions for breakout vs. no breakout.
- Coded a Python solution avoiding external libraries.

Next steps: you can run `python3 solution.py < input.txt` to test. Let me know if you’d like any tests or further tweaks!
