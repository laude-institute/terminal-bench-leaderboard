[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Island Travels [Neal Wu, 2007]

Farmer John has taken the cows to a vacation out on the ocean! The cows are
living on N (1 <= N <= 15) islands, which are located on an R x C grid (1
<= R, C <= 50). An island is a maximal connected group of squares on the
grid that are marked as 'X', where two 'X's are connected if they share a
side. (Thus, two 'X's sharing a corner are not necessarily connected.)

Bessie, however, is arriving late, so she is coming in with FJ by
helicopter. Thus, she can first land on any of the islands she chooses. She
wants to visit all the cows at least once, so she will travel between
islands until she has visited all N of the islands at least once.

FJ's helicopter doesn't have much fuel left, so he doesn't want to use it
until the cows decide to go home. Fortunately, some of the squares in the
grid are shallow water, which is denoted by 'S'. Bessie can swim through
these squares in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) in
order to travel between the islands. She can also travel (in the four
cardinal directions) between an island and shallow water, and vice versa.

Find the minimum distance Bessie will have to swim in order to visit all of
the islands. (The distance Bessie will have to swim is the number of
distinct times she is on a square marked 'S'.) After looking at a map of
the area, Bessie knows this will be possible.

PROBLEM NAME: island

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C.

* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 contains C characters giving row i of the
        grid. Deep water squares are marked as '.', island squares are
        marked as 'X', and shallow water squares are marked as 'S'.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 4
XX.S
.S..
SXSS
S.SX
..SX

INPUT DETAILS:

There are three islands with shallow water paths connecting some of them.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the minimum distance Bessie
        has to swim to visit all islands.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can travel from the island in the top left to the one in the middle,
swimming 1 unit, and then travel from the middle island to the one in the
bottom right, swimming 2 units, for a total of 3 units.

**Exploring TSP and island distances**

I’m considering a strategy to find and label islands, then calculate distances between them to establish minimal shallow crossings. The goal is to solve the Tra
veling Salesman Problem (TSP) by using dynamic programming with a bitmask approach. I need to start by initializing the distance matrix through BFS, calculating
 costs based on how many squares were traversed. It seems that moving across certain squares will impact the cost differently, depending on the type of terrain.
**Planning BFS for distance calculation**

I’m setting up a BFS to calculate distances between islands by starting from multiple points on each island and checking for costs to reach any other island. Us
ing a 0-1 BFS, I’ll track costs based on the grid values. First, I’ll label the grid based on components, then use BFS from each component to build a distance m
atrix. Since there are only up to 15 islands, this approach seems feasible. I need to ensure I handle edge cases and update the distance grid correctly while av
oiding irrelevant cells. Time to get coding!
**Finalizing the TSP implementation**

After completing BFS, I'll update the distance matrix for each component to track the minimum distances. For distances between the same island, I think defaulti
ng to INF makes sense since we just want to avoid using them. I’ll initialize the DP array and set starting points based on the islands. As I loop through masks
, I'll compute the new combinations and keep track of the minimum costs along the way. Time to implement this and create the solution file!

1. Problem Restatement
Bessie must swim across shallow water (‘S’) to visit all separate islands (‘X’) on an R×C grid. Each island is a connected region of X’s. Swimming cost is the c
ount of S squares traversed. Starting on any island, find the minimal total swim distance to visit every island at least once.

2. Solution Concept
- Flood-fill label each island (component IDs 0..N−1).
- For each island i, perform a 0–1 BFS (moving on X costs 0, on S costs 1) from all its cells to compute minimal swim cost to every grid cell. Extract minimal c
osts to each other island j, yielding an N×N distance matrix.
- Solve a bitmask DP TSP: dp[mask][i] = min swim cost to visit islands in mask and end at i. Initialize dp[1<<i][i]=0. Transition by adding one island at a time
. Answer is min over dp[(1<<N)−1][i].

3. Pseudocode
- Read R, C, grid
- comp = flood_fill_islands(grid) → N islands
- Initialize dist[N][N] = INF
- For each island i:
  • Run 0–1 BFS from all cells with comp==i
  • For each cell of island j≠i, update dist[i][j] = min dist via BFS
- DP over subsets of islands:
  • dp[mask][i] = INF; dp[1<<i][i] = 0
  • For mask in [0..2^N): for i in mask: for j not in mask:
      dp[mask|1<<j][j] = min(dp[mask][i] + dist[i][j])
- Print min(dp[(1<<N)−1][i])

4. Solution File
The complete implementation is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with standard input redirected from your test file.
