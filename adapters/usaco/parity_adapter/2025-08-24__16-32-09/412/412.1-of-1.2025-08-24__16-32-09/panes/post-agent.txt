[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Reordering the Cows [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100), conveniently numbered 1..N, are
standing in a row.  Their ordering is described by an array A, where A(i)
is the number of the cow in position i.  Farmer John wants to rearrange
them into a different ordering for a group photo, described by an array B,
where B(i) is the number of the cow that should end up in position i.

For example, suppose the cows start out ordered as follows:

A = 5 1 4 2 3

and suppose Farmer John would like them instead to be ordered like this:

B = 2 5 3 1 4

To re-arrange themselves from the "A" ordering to the "B" ordering, the
cows perform a number of "cyclic" shifts.  Each of these cyclic shifts
begins with a cow moving to her proper location in the "B" ordering,
displacing another cow, who then moves to her proper location, displacing
another cow, and so on, until eventually a cow ends up in the position
initially occupied by the first cow on the cycle.  For example, in the
ordering above, if we start a cycle with cow 5, then cow 5 would move to
position 2, displacing cow 1, who moves to position 4, displacing cow 2,
who moves to position 1, ending the cycle.  The cows keep performing cyclic
shifts until every cow eventually ends up in her proper location in the "B"
ordering.  Observe that each cow participates in exactly one cyclic shift,
unless she occupies the same position in the "A" and "B" orderings.

Please compute the number of different cyclic shifts, as well as the length
of the longest cyclic shift, as the cows rearrange themselves.

PROBLEM NAME: reorder

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integer A(i).

* Lines 2+N..1+2N: Line 1+N+i contains the integer B(i).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5
5
1
4
2
3
2
5
3
1
4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, the first giving the number of
        cyclic shifts and the second giving the number cows involved
        in the longest such shift.  If there are no cyclic shifts,
        output -1 for the second number.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2 3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are two cyclic shifts, one involving cows 5, 1, and 2, and the other
involving cows 3 and 4.

**Mapping cow positions**

I need to determine the mapping of cows from their current positions to their desired positions. I'll create an array where each index corresponds to positions
and holds the index of the cow currently in that position. This way, I can track which cow needs to move where. Essentially, I want to define a permutation that
 reveals the current cow in relation to its target location. The focus is on mapping each cow to the one occupying its desired position.
**Computing cow positions**

I need to determine where each cow currently is in array A and where it wants to be in array B. This means creating maps for both positions and iterating throug
h them. If cow x wants to move to its desired position in B but cow y is already there, then x will displace y. I'll track this displacement with a mapping call
ed nextCow.

Next, I’ll identify cycles in these movements, counting those with lengths greater than one. If no cycles exist, I should return zero for the count and -1 for t
he second output. Let's clarify how these cycles operate!
**Constructing cow mappings**

I’m creating a dictionary for nextCow, which will hold the cows’ movements based on their desired positions. I’ll keep track of which cows I've visited, countin
g cycles and the maximum length of those cycles.

If a cow hasn’t been visited, I’ll traverse its movements, marking visited cows and counting the lengths. At the end, I’ll output the cycle count and the maximu
m length found. I’m also considering edge cases, like when there's only one cow. Now, I’ll write out the plan clearly before coding!

1. Restatement
- We have N cows in initial order A and want to reach target order B.
- Cows move via cyclic shifts: each cow moves to its target spot, displacing another, forming cycles.
- Compute how many cycles (length >1) occur and the longest cycle length (or -1 if none).

2. Conceptual Solution
- Map each cow x to the cow currently in x’s target position.
- This defines a permutation; its cycles correspond to the shifts.
- Count cycles of size >1 and track the maximum size.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read array A[1..N]
read array B[1..N]
build pos_in_B[cow] = position of cow in B
for x in 1..N:
    next_cow[x] = A[pos_in_B[x]]
visited = [False]* (N+1)
num_cycles = 0
max_len = 0
for x in 1..N:
    if not visited[x]:
        traverse cycle from x, marking visited, count length
        if length >1:
            num_cycles +=1
            max_len = max(max_len, length)
if num_cycles == 0: max_len = -1
print(num_cycles, max_len)
```

4. Implementation
The solution is saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
