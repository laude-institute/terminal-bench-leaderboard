Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A little known fact about cows is that they have their own version of the
alphabet, the "cowphabet".  It consists of the 26 letters 'a' through 'z', but
when a cow speaks the cowphabet, she lists these letters in a specific ordering
that might be different from the order 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' we are used to
hearing.

To pass the time, Bessie the cow has been humming the cowphabet over and  over
again, and Farmer John is curious how many times she's hummed it.

Given a lowercase string of letters that Farmer John has heard Bessie say,
compute the minimum number of times Bessie must have hummed the entire cowphabet
in order for Farmer John to have heard the given string. Farmer John isn't
always paying attention to what Bessie hums, and so he might have missed some of
the letters that Bessie has hummed.  The string you are told consists of just
the letters that he remembers hearing.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the 26 lowercase letters 'a' through 'z' in the
order they appear in the cowphabet.  The next line contains the string  of
lowercase letters that Farmer John heard Bessie say.  This string has length at
least $1$ and at most $1000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Print the minimum number of times Bessie must have hummed the entire cowphabet.

SAMPLE INPUT:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
mood
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, the cowphabet is ordered the same as the normal alphabet.

Bessie must have hummed the cowphabet at least three times. It is possible for
Bessie to have only hummed the cowphabet three times, and for Farmer John to
have heard the letters in uppercase as denoted below.


abcdefghijklMnOpqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnOpqrstuvwxyz
abcDefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

SCORING:
In test cases 2-5, the cowphabet is the same as the normal alphabet.Test cases 6-10 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Planning coding solution**

The user wants me to outline a four-step process: restate in plain English, conceptualize the solution, write pseudocode, and save everything as solution.py. I'
ll need to make sure to actually create that file and put the code there, skipping tests for now.

The logic involves reading a string and counting how many times I loop back to the start based on a custom alphabet. I'll define the current position and handle
 the first character separately to avoid off-by-one errors. The final count will be stored as "times."
**Preparing to generate solution.py**

I need to implement a solution based on the cowphabet concept, with a maximum heard string length of 1000. The plan involves reading two lines: the cowphabet an
d the string to analyze. I'll build a dictionary to map each letter to its position, then count the occurrences as described.

I'll prepare the solution with clear steps: restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, write the pseudocode, and finally, create the solution.py file thro
ugh the necessary process. This approach will maintain clarity and ensure no external libraries are used.
**Conceptualizing minimum passes**

I'm working on counting the minimum passes based on a heard string of letters that Bessie hums. The plan is to map each letter to its index in the cowphabet. As
 I iterate through the heard string, each time the next letter's index is less than or equal to the previous one, it indicates a new pass.

I'll create pseudocode to outline the steps and then proceed to save everything in solution.py as instructed. The implementation will follow a clear structure,
ensuring accuracy in counting the passes.

Here’s the implementation saved as `solution.py`.

**Restatement**
- Given a custom ordering of the 26 lowercase letters (“cowphabet”) and a sequence of heard letters (possibly skipping some), determine the minimum number of fu
ll cowphabet passes needed to produce the heard sequence in order.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Build a mapping from each letter to its position in the cowphabet.
- Traverse the heard string, tracking the previous letter’s index.
- Whenever the current letter’s index is less than or equal to the previous, that indicates a new pass, so increment the pass count.
- Print the total passes.

**Pseudocode**
```
read cowphabet
read heard_string
map each letter in cowphabet to its index
passes = 1
prev_index = -1
for each letter in heard_string:
    current_index = map[letter]
    if current_index <= prev_index:
        passes += 1
    prev_index = current_index
print passes
```

Your solution is in `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
