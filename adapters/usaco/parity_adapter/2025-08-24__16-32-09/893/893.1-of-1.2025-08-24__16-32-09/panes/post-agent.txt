[BEGIN PROBLEM]
When bored of playing their usual shell game, Bessie the cow and her friend
Elsie like to play another common game called "guess the animal".

Initially, Bessie thinks of some animal (most of the time, this animal is a cow,
making the game rather boring, but occasionally Bessie is  creative and thinks
of something else).  Then Elsie proceeds to ask a series of questions to figure
out what animal Bessie has selected.  Each question asks whether the animal has
some specific characteristic, and Bessie answers each question with "yes" or
"no". For example:


Elsie: "Does the animal fly?"
Bessie: "No"
Elsie: "Does the animal eat grass?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal make milk?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal go moo?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "In that case I think the animal is a cow."
Bessie: "Correct!"

If we call the "feasible set" the set of all animals with characteristics
consistent with Elsie's questions so far, then Elsie keeps asking questions
until the feasible set contains only one animal, after which she announces this
animal as her answer.  In each question, Elsie picks a characteristic of some
animal in the feasible set to ask about (even if this characteristic might not
help her narrow down the feasible set any further).  She never asks about the
same  characteristic twice.

Given all of the animals that Bessie and Elsie know as well as their
characteristics, please determine the maximum number of "yes" answers  Elsie
could possibly receive before she knows the right animal.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains the number of animals, $N$
($2 \leq N \leq 100$).   Each of the next $N$ lines describes an animal.  The
line starts with the animal name,  then an integer $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 100$),
then $K$ characteristics of that animal. Animal names and characteristics are
strings of up to 20 lowercase characters (a..z).  No two animals have  exactly
the same characteristics.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the maximum number of "yes" answers Elsie could receive before the
game ends.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
bird 2 flies eatsworms
cow 4 eatsgrass isawesome makesmilk goesmoo
sheep 1 eatsgrass
goat 2 makesmilk eatsgrass
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, it is possible for Elsie to generate a transcript with  3 "yes"
answers (the one above), and it is not possible to generate a transcript with
more than 3 "yes" answers.

[2025-08-24T21:42:04] thinking

**Considering animal characteristics**

I'm tackling a problem where Elsie is trying to identify an animal based on shared characteristics. She asks questions to maximize the number of "yes" answers u
ntil only one animal remains. The goal is to figure out the best order of questions to get the most "yes" answers. If two animals share many characteristics, as
king all those questions first should yield several "yes" answers before distinguishing them. I wonder how this logic applies when considering more than two ani
mals. Let's explore!
**Exploring characteristic overlap**

I'm diving into the characteristic overlap between the target animal and others. If Bessie's animal is A, I need to determine the common characteristics with an
y animal B, represented as C(A,B). When Elsie asks about these common traits, each "yes" response accumulates, but she can only distinguish A from others after
identifying a unique characteristic.

In a case like cow and goat, they share two traits, but the cow has an additional unique trait that leads to an extra "yes." This means the total "yes" answers
equal the shared traits plus one for the unique distinction. So, generalizing: with C common traits between animals A and B, Elsie can ask those and then an add
itional question to identify A.
**Clarifying tool call sequence**

I'm thinking through the order of tool calls for applying a patch and finalizing the output. Generally, the structure seems to indicate that I apply the patch f
irst, then finalize the message. However, the instructions suggest that tool calls should go to commentary first, and there's no strict ordering needed.

For my final message, I need to provide a restatement, conceptual overview, and pseudocode, plus mention saving the solution as a file. I’ll go with commentary
first for the patch, then include everything in the final message. Let's finalize the code for `solution.py` and make sure it handles input effectively!

1. Restatement
Bessie thinks of an animal from a list, each described by a set of characteristics. Elsie asks yes/no questions about characteristics (never repeats one), and s
tops when she’s narrowed down to exactly one animal. We want the maximum number of “yes” answers she could get before identifying the animal, assuming she asks
optimally and Bessie’s choice is adversarial.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Any two different animals share some common characteristics C. If Elsie’s target is one animal A, she can ask those C shared traits (all “yes”) without elimin
ating its competitor B.
- To distinguish A from B, she then asks one characteristic unique to A, yielding another “yes” before B is eliminated.
- The worst-case (max “yes”) occurs for the pair with the largest intersection. Answer = max common characteristics between any two animals + 1.

3. Pseudocode
- Read integer N.
- For each of N lines: read name, k, then k characteristics; store each animal’s characteristic set.
- Initialize `max_common = 0`.
- For every pair of animals (i,j):
    - Compute `common = size of intersection(chars[i], chars[j])`.
    - If `common > max_common`, update it.
- Print `max_common + 1`.

The solution code is saved in `solution.py`.
