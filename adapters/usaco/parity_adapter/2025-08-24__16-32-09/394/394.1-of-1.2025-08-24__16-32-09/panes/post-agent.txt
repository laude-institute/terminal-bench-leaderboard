[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Mirror Field [Mark Gordon]

Farmer John has left some old mirrors sitting outside his house, and his
cows, feeling mischievous as always, have stolen them!

The cows have set up the mirrors in a rectangular field measuring N by M
squares (1 <= N, M <= 1,000).  In each square, they have placed a double
sided mirror between two of its opposite corners.  These two possible
configurations are represented by the '/' character (a mirror connecting
the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner) and the '\' character (a
mirror connecting the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner).

One evening, Bessie the cow brings a laser pointer out to the mirror field.
Standing outside the field, she shines the beam of light either
horizontally or vertically along either a row or column of the field,
causing it to bounce of some number of mirrors.  Since the mirrors are all
diagonally oriented, a horizontal beam of light that reflects off a mirror
will end up traveling vertically, and vice versa.  Bessie wonders what is
the maximum number of mirrors on which her beam of light can be reflected
at the same time.  Given the layout of the mirror field, please help Bessie
compute this number.

PROBLEM NAME: mirror

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integers N and M, separated by a space.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line will contain M '/' or '\' characters,
        describing a row of the mirror field.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 3
/\\
\\\
/\/

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum number of times a
        horizontal or vertical beam originating outside the mirror
        field could be reflected.  Please output -1 if it could be
        reflected indefinitely.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can shine the beam downwards above the middle column of her
field to have it reflected 3 times.

**Analyzing beam reflections**

I'm looking at a problem involving an N x M grid filled with mirrors that reflect a beam. The beam can enter from any side and will reflect off the mirrors, cha
nging direction until it exits. I need to figure out how to compute the maximum number of reflections before it leaves the grid, and if it's infinite, I should
return -1. I'll implement a solution in Python without using any external libraries. The constraints specify N and M can go up to 1000, resulting in potential p
ositions to explore.
**Simulating beam paths**

I need to simulate the beam entering the grid and focus on the maximum possible reflections before it exits. The challenge is that if there’s a cycle, it leads
to infinite reflections. The total simulation process could take too long, hitting up to 4 billion steps, which is impractical. To improve efficiency, I can cre
ate a graph of states defined by position and direction, and use memoization for cycle detection. Since I can travel in four directions and have 4 million state
s, I’ll utilize dynamic programming to compute reflections efficiently from each state until exit or infinity.
**Implementing DFS with memoization**

I'm considering using a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to compute the length of reflections in the beam simulation. Each state corresponds to a node
in a directed graph, and I want to track transitions accurately. I can start from each entry point, defining states based on the beam's position and direction.
The challenge of memory utilization arises, as the worst-case scenario could yield around 4 million states. However, I can optimize by only storing states reach
ed from the starting entries, which should keep memory usage more manageable while detecting cycles and infinite reflections efficiently.

1. Problem Restatement
Bessie shines a horizontal or vertical laser into an N×M grid of diagonally-oriented mirrors (‘/’ and ‘\\’). The beam reflects between horizontal and vertical,
and exits when it leaves the grid. We need the maximum number of mirror reflections before exiting (or -1 if it cycles forever).

2. Solution Concept
We model each beam path starting from an entry point. We simulate step by step, tracking the state (cell and direction). We memoize results per state to avoid r
ecomputation. During a run, if we revisit a state, there’s an infinite cycle. Otherwise, when exiting or hitting a known state, we backfill counts for all visit
ed states. We repeat for all 2N+2M entry points, returning -1 on any infinite, or the maximum reflection count.

3. Pseudocode
- Read N, M and the grid.
- Define direction vectors `dr, dc` and reflection maps for ‘/’ and ‘\\’.
- memo = empty map from (i,j,d) → count or None for infinite.
- simulate(start_i, start_j, start_d):
  - Initialize (i,j,d), visited_map, step=0.
  - Loop:
    - Move to (ni,nj) = (i+dr[d], j+dc[d]).
    - If out of bounds: total=step; infinite=False; break.
    - state=(ni,nj,d). If in memo: use memo to set total/infinite; break.
    - If in visited_map: infinite=True; total=None; break.
    - Mark visited_map[state]=step.
    - Reflect d according to grid[ni][nj]; step+=1; update i,j.
  - For each visited state, set memo[state] = None if infinite else total - visited_map[state].
  - Return total (None for infinite).
- best=0
- For each row r: simulate from left (d=1) and right (d=3).
  - If any returns None: print(-1) and exit; else update best.
- For each column c: simulate from top (d=2) and bottom (d=0).
  - Same infinite check; update best.
- Print(best)

4. Solution File
The implementation is saved in `solution.py`.
