[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Tied Down [Brian Dean, 2012]

As we all know, Bessie the cow likes nothing more than causing mischief on
the farm.  To keep her from causing too much trouble, Farmer John decides
to tie Bessie down to a fence with a long rope.  When viewed from above,
the fence consists of N posts (1 <= N <= 10) that are arranged along
vertical line, with Bessie's position (bx, by) located to the right of this
vertical line.  The rope FJ uses to tie down Bessie is described by a
sequence of M line segments (3 <= M <= 10,000), where the first segment
starts at Bessie's position and the last ends at Bessie's position. No
fence post lies on any of these line segments.  However, line segments may
cross, and multiple line segments may overlap at their endpoints.

Here is an example of the scene, viewed from above:



To help Bessie escape, the rest of the cows have stolen a saw from the
barn.  Please determine the minimum number of fence posts they must cut
through and remove in order for Bessie to be able to pull free (meaning she
can run away to the right without the rope catching on any of the fence posts).

All (x,y) coordinates in the input (fence posts, Bessie, and line segment
endpoints) lie in the range 0..10,000.  All fence posts have the same x
coordinate, and bx is larger than this value.

PROBLEM NAME: tied

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: N, M, bx, by.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated x and y
        coordinates of fence post i.

* Lines 2+N..2+N+M: Each of these M+1 lines contains, in sequence, the
        space-separated x and y coordinates of a point along the rope.
        The first and last points are always the same as Bessie's
        location (bx, by).

There are two posts at (2,3) and (2,1).  Bessie is at (6,1).  The rope goes
from (6,1) to (2,4) to (1,1), and so on, ending finally at (6,1). The shape
of the rope is the same as in the figure above.

**Evaluating rope segments and posts**

I’m working through a problem: We have N posts and M rope segments forming a closed shape around these posts. The goal is to figure out the minimal number of posts to remove so Bessie can move infinitely to the right without crossing any rope segments. The posts are positioned at the same x-coordinate, while Bessie’s position is to their east. The rope forms a closed loop around the posts, and I need to determine how to cut enough posts to allow free movement.
**Examining rope interactions with posts**

I'm thinking about how the rope interacts with each post. When the rope loops around a post, the post effectively encloses the rope. The rope zigzags around the posts, and I need to count how many times it crosses a vertical line going right to determine if Bessie is trapped. It’s established that if the count is odd, the post is within the enclosed loop. This means the posts inside the rope’s polygon could block Bessie’s path, so I need to identify and potentially remove those posts.
**Analyzing rope and post interactions**

I'm exploring how rope interacts with posts. The sample suggests that removing either post allows Bessie to escape, indicating that the rope loops around both. It seems that cutting one post would free the rope because it can no longer loop around that post. I need to represent the rope as a graph where each post is a vertex. Bessie needs a clear path to the right without crossing rope segments, and removing posts ensures that the rope isn’t anchored at those points, allowing her to escape to infinity.
**Assessing rope entanglement with posts**

I’m analyzing how posts impact Bessie’s escape path. If a post lies in a region where the rope has an odd number of loops, it must be cut to let the rope pass. The rope crosses the fence at various points, and I need to count these crossings to determine whether a region is inside or outside. Bessie is on the right side, trying to escape. If she needs to avoid posts, I must identify and cut those that trap the rope, allowing for a clear path to the right without entanglements.
**Planning a covering points solution**

I’m working on a classic problem of covering all intervals with the minimal number of points. Given that there are only a few points, I can use a brute-force approach or a dynamic solution. However, a greedy method might not be optimal. I can explore all subsets of posts since N is small, allowing me to check each interval for coverage. I'll read the necessary inputs, calculate the crossing points, and gather the loops. Then, I’ll check each subset for validity against these loops to find the minimum size needed. Now, it’s time to implement the solution!

1. Problem restatement  
- We have N fence posts all on a vertical line and a closed polyline (“rope”) that starts/ends at Bessie’s point to the right of the fence.  
- Each time the rope winds from right to left of the fence and back, it forms a “loop” around some vertical span.  
- Any post whose y-coordinate lies within a loop traps the rope on that loop. Cutting one post per loop frees that loop.  
- Find the minimum number of posts to cut so that every loop has at least one cut and the rope can be pulled free.

2. Solution idea  
- Scan the rope segments in order, detecting each crossing from right→left (entry) and left→right (exit) of the fence at x = fence_x.  
- Record each loop’s y-interval [entry_y, exit_y].  
- This gives a list of intervals (loops) on the y-axis.  
- We need a hitting set of post y’s that intersects every loop interval.  
- Since N ≤ 10, we can brute-force subsets of posts by increasing size and pick the first subset whose y’s intersect every interval.

3. Pseudocode  
- Read N, M, Bessie pos, post positions, rope points.  
- fence_x ← posts[0].x  
- loops ← empty list, entry_y ← None  
- For each segment (p[i]→p[i+1]):  
    • If it crosses right→left of fence: compute y_cross, set entry_y  
    • Else if it crosses left→right and entry_y exists: compute y_cross exit, append (min(entry_y,exit_y), max(...)) to loops, reset entry_y  
- If loops empty: output 0  
- post_ys ← list of post y’s  
- For k = 1..N:  
    for each k-combination of posts:  
        if for every loop interval, at least one post_y in combo lies within it:  
            print(k) and exit  
- Print N (fallback)
