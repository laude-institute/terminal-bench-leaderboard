[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Empty Stalls [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's new barn consists of a huge circle of N stalls (2 <= N <=
3,000,000), numbered 0..N-1, with stall N-1 being adjacent to stall 0.

At the end of each day, FJ's cows arrive back at the barn one by one, each
with a preferred stall they would like to occupy.  However, if a cow's
preferred stall is already occupied by another cow, she scans forward
sequentially from this stall until she finds the first unoccupied stall,
which she then claims.  If she scans past stall N-1, she continues scanning
from stall 0.

Given the preferred stall of each cow, please determine the smallest index
of a stall that remains unoccupied after all the cows have returned to the
barn.  Notice that the answer to this question does not depend on the order
in which the cows return to the barn.

In order to avoid issues with reading huge amounts of input, the input to
this problem is specified in a concise format using K lines (1 <= K <=
10,000) each of the form:

X Y A B

One of these lines specifies the preferred stall for XY total cows: X cows
prefer each of the stalls f(1) .. f(Y), where f(i) = (Ai + B) mod N.  The
values of A and B lie in the range 0...1,000,000,000.

Do not forget the standard memory limit of 64MB for all problems.

PROBLEM NAME: empty

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line contains integers X Y A B, interpreted as
        above.  The total number of cows specified by all these lines
        will be at most N-1.  Cows can be added to the same stall by
        several of these lines.

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 3
3 2 2 4
2 1 0 1
1 1 1 7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 stalls in the barn, numbered 0..9.  The second line of input
states that 3 cows prefer stall (2*1+4) mod 10 = 6, and 3 cows prefer stall
(2*2+4) mod 10 = 8.  The third line states that 2 cows prefer stall (0*1+1)
mod 10 = 1.  Line four specifies that 1 cow prefers stall (1*1+7) mod 10 =
8 (so a total of 4 cows prefer this stall).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum index of an unoccupied stall.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

All stalls will end up occupied except stall 5.

[2025-08-24T22:28:04] thinking

**Optimizing find operation**

I’m thinking about optimizing the find operation, considering an iterative approach with a while loop and local variables. I should define a parent list, but I
need to keep memory usage in check. Accessing an array should be valid and efficient, but I have to consider time complexity, which might lead to up to 3 millio
n operations. While Python's C array access may be faster than lists, I need to ensure memory constraints are met. My next steps include restating the problem i
n plain English, developing a conceptual solution, and writing out pseudocode.
**Creating solution.py**

I’m going to save the code as `solution.py`. Since this environment doesn’t require tests or a detailed plan for a simple multi-step answer, I can proceed direc
tly. The final answer will include several sections: first, a restatement of the problem, then a conceptual solution, and afterwards pseudocode.

I’ll ensure to note that the code will be saved as `solution.py` and include that code. I need to create this file and use the right approach to ensure I follow
 formatting guidelines correctly. I’ll present everything clearly and concisely.
**Drafting solution.py**

I’m getting ready to draft the code for `solution.py`. It starts with importing the necessary modules and defining the main function. Inside the function, I'll
read the input, define the required variables, and create the parent array efficiently using the `array` module.

For the find function, I’ll implement path compression and then write out the loops to handle the cows' preferences. I'll ensure to inline the union operation f
or clarity and efficiency. Lastly, I’ll check that the overall memory usage is reasonable and proceed to finalize the code in `solution.py`.

I’ve implemented a DSU-based approach in `solution.py` that tracks the next free stall using an integer array. Each preferred stall assignment scans to the next
 available spot via path-compressed finds, handling the circular wrap. Let me know if you’d like test cases or further refinements!
