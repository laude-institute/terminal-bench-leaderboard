Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Overplanting (Silver) [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John has purchased a new machine that is capable of planting grass
within any rectangular region of his farm that is "axially aligned" (i.e.,
with vertical and horizontal sides).  Unfortunately, the machine
malfunctions one day and plants grass in not one, but N (1 <= N <= 1000)
different rectangular regions, some of which may even overlap.

Given the rectangular regions planted with grass, please help FJ compute
the total area in his farm that is now covered with grass.

PROBLEM NAME: planting

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains four space-separated integers x1 y1
        x2 y2 specifying a rectangular region with upper-left corner
        (x1,y1) and lower-right corner (x2,y2).  All coordinates are
        in the range -10^8...10^8.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
0 5 4 1
2 4 6 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total area covered by grass.  Note that this could be
        too large to fit into a 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

20

Problem Restatement
Farmer John’s machine planted grass over N axis-aligned rectangles (which may overlap). We need the total area covered by grass.

Solution Concept
- Sweep a vertical line from left to right at each rectangle edge.
- At each x-coordinate, update an active list of y-intervals (add or remove intervals).
- Between events, compute the union length of active y-intervals, multiply by Δx, and accumulate area.
- To compute union length, sort intervals and merge overlaps in linear time.

Pseudocode
```
read n
events = []
for each rectangle:
    normalize y_low, y_high from y1, y2
    add event (x1, +1, y_low, y_high)
    add event (x2, -1, y_low, y_high)
sort events by x
area = 0
active = []
i = 0
while i < len(events):
    x = events[i].x
    process all events at x:
        if type == +1: active.append(interval)
        else: remove one matching interval
    if no further events: break
    covered_y = merge_and_sum(active)
    dx = next_event_x - x
    area += covered_y * dx
output area
```

I’ve saved the full implementation in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or make adjustments!
