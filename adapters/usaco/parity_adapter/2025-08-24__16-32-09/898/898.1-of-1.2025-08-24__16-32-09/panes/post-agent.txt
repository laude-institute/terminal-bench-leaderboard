[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

Today the cows are a bit sleepy, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive. The $k$ cows whom she passes
will amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after
them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find a sequence of instructions that sorts the
cows in the minimum number of time steps.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers:
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, indicating the starting order of the cows.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line should contain a single integer, $K$, giving the minimum number of time
steps required to sort the cows.

The second line should contain $K$ space-separated integers,
$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K$, each in the range $1 \ldots N-1$.
Furthermore, if in the $i$-th time step FJ
instructs the cow facing him to move $c_i$ paces down the line, then after $K$
time steps the cows should be in sorted order.

If there are multiple optimal instruction sequences, your program may output any
of them.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2 4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
2 2 3

[2025-08-24T22:12:14] thinking

**Understanding cow sorting**

I'm considering a problem involving N cows and their initial permutation. Only the first cow is active at the start. Each move consists of taking this cow and p
lacing it k positions down the line. This shifting continues until the cows are sorted in order. Essentially, I'm looking for the minimum number of moves requir
ed to achieve this. There's a key observation about the longest increasing suffix that's crucial for finding an efficient sorting approach.
**Analyzing cow sorting operations**

I'm looking at operations that essentially rotate the prefix of cows but always remove the first element. To sort the cows into sequence 1 to N, I want to ident
ify the longest increasing suffix at the end. By scanning from the back, I find the length of the sorted tail, counting how many elements match the expected inc
reasing order.

Let's define this count. It gives the minimal operations needed to sort, which is N minus this count, as we can keep sorted elements in place. This relates to t
he Sleepy Cow Sorting problem. I'll have to compute how many elements among the suffix are less than each of the first few cows to finalize the moves needed.
**Deriving cow sorting logic**

I'm examining the steps involved in processing the cows while trying to maintain their order. At each step, I have to figure out how many cows are less than the
 current cow I'm moving. When counting the remaining cows, I recognize I need to consider both the suffix and the unmoved prefix cows.

Interestingly, for each cow, I can derive the necessary position based on how many smaller cows there are among them. I also want to align this with the known f
ormula for minimizing moves in the Sleepy Cow Sorting problem. The goal is to clarify that I shouldn’t have operations where I have k equal to zero since that i
ndicates no movement is needed, which isn’t allowed.
**Exploring cow movement operations**

I'm working through the Sleepy Cow problem by calculating how to sort cows efficiently. The key is determining how many cows are in the suffix that are less tha
n the current cow in front. For each cow, I want to compute its optimal position in the sorted order after moving.

When it comes to the operations, there’s scrutiny on how many moves to make and ensuring that k stays above one, which can't be zero. If we visualize the proces
s, I recognize that sorted suffixes remain unchanged during movements, so my focus is on the appropriate insertion of cows in this context while maintaining the
ir order. This leads to deciding how many cows I can leave unmoved if they are already in the correct order.

1. Problem Restatement
- We have a line of N cows in some initial order and can only move the front cow back k positions each step.
- We need the minimum steps to sort the cows in ascending order.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Identify the longest suffix that is already strictly increasing; those cows stay in place.
- The remaining prefix of size K = N − (suffix length) must each be moved once.
- Maintain a Fenwick tree of the “tail” cows (initial suffix + those moved so far) to track their values.
- For each cow x in the prefix (in order), determine how many tail cows have value < x (call this pos). To insert x into its final position among the tail, move
 it past (remaining prefix cows) + pos positions, i.e. k = pos + (K − current_index − 1).
- Add x into the Fenwick tree and repeat.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N and array p[0..N-1]
compute r = length of suffix where p[i] < p[i+1]
K = N - r
initialize Fenwick tree of size N
for each x in the suffix p[N-r..N-1]:
    Fenwick.add(x,1)
moves = []
for idx in 0..K-1:
    x = p[idx]
    less = Fenwick.sum(x-1)
    rem = K - (idx + 1)
    moves.append(less + rem)
    Fenwick.add(x,1)
print K
print moves (space-separated)
```
