[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow was excited to recently return to in-person learning!
Unfortunately, her instructor, Farmer John, is a very boring lecturer, and so
she ends up falling asleep in class often.

Farmer John has noticed that Bessie has not been paying attention in class. He
has asked another student in class, Elsie, to keep track of the number of times
Bessie falls asleep in a given class. There are $N$ class periods
($1\le N\le 10^5$), and Elsie logs that Bessie fell asleep $a_i$ times
($0\le a_i\le 10^6$) in the $i$-th class period. The total number of times Bessie fell
asleep across all class periods is at most $10^6$.

Elsie, feeling very competitive with Bessie, wants to make Farmer John feel like
Bessie is consistently falling asleep the same number of times in every class --
making it appear that the issue is entirely Bessie's fault, with no dependence
on Farmer John's sometimes-boring lectures. The only way Elsie may modify the
log is by combining two adjacent class periods.  For example, if
$a=[1,2,3,4,5],$ then if Elsie combines the second and third class periods the
log will become $[1,5,4,5]$.

Help Elsie compute the minimum number of modifications to the log that she needs
to make so that she can make all the numbers in the log equal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
Each input will contain $T$ ($1\le T\le 10$) test cases that should be solved
independently.

The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases to be solved. The $T$ test
cases follow, each described by a pair of lines. The first line of each pair
contains $N$, and the second contains $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$.

It is guaranteed that within each test case, the sum of all values in $a$ is at
most $10^6$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases is at
most
$10^5$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Please write $T$ lines of output, giving the minimum number of modifications
Elsie could perform to make all the log entries equal for each case.


SAMPLE INPUT:
3
6
1 2 3 1 1 1
3
2 2 3
5
0 0 0 0 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
2
0

For the first test case in this example, Elsie can change her log to consist
solely of 3s with 3 modifications.


   1 2 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 2 1
-> 3 3 3

For the second test case, Elsie can change her log to 7 with 2 modifications.


   2 2 3
-> 2 5
-> 7

For the last test case, Elsie doesn’t need to perform any operations; the log
already consists of equal entries.

1. **Problem Restatement**
Given a list of nonnegative integers representing how many times Bessie fell asleep each class, you may merge any two adjacent entries (summing them) at one ope
ration. You want all final entries equal with the fewest merges.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
- The total sum \(S\) of the list never changes. If you end with \(K\) equal segments, each segment must sum to \(V = S/K\).
- Merging reduces the list length by 1, so the number of operations is \(N - K\). To minimize operations, maximize \(K\).
- For each divisor \(v\) of \(S\) (as a candidate segment sum \(V\)), check if you can greedily scan and form consecutive segments summing to \(v\). Skip any \(
v\) smaller than the largest single entry.
- The first valid (smallest) \(v\) yields the largest \(K = S/v\) and thus the minimal operations \(N - K\).

3. **Pseudocode**
```
read T
for each test case:
    read N and array a
    S = sum(a)
    if S == 0:
        print 0 and continue
    max_a = max(a)
    divisors = all divisors of S
    sort divisors ascending
    ops = N - 1
    for v in divisors:
        if v < max_a: continue
        current = 0, count = 0, valid = true
        for x in a:
            current += x
            if current == v:
                count += 1; current = 0
            elif current > v:
                valid = false; break
        if valid and current == 0:
            ops = N - count
            break
    print ops
```
