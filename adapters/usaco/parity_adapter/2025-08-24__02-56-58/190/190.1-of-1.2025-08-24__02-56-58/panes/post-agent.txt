[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Clumsy Cows [Brian Dean, 2012]

Bessie the cow is trying to type a balanced string of parentheses into her
new laptop, but she is sufficiently clumsy (due to her large hooves) that
she keeps mis-typing characters.  Please help her by computing the minimum
number of characters in the string that one must reverse (e.g., changing a
left parenthesis to a right parenthesis, or vice versa) so that the string
would become balanced.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: clumsy

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of even length at most 100,000
        characters.

SAMPLE INPUT:

())(

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum number of parentheses
        that must be toggled to convert the string into a balanced
        string.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The last parenthesis must be toggled, and so must one of the two middle
right parentheses.

**Calculating parentheses flips**

I'm working through a problem about balancing parentheses. If I encounter a closing parenthesis while balance is zero, I need to flip it to an opening parenthes
is with a cost of 1 and then treat it as an opening, increasing balance. If balance is greater than zero, I decrease it for matched pairs. I’ll keep track of ho
w many flips are needed, with an understanding that each unmatched opening parenthesis can potentially become a closing one. The algorithm seems to expect an ev
en length for the string to work correctly.
**Implementing parentheses balancing**

I’ve got a standard algorithm for balancing parentheses, and I’m using a sample input to illustrate it. For the string "())(", I can track the balance and flips
 needed effectively. Each unmatched closing parenthesis is flipped, transforming it into an opening one, which adjusts the balance accordingly. After going thro
ugh the string, I’ll compute the total flips required and confirm that the algorithm works for any even-length input.

Now, I’ll write the solution in a Python script, detailing problem restatement, conceptual solution, pseudocode, and the final implementation.
**Creating solution.py**

I’m preparing to create the file solution.py with the necessary implementation. I’ll start by providing a plain English restatement of what we aim to do, follow
ed by conceptualizing the solution. Then, I’ll write the pseudocode, and lastly, I’ll mention that I’m saving everything into solution.py.

The steps should be: 1) Restate the problem, 2) Conceptualize the solution, 3) Present the pseudocode, and 4) Finally confirm that the solution has been saved.
This process keeps everything clear and organized before I execute the file creation!

1. Problem restatement
Bessie types a string of parentheses but may mis-type some. We need the fewest flips (change “(” to “)” or vice versa) so the string becomes balanced (equal cou
nts and no prefix has more “)” than “(”).

2. Solution idea
- Scan left to right tracking a running balance (+1 for “(”, –1 for “)”).
- If a “)” arrives when balance is zero, we must flip it to “(” (count one flip and increment balance).
- Otherwise, match or decrement.
- After scanning, any leftover “(”s (balance > 0) need half flipped to “)” (each flip fixes two).

3. Pseudocode
```
read string s
balance ← 0
flips ← 0
for each char c in s:
    if c == '(':
        balance ← balance + 1
    else:
        if balance > 0:
            balance ← balance – 1
        else:
            flips ← flips + 1    # flip ')' to '('
            balance ← balance + 1
# now balance is # of unmatched '('
flips ← flips + (balance // 2)
print flips
```

4. Implementation
Saved as `solution.py` with the above logic.
