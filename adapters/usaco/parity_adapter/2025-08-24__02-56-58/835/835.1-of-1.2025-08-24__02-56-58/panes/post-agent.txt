[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's a hot summer day out on the farm, and Farmer John is serving lemonade to
his $N$ cows! All $N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$) like lemonade,
but some of them like it more than others. In particular, cow $i$ is willing to
wait in a line behind at most $w_i$ cows to get her lemonade. Right now all $N$
cows are in the fields, but as soon as Farmer John rings his cowbell, the cows
will immediately descend upon FJ's lemonade stand. They will all arrive before
he starts serving lemonade, but no two cows will arrive at the same time.
Furthermore, when cow $i$ arrives, she will join the line if and only if there
are at most $w_i$ cows already in line.

Farmer John wants to prepare some amount of lemonade in advance, but he does not
want to be wasteful. The number of cows who join the line might depend on the
order in which they arrive. Help him find the minimum possible number of cows
who join the line.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains $N$, and the second line contains the $N$
space-separated integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_N$.  It is guaranteed that
$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$, and that $0 \leq w_i \leq 10^9$ for each cow $i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the minimum possible number of cows who might join the line, among all
possible orders in which the cows might arrive.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 400 2 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this setting, only three cows might end up in line (and this is the smallest
possible).  Suppose the cows with $w = 7$ and $w = 400$ arrive first and wait in
line.  Then the cow with $w = 1$ arrives and turns away, since 2 cows are already
in line.  The cows with $w = 2$ then arrive, one staying and one turning away.

**Exploring joining counts**

I'm considering how to approach the problem of maximizing joining counts. The classical greedy method involves sorting in ascending order and counting how many
will join based on their arrival time. However, the challenge here is to minimize the number of joined cows by the adversary's arrival order. I need to find the
 smallest k, which represents the number of cows that join based on the arrival conditions. This requires reasoning through which cows can join while satisfying
 the line-length constraints at their arrival times.
**Determining minimal joiners**

I’m defining a set S of k cows that will join based on certain arrival orders. For each cow in the joining sequence, the condition must hold that their weight i
s greater than or equal to their position minus one. To minimize the total joiners, I need to find a small k such that a subset S exists that meets the constrai
nts. This means optimizing arrival times to ensure non-joiners have weights that lower than the current joiner count. Ultimately, I want to find the smallest k
for which there are enough cows satisfying these conditions.
**Identifying minimal joiners**

I'm trying to determine the minimum number of cows that can join given an adversarial ordering. The maximum is clear at 5, but minimizing requires understanding
 how cows with different weights can be sequenced. If larger weight cows join first, they inevitably increase the line length, causing smaller weight cows to le
ave. I can simulate different orders and test if sorting by descending weights helps achieve the goal. In several tests, it seems that descending order does con
sistently yield the minimal possible joiners based on varying scenarios.
**Finalizing the joining problem solution**

I’m determining the minimum number of cows that can join based on various weight orders. Through testing, I found that sorting weights in descending order consi
stently gives the optimal result. This approach allows larger-weight cows to join first, while smaller ones can skip as the line length increases. I’ll implemen
t this in a Python program that reads input, sorts the weights, and simulates the joining process, ensuring it's efficient with a time complexity of O(N log N).
 The final solution is ready, and I'll save it as solution.py.

**Problem Restatement**
We have N cows, each with a tolerance wᵢ (“I’ll wait behind at most wᵢ cows”). All cows arrive in some order; when cow i arrives, if the current line length c s
atisfies c ≤ wᵢ she joins (increasing c by 1), otherwise she leaves. We want the adversarial arrival order that makes as few cows join as possible, and output t
hat minimum number.

**Solution Concept**
- To minimize joins, bring the most patient cows first (largest w), since they will join even when the line is small, and this raises the line length to block l
ess patient cows later.
- Concretely: sort w in descending order; simulate with a counter c=0; for each wi in that order, if wi ≥ c, increment c. The final c is the minimum possible jo
ins.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array w of length N
sort w in descending order
c ← 0
for each wi in w:
    if wi ≥ c:
        c ← c + 1
print c
```

**solution.py**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    w = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    # Sort in descending order to minimize joins
    w.sort(reverse=True)
    c = 0
    for wi in w:
        if wi >= c:
            c += 1
    print(c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
