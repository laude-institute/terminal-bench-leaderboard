[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Balanced Cow Breeds [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John usually brands his cows with a circular mark, but his branding
iron is broken, so he instead must settle for branding each cow with a mark
in the shape of a parenthesis -- (.  He has two breeds of cows on his farm:
Holsteins and Guernseys.  He brands each of his cows with a
parenthesis-shaped mark.  Depending on which direction the cow is facing,
this might look like either a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis.

FJ's N cows are all standing in a row, each facing an arbitrary direction,
so the marks on the cows look like a string of parentheses of length N.
Looking at this lineup, FJ sees a remarkable pattern: if he scans from left
to right through just the Holsteins (in the order they appear in the
sequence), this gives a balanced string of parentheses; moreover, the same
is true for the Guernseys!  To see if this is truly a rare event, please
help FJ compute the number of possible ways he could assign breeds to his N
cows so that this property holds.

There are several ways to define what it means for a string of parentheses
to be "balanced".  Perhaps the simplest definition is that there must be
the same total number of ('s and )'s, and for any prefix of the string,
there must be at least as many ('s as )'s.  For example, the following
strings are all balanced:

()
(())
()(()())

while these are not:

)(
())(
((())))

PROBLEM NAME: bbreeds

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A string of parentheses of length N (1 <= N <= 1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

(())

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the number of ways FJ can
        assign breeds to cows so that the Holsteins form a balanced
        subsequence of parentheses, and likewise for the Guernseys.
        Since the answer might be a very large number, please print
        the remainder of this number when divided by 2012 (i.e., print
        the number mod 2012).  Breed assignments involving only one
        breed type are valid.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The following breed assignments work:

(())
HHHH

(())
GGGG

(())
HGGH

(())
GHHG

(())
HGHG

(())
GHGH

**Formulating Python solution**

The user wants a Python solution to count ways to color a string of parentheses such that both subsequences of 'H' and 'G' are balanced. First, I'll restate the
 problem clearly: given a string of parentheses, color each position as 'H' or 'G' while ensuring the subsequences formed are balanced. Next, I'll conceptualize
 a dynamic programming approach to count the valid configurations. Then, I’ll draft the pseudocode and save it to a file named solution.py.
**Developing dynamic programming approach**

I'm defining a dynamic programming table DP[i][h][g], where 'i' represents the prefix of characters, 'h' is the balance of the H-sequence, and 'g' is for the G-
sequence. However, since 'h' and 'g' could be large, I'll rethink this. The total balance gives a fixed relationship, allowing me to simplify to one dimension:
DP[i][h]. Here, 'h' must stay between 0 and a derived maximum based on the prefix balance. I'll ensure to compute transitions carefully, particularly when proce
ssing '(' characters for H and G balances.
**Translating to Python code**

I'll need to manage the depth of my dynamic programming separately from the allocated size of my DP table. The pseudocode outlines the reading of the string and
 setting up necessary variables, including mod value and previous counts. As I process each character, I need to adjust the current counts based on whether it's
 an opening or closing parenthesis.

I'll wrap the core logic in `if __name__=="__main__":`, and since this is straightforward, there's no need for an additional plan. I'll format my final response
 into distinct sections: **Restatement**, **Conceptualization**, **Pseudocode**, followed by the code in `solution.py`.

**Restatement**
- Given a string of parentheses, count ways to label each character as Holstein (H) or Guernsey (G) so that the subsequence of H-parentheses is balanced and lik
ewise for G.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Use dynamic programming over the prefix. Track `dp[h] =` number of ways where H-balance is `h` and G-balance is implied as total balance minus `h`.
- On seeing `'('`, both breeds’ balances can increase: if assigned to H, `h+1`; if to G, `h` stays.
- On `')'`, you can only assign to a breed if its balance ≥ 1: H uses `h-1`, G uses same `h` (but only if G-balance ≥ 1).
- Maintain a running `depth` = net '(' minus ')' in prefix so far; final answer is `dp[0]` when `depth` returns to 0.

**Pseudocode**
```
read s
n = len(s)
dp = array of size n+1, dp[0]=1
depth = 0
for each ch in s:
  new_dp = zero array
  if ch == '(':
    for h in 0..depth:
      ways = dp[h]
      new_dp[h+1] += ways      # assign to H
      new_dp[h]   += ways      # assign to G
    depth += 1
  else:
    for h in 0..depth:
      ways = dp[h]
      if h >= 1:
        new_dp[h-1] += ways    # ')' to H
      if depth-h >= 1:
        new_dp[h]   += ways    # ')' to G
    depth -= 1
  dp = new_dp mod 2012
print dp[0] if depth==0 else 0
```

I’ve saved this implementation in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or further validate!
