[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to take a photograph of his herd of cows.  From past
experience, he knows this particular endeavor never usually ends well.

This time, Farmer John has purchased an expensive drone in order to take an
aerial photo. To make the photo look as good as possible, he wants his cows all
to be facing the same direction when the photo is taken.  The cows are currently arranged
in an  $N \times N$ grid ($2 \leq N \leq 1000$) inside a fenced-in square
pasture,  for example:


RLR
RRL
LLR

Here, an 'R' means a cow facing right, and an 'L' means a cow facing left. Since
the cows are packed together, Farmer John cannot walk up to an individual cow to
make it turn around.  All he can do is shout at any row or column of cows to
turn around, causing L's to change to R's and R's to L's within the row or
column in question.  Farmer John can yell at as many rows or columns as he
wants, even at the same row or column more than once.

As expected, Farmer John observes that he is unable to make his cows all face
one common direction.  The best he can do is get all but one of the cows to face
the same direction.  Please determine the identity of such a cow.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines describe rows $1 \ldots N$ in
the grid of cows, each containing a string of length $N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the row and column index of a cow such that if that cow were flipped,
Farmer John could make all his cows face the same direction.  If no such cow
exists, print -1.  If multiple such cows exist, print the one with the  smallest
row index, or if multiple such cows have the same smallest row index, print the
one with the smallest column index.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
RLR
RRL
LLR
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 1

In the example above, the cow in row 1, column 1 (the upper-left corner) is the
offending cow, since Farmer John can shout at row 2 and column 3 to make all
other cows face left, with just this cow facing right.

**Exploring rank-1 representation**

I’m considering how to represent matrices using XOR, specifically whether A[i][j] can be represented as r[i] xor c[j]. This connects to whether we can create al
l zeros or ones. If not A has rank-1, then making all ones may be possible.

To toggle directions, I realize I can flip rows and columns, meaning the representation still holds if A xor D is rank-1. So, my focus is on understanding if ei
ther A or its complement can meet these criteria.
**Testing rank-1 conditions**

I’m exploring how to determine the rank-1 nature of matrix A or its complement to achieve all cows facing the same way, which translates to consistent bits bein
g either all ones or all zeros. It seems efficient detection is key since checking every cell could be too costly.

So, I’ll define matrix B, derived from A, and if B has all zeros, that means A is valid. For candidates, flipping A affects certain B entries based on their pos
itions. I realize that for toggles, we only need to ensure exactly one non-zero entry must exist to meet the conditions for a rank-1 matrix.
**Analyzing rank-1 conditions**

I'm grappling with how flipping affects the first row or column in a matrix, especially since the indices shift from 1 to N while my code uses 0 to N-1. I can't
 treat special rows differently, but I need to compute matrix B. If B is all zeros, that suggests matrix A is rank-1.

If there's exactly one inconsistent cell in B, it becomes the candidate for toggling. I realize that toggling can only fix inconsistencies in the interior cells
 of B since the first row and column remain zero. However, any attempts to create a rank-1 scenario must consider both directions, as the toggled conditions inf
luence whether the resulting form can be uniform. The toggling approach looks complex but essential for identifying inconsistencies and possible solutions.
**Structuring the solution**

The task involves several steps: first, I need to restate the problem clearly. Then, I’ll conceptualize my approach in plain English for better understanding. A
fter that, I’ll draft the pseudocode to outline how I plan to implement the solution. Finally, I’ll save everything into a file named solution.py.

So, I'll present the explanation in plain text followed by the code file creation. This structured approach will ensure that I cover all necessary components! L
et's get started.

Here’s the plan and code:

1. Restatement
   - We have an N×N grid of cows facing left (‘L’) or right (‘R’). You can flip entire rows or columns (toggling L↔R).
   - It’s impossible to make all cows face the same way, but by manually flipping exactly one cow, it becomes possible.
   - Find the position of that single cow (smallest row, then column), or print –1 if none exists.

2. Conceptual solution
   - Model each cow as a bit (R=1, L=0). Flipping rows/columns is XORing row or column masks.
   - The grid can be made uniform iff its bit pattern is “rank-1” over GF(2), meaning A[i][j] = r[i]⊕c[j].
   - Define B[i][j] = A[i][j]⊕A[i][0]⊕A[0][j]⊕A[0][0]; B must be all zeros for rank-1.
   - Count B’s interior (i,j>0). Depending on where exactly the 1’s appear in B, you can identify which cow to flip:
     - If exactly one B[i][j]==1 → flip that interior cow.
     - If all interior B’s are 1 → flip (1,1).
     - If exactly one full interior row of 1’s → flip that row’s first cow.
     - If exactly one full interior column of 1’s → flip that column’s first cow.
   - Otherwise no solution.

3. Pseudocode
   - Read N, then grid into A[][] (R→1, L→0).
   - Initialize counters: total bad = 0, row_sum[], col_sum[].
   - For i,j in 1..N−1 compute bij = A[i][j]^A[i][0]^A[0][j]^A[0][0]; update totals.
   - Build candidate list based on patterns above.
   - Output smallest candidate or –1.

4. solution.py
File solution.py has been created with the full implementation. You can run it as:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```

Let me know if you want me to test it or add anything else!
