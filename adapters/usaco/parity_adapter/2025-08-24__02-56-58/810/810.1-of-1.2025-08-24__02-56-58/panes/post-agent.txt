[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his personal trainer Bessie are hiking up Mount Vancowver. For
their purposes (and yours), the mountain can be represented as a long straight
trail of length $L$ meters ($1 \leq L \leq 10^6$). Farmer John will hike the
trail at a constant travel rate of $r_F$ seconds per meter
($1 \leq r_F \leq 10^6$). Since he is working on his stamina, he will not take
any rest stops along the way.

Bessie, however, is allowed to take rest stops, where she might find some tasty
grass. Of course, she cannot stop just anywhere! There are $N$ rest stops along
the trail ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$); the $i$-th stop is $x_i$ meters from the start
of the trail ($0 < x_i < L$) and has a tastiness value $c_i$
($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$). If Bessie rests at stop $i$ for $t$ seconds, she
receives $c_i \cdot t$ tastiness units.

When not at a rest stop, Bessie will be hiking at a fixed travel rate of $r_B$
seconds per meter ($1 \leq r_B \leq 10^6$). Since Bessie is young and fit, $r_B$
is strictly less than $r_F$.

Bessie would like to maximize her consumption of tasty grass. But she is worried
about Farmer John; she thinks that if at any point along the hike she is behind
Farmer John on the trail, he might lose all motivation to continue!

Help Bessie find the maximum total tastiness units she can obtain while making
sure that Farmer John completes the hike.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains four integers: $L$, $N$, $r_F$, and $r_B$. The
next $N$ lines describe the rest stops. For each $i$ between $1$ and $N$, the
$i+1$-st line contains two integers $x_i$ and $c_i$, describing the position of
the $i$-th rest stop and the tastiness of the grass there.

It is guaranteed that $r_F > r_B$, and $0 < x_1 < \dots < x_N < L $.  Note
that $r_F$ and $r_B$ are given in seconds per meter!

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single integer: the maximum total tastiness units Bessie can obtain.

SAMPLE INPUT:
10 2 4 3
7 2
8 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
15

In this example, it is optimal for Bessie to stop for $7$ seconds at the $x=7$ rest stop (acquiring $14$ tastiness units) and then stop for an additional $1$ se
cond at the $x=8$ rest stop (acquiring $1$ more tastiness unit, for a total of $15$ tastiness units).

**Problem Restatement**

We have a straight trail of length L meters. Farmer John (FJ) walks at a constant rate of r_F seconds per meter, never stopping. Bessie walks faster at r_B seco
nds per meter (r_B < r_F) and may stop at N designated rest stops to eat grass. The i-th rest stop is at position x_i with tastiness c_i per second of rest. Bes
sie must never fall behind FJ on the trail. Whenever Bessie reaches a rest stop, she can wait there up to the amount of time she’s “ahead” of FJ, earning c_i ⋅
(wait_time) tastiness. Compute the maximum total tastiness Bessie can collect by choosing where and how long to rest, while ensuring FJ finishes the hike.

**Conceptual Solution**

- Bessie walks faster so over any segment of distance d, she gains Δt = d ⋅ (r_F–r_B) seconds of “free” waiting time.
- To maximize tastiness, Bessie should spend all her available waiting time at the tastiest rest stops she visits, but she can only wait at a stop while she’s t
here.
- Once she passes a very tasty stop, she shouldn’t waste waiting time at any less-tasty stops before it.
- Therefore, we scan the rest stops in order of increasing position. We precompute, for each index i, the maximum tastiness among stops i…N (“suffix max”).
- Whenever we reach a stop whose tastiness equals the suffix max at that point, Bessie uses *all* accumulated free waiting time since the last chosen stop there
.
- We track the last chosen position, compute the distance from it to the current stop, convert it to waiting time (distance ⋅ (r_F–r_B)), and multiply by c_i.
- Sum across all such “peaks” gives the optimal total tastiness.

**Pseudocode**

```
read L, N, r_F, r_B
for i in 1..N:
    read x[i], c[i]
# Compute suffix maximum tastiness
suffix_max[N] = c[N]
for i in N-1 down to 1:
    suffix_max[i] = max(c[i], suffix_max[i+1])

last_position = 0
total = 0
rate_diff = r_F - r_B

for i in 1..N:
    if c[i] == suffix_max[i]:
        dist = x[i] - last_position
        wait_time = dist * rate_diff
        total += wait_time * c[i]
        last_position = x[i]

print(total)
```

**Implementation (`solution.py`)**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    L, N, rF, rB = map(int, data[:4])
    X = [0]*N
    C = [0]*N
    idx = 4
    for i in range(N):
        X[i] = int(data[idx]); C[i] = int(data[idx+1])
        idx += 2

    # Build suffix max of tastiness
    suffix_max = [0]*N
    suffix_max[-1] = C[-1]
    for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):
        suffix_max[i] = max(C[i], suffix_max[i+1])

    last_pos = 0
    total = 0
    rate_diff = rF - rB

    for i in range(N):
        if C[i] == suffix_max[i]:
            dist = X[i] - last_pos
            total += dist * rate_diff * C[i]
            last_pos = X[i]

    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save this as `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```

This uses only built-in Python modules and runs in O(N) time and memory.
