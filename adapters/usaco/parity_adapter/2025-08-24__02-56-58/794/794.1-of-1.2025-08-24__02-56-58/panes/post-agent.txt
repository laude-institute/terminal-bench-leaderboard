[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has a large field, and he is thinking of planting sweet corn in some
part of it. After surveying his field, FJ found that it forms an
$(N-1) \times (N-1)$ square. The southwest corner is at coordinates $(0,0)$, and
the northeast corner is at $(N-1,N-1)$.

At some integer coordinates there are double-headed sprinklers, each one
sprinkling both water and fertilizer. A double-heading sprinkler at coordinates
$(i,j)$  sprinkles water on the part of the field north and east of it, and
sprinkles fertilizer on the part of the field south and west of it. Formally, it
waters all real coordinates $(x,y)$ for which $N \geq x \geq i$ and
$N \geq y \geq j$, and it fertilizes all real coordinates $(x,y)$ for which
$0 \leq x \leq i$ and $0 \leq y \leq j$.

Farmer John wants to plant sweet corn in some axis-aligned rectangle in his
field with integer-valued corner coordinates. However, for the sweet corn to
grow, all points in the rectangle must be both watered and fertilized by the
double-headed sprinklers. And of course the rectangle must have positive area,
or Farmer John wouldn't be able to grow any corn in it!

Help Farmer John determine the number of rectangles of positive area in which he
could grow sweet corn. Since this number may be large, output the remainder of
this number modulo
$10^9 + 7$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $N$, the size of the
field ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$).

The next $N$ lines each contain two space-separated integers. If these integers
are $i$ and $j$, where $0 \leq i,j \leq N-1$, they denote a sprinkler located at
$(i,j)$.

It is guaranteed that there is exactly one sprinkler in each column and exactly
one sprinkler in each row. That is, no two sprinklers have the same
$x$-coordinate, and no two sprinklers have the same $y$-coordinate.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of a single integer: the number of rectangles of
positive area which are fully watered and fully fertilized, modulo $10^9 + 7$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
0 4
1 1
2 2
3 0
4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
21

[2025-08-24T07:29:55] thinking

**Interpreting sprinkler requirements**

Okay, I'm trying to make sense of the phrase "must be both watered and fertilized by the double-headed sprinklers." Does it mean each point needs to be in at le
ast one sprinkler's water zone and one fertilizer zone? Or are all sprinklers working together? Generally, sprinklers water the NE and fertilize the SW. So, the
 entire rectangle should be adequately covered: for every point, there needs to be a corresponding sprinkler that can water and fertilize it. I'm reasoning thro
ugh this carefully!
**Calculating overlapping sprinkler regions**

Alright, for each point in the rectangle, I need to find at least one sprinkler that provides water and another for fertilizer. This leads to the conclusion tha
t the rectangle must be entirely contained within the overlap of all water and fertilizer regions. The union of water and fertilizer areas needs to be understoo
d properly. I realize the key is to define sprinkler positions through a permutation that can help calculate the overlapping area effectively. I’m weaving throu
gh this complex thought process carefully!
**Implementing the solution**

I'm tackling the problem step by step. For each index, I need to calculate values based on a few summations and conditions. I realize that specific edge cases,
like when L equals j, should be skipped. Next, I'll compute cumulative sums and apply the modulo operation correctly. I'll prepare for a binary search to find t
he necessary index efficiently. Finally, I need to structure my code properly, ensuring everything is accurate and organized in solution.py, ready to go without
 extra test cases, just the main guard included.

**Solution Explanation**

1. **Problem Restatement**
   We have \(N\) sprinklers placed as a permutation \(p\) on an \(N\times N\) field.
   - A sprinkler at \((i,p[i])\) waters every point \((x,y)\) with \(x\ge i\) and \(y\ge p[i]\).
   - It fertilizes every point \((x,y)\) with \(x\le i\) and \(y\le p[i]\).
   We must count all axis-aligned integer-cornered rectangles of positive area that lie entirely within the union of all water regions _and_ within the union of
 all fertilizer regions, modulo \(10^9+7\).

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - Compute arrays
     - \(a[i]=\min\limits_{k\le i}p[k]\), the lowest \(y\) that _must_ be in any watered rectangle spanning column \(i\).
     - \(b[j]=\max\limits_{k\ge j}p[k]\), the highest \(y\) that _must_ be in any fertilized rectangle spanning column \(j\).
   - Any rectangle spanning columns \(i<j\) can only span \(y\) from \(\max(a[i])\) (over those columns) up to \(\min(b[j])\).  Monotonicity of \(a\) and \(b\)
shows that this simplifies to
     \[
       \text{lo}=a[i],\quad \text{hi}=b[j],\quad \text{and we require } \text{lo}<\text{hi}.
     \]
   - The number of ways to choose two distinct integer \(y\)-coordinates between \([\text{lo},\text{hi}]\) is
     \(\displaystyle\binom{\text{hi}-\text{lo}+1}{2}.\)
   - Sum this over all \(0\le i<j<N\).

   To do this in \(O(N\log N)\):
   - Precompute prefix sums of \(a[i]\) and \(a[i]^2\).
   - For each \(j\), binary-search the smallest \(i\) where \(a[i]<b[j]\).  Let that index be \(L\).  Then all \(i\in[L,\dots,j-1]\) qualify.
   - Using the prefix sums, compute in \(O(1)\) the sum of \(\binom{b[j]-a[i]+1}{2}\) over \(i=L\ldots j-1\).

3. **Pseudocode**

```
read N
read N pairs (x,y), set p[x]=y
a[0]=p[0]
for i=1..N-1: a[i]=min(a[i-1],p[i])
b[N-1]=p[N-1]
for i=N-2..0: b[i]=max(b[i+1],p[i])

build prefixA[i+1]=sum(a[0..i])
build prefixA2[i+1]=sum(a[0..i]^2)

result=0
for j in 1..N-1:
    bj = b[j]
    L = first index in [0..j-1] with a[L] < bj  // binary search
    if L<j:
        m = j - L
        sum1 = prefixA[j] - prefixA[L]
        sum2 = prefixA2[j] - prefixA2[L]
        // Sum of C(d+1,2) where d = bj - a[i]
        term = (m*bj^2 + m*bj - (2*bj+1)*sum1 + sum2) / 2  (mod M)
        result = (result + term) mod M

print result
```

4. **Implementation**

The complete solution is in **solution.py**. It reads from stdin, computes the result in \(O(N\log N)\), and prints it modulo \(10^9+7\). No external libraries
are used.
