[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Taxi [Mark Gordon, Richard Peng, 2013]

Bessie is running a taxi service for the other cows on the farm.  The
cows have been gathering at different locations along a fence of
length M (1 <= M <= 1,000,000,000).  Unfortunately, they have grown
bored with their current locations and each wish to go somewhere else
along the fence.  Bessie must pick up each of her friends at their
starting positions and drive them to their destinations.  Bessie's car
is small so she can only transport one cow in her car at a time.  Cows
can enter and exit the car instantaneously.

To save gas, Bessie would like to minimize the amount she has to
drive.  Given the starting and ending positions of each of the N cows
(1 <= N <= 100,000), determine the least amount of driving Bessie
has to do.  Bessie realizes that to save the most gas she may need to
occasionally drop a cow off at a position other than her destination.

Bessie starts at the leftmost point of the fence, position 0, and must
finish her journey at the rightmost point on the fence, position M.

PROBLEM NAME: taxi

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: N and M separated by a space.

* Lines 2..1+N: The (i+1)th line contains two space separated
        integers, s_i and t_i (0 <= s_i, t_i <= M), indicating the
        starting position and destination position of the ith cow.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 10
0 9
6 5

INPUT DETAILS:

There are two cows waiting to be transported along a fence of length 10.
The first cow wants to go from position 0 (where Bessie starts) to position
9.  The second cow wishes to go from position 6 to position 5.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the total amount of driving
        Bessie must do.  Note that the result may not fit into a 32 bit
        integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

12

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie picks up the first cow at position 0 and drives to position 6.
There she drops off the first cow, delivers the second cow to her
destination and returns to pick up the first cow.  She drops off the first
cow and then drives the remainder of the way to the right side of the fence.

**Analyzing taxi problem**

I’m grappling with the USACO taxi problem involving balanced parentheses that map to a stack with intervals. The goal is to minimize the total distance Bessie d
rives while factoring in different cow drop-off positions. Essentially, I need to find the minimum distance to traverse all intervals while starting at 0 and en
ding at M. It’s a matter of handling both right and left-moving intervals correctly. The total distance will include the sum of the absolute differences for eac
h cow, along with an additional distance M.
**Optimizing travel distance**

I’m considering how interruptions can help reduce extra travel by rearranging the order of cow drop-offs. The answer boils down to M plus twice the sum of the l
engths of unmatched segments from right-moving and left-moving cows. I need to sort the intervals and use a greedy pairing approach with two pointers for overla
pping segments. I’ll also consider a sweep line algorithm to keep track of events and net flow, ensuring the total distance calculation accounts for positive an
d negative flows effectively.
**Implementing solution steps**

I’m outlining the solution for Bessie’s cow delivery problem, considering capacity and movement. She can handle right-flow cows easily while moving forward, but
 left-flow cows require some backtracking. The steps are clear: read the input, create events based on the start and end positions of each cow, sort those event
s, and then sweep through them to calculate any extra distance needed. The time complexity is O(n log n), and I'll ensure to handle large sums safely in Python.
 Next, I’ll implement the pseudocode into a functional script.

Here’s the breakdown:

Restatement
- Bessie must shuttle N cows one at a time along a linear fence from various start to end positions, starting at 0 and finishing at M. She can drop a cow anywhe
re to pick up another, and wants to minimize her total driving distance.

Conceptual Solution
- Only cows whose destination lies to the left of their start force Bessie to backtrack. Treat each such cow as contributing a “reverse flow” of +1 on the inter
val [t, s). Sweep these events along the fence, tracking the current net reverse flow. Over each segment, Bessie must do an extra |flow|×segment_length of back-
and-forth, costing twice that distance. The base forward trip costs M.

Pseudocode
```
read N, M
events = []
for each cow (s, t):
    if s > t:
        events.append((t, +1))
        events.append((s, -1))
sort events by position
last = 0; curr = 0; extra = 0
for each (pos, delta) in events:
    dist = pos – last
    extra += |curr| * dist
    curr += delta
    last = pos
answer = M + 2 * extra
print(answer)
```
