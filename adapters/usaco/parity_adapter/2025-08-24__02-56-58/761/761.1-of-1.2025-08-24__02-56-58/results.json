    "instruction": "Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.\nReason through the problem and:\n1. Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nFarmer John purchases three cows: Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, each of whom\ninitially produces 7 gallons of milk per day.  Since the milk output of a cow is\nknown to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements\nover the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book.  Entries in his\nlog look like this:\n\n\n35 Bessie -2\n14 Mildred +3\n\nThe first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons\nlower than it was when last measured.  The next entry indicates that on day 14,\nMildred's  milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured. \nFarmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given\nday.  Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write\ndown his measurements in chronological order.  \n\nTo keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn\nthe picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several\ncows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures). \nPlease determine the number of days on which Farmer John would have needed to\nchange this display.\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe first line of input contains $N$, the number of measurements Farmer John\nmakes. Each of the next $N$ lines contains one measurement, in the format above,\nspecifying  a day (an integer in the range 1..100), the name of a cow, and the\nchange in her  milk output since it was last measured (a nonzero integer).  Each\ncow's milk output will always be in the  range 0..1000.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nPlease output the number of days (an integer in the range 0..100) on which\nFarmer John needs to adjust his motivational display.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n4\n7 Mildred +3\n4 Elsie -1\n9 Mildred -1\n1 Bessie +2\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n3\n\nInitially, all cows have milk output 7.  On day 1, Bessie's milk output\nincreases to 9, making her the unique cow with highest milk output and causing\nFarmer John to change his display.  On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to\n6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead. \nOn day 7, Mildred jumps into the  lead, changing the display, and on day 9,\nMildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display.\n\n\nProblem credits: Brian Dean\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
