Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John purchases three cows: Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, each of whom
initially produces 7 gallons of milk per day.  Since the milk output of a cow is
known to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements
over the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book.  Entries in his
log look like this:


35 Bessie -2
14 Mildred +3

The first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons
lower than it was when last measured.  The next entry indicates that on day 14,
Mildred's  milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured.
Farmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given
day.  Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write
down his measurements in chronological order.

To keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn
the picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several
cows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures).
Please determine the number of days on which Farmer John would have needed to
change this display.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, the number of measurements Farmer John
makes. Each of the next $N$ lines contains one measurement, in the format above,
specifying  a day (an integer in the range 1..100), the name of a cow, and the
change in her  milk output since it was last measured (a nonzero integer).  Each
cow's milk output will always be in the  range 0..1000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of days (an integer in the range 0..100) on which
Farmer John needs to adjust his motivational display.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
7 Mildred +3
4 Elsie -1
9 Mildred -1
1 Bessie +2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

Initially, all cows have milk output 7.  On day 1, Bessie's milk output
increases to 9, making her the unique cow with highest milk output and causing
Farmer John to change his display.  On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to
6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead.
On day 7, Mildred jumps into the  lead, changing the display, and on day 9,
Mildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display.

**Problem Restatement**
Three cows—Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred—each start producing 7 gallons of milk per day. Over up to 100 days, Farmer John records single measurements per day indic
ating how much a cow’s output changed from its previous value. He displays on a barn wall the photo(s) of whoever is tied for the highest output that day. We mu
st count how many days the set of displayed photos changes after processing all measurements in chronological order.

---

**Solution Concept**
- Read all measurements and sort them by day.
- Maintain each cow’s current output (start at 7).
- Track the current “leader set” (those tied for max output).
- For each measurement in day order:
  - Update that cow’s output.
  - Recompute the leader set.
  - If it differs from the previous leader set, increment a “display changes” counter and update the leader set.
- Output the counter.

---

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
measurements = []
for i in 1..N:
    read day, name, delta
    store (day, name, delta) in measurements

sort measurements by day ascending

outputs = { "Bessie":7, "Elsie":7, "Mildred":7 }
leader_set = set of all cows  # initially all tied at 7
changes = 0

for each (day, name, delta) in measurements:
    outputs[name] += delta
    max_output = max(outputs.values())
    new_leader_set = { cow for cow, out in outputs.items() if out == max_output }
    if new_leader_set != leader_set:
        changes += 1
        leader_set = new_leader_set

print changes
```

---

**solution.py**
```python
import sys

def main():
    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    n = int(input_lines[0])
    # Parse measurements
    measurements = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        day = int(input_lines[idx]); idx += 1
        name = input_lines[idx]; idx += 1
        delta = int(input_lines[idx]); idx += 1
        measurements.append((day, name, delta))
    # Sort by day
    measurements.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Initialize milk outputs
    outputs = {"Bessie": 7, "Elsie": 7, "Mildred": 7}
    # Initial leader set: all tied
    max_out = 7
    leader_set = set(outputs.keys())
    changes = 0

    # Process each measurement
    for day, name, delta in measurements:
        outputs[name] += delta
        # Recompute leaders
        max_out = max(outputs.values())
        new_leader_set = {cow for cow, val in outputs.items() if val == max_out}
        if new_leader_set != leader_set:
            changes += 1
            leader_set = new_leader_set

    print(changes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
