[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Mirror Field [Mark Gordon]

Farmer John has left some old mirrors sitting outside his house, and his
cows, feeling mischievous as always, have stolen them!

The cows have set up the mirrors in a rectangular field measuring N by M
squares (1 <= N, M <= 1,000).  In each square, they have placed a double
sided mirror between two of its opposite corners.  These two possible
configurations are represented by the '/' character (a mirror connecting
the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner) and the '\' character (a
mirror connecting the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner).

One evening, Bessie the cow brings a laser pointer out to the mirror field.
Standing outside the field, she shines the beam of light either
horizontally or vertically along either a row or column of the field,
causing it to bounce of some number of mirrors.  Since the mirrors are all
diagonally oriented, a horizontal beam of light that reflects off a mirror
will end up traveling vertically, and vice versa.  Bessie wonders what is
the maximum number of mirrors on which her beam of light can be reflected
at the same time.  Given the layout of the mirror field, please help Bessie
compute this number.

PROBLEM NAME: mirror

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integers N and M, separated by a space.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line will contain M '/' or '\' characters,
        describing a row of the mirror field.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 3
/\\
\\\
/\/

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum number of times a
        horizontal or vertical beam originating outside the mirror
        field could be reflected.  Please output -1 if it could be
        reflected indefinitely.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can shine the beam downwards above the middle column of her
field to have it reflected 3 times.

**Simulating beam movement**

I'm analyzing how to find the maximum over starting positions while checking for infinite loops — I should return -1 if one occurs. For each beam, I need to sim
ulate its movement within a grid, considering mirrors at the corners of cells. Tracking the beam’s position involves knowing the current row, column, and direct
ion. If the beam encounters a slash '/' mirror, the direction changes based on its incoming trajectory. For example, if it comes from above, it shifts direction
 to the left.
**Mapping mirror reflections**

I need to establish how standard mirror reflections work. For a slash '/', the direction changes: Up to Right, Right to Up, Down to Left, and Left to Down. This
 setup makes sense since the mirror connects the lower-left to the upper-right. When a horizontal beam from the left hits it, from Right, it reflects Up. The re
verse mapping for a backslash '\' flips directions differently. I must simulate the beam's path, tracking reflections and state transitions until the beam exits
 the grid or detects cycles. Although this could lead to many states, I might optimize with graph transitions and memoization.
**Implementing dynamic programming**

I'm considering a dynamic programming approach using recursion and cycle detection for the beam reflections. For each state identified by (row, column, directio
n), I'll define a function to determine the number of reflections until exit or a cycle is detected. If a state is out-of-bounds, it returns 0; if known, it ret
urns that value; and if revisiting, it signals a cycle. I plan to use a multi-dimensional array to track states, managing memory carefully since the total could
 be large. Additionally, implementing an iterative version may be necessary due to recursion limits in Python to efficiently handle cycles and depth.

**1. Problem Restatement**
We have an N×M grid where each cell contains a diagonal mirror (`/` or `\`). A laser beam can start from any cell-edge on the perimeter, heading straight into t
he grid (up, down, left, or right). Each time it enters a cell, it hits the mirror and turns 90°, then proceeds to the next cell in its new direction. We want t
o know the maximum number of mirrors it can reflect off before exiting the grid; if any beam can get trapped in a cycle and reflect indefinitely, output -1.

**2. Solution Outline**
- Model each “state” as (row, column, direction). There are 4 directions: up, right, down, left.
- From a state in-bounds, the mirror deterministically sends us to a next state (possibly out-of-bounds).
- We need the count of reflections from each starting state until exit, or detect if it loops forever.
- Build a memo table `dp[state]` =
  - –2 if unvisited
  - –1 if leads to an infinite loop
  - ≥0 the exact count of reflections to exit
- Also track a small `visiting[state]` flag to detect cycles on the current path.
- For each of the 2N+2M starting states, do an explicit stack-based walk:
  - Walk forward until you hit out-of-bounds (base case 0), or a known `dp`, or you revisit a “visiting” state → infinite.
  - On unwinding the stack, fill in `dp` with cumulative counts or –1 for infinite.
- If any start yields –1, print –1 immediately. Otherwise track the maximum count.

This runs in O(N·M·4) time and O(N·M·4) space, which is fine for N,M≤1000.

**3. Pseudocode**
