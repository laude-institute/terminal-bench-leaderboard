[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Photo [Travis Hance, 2013]

FJ wants to take pictures of his N cows (2 <= N <= 1,000,000,000), which
are standing in a line and conveniently numbered 1..N.  Each photograph can
capture a consecutive range of cows from the lineup, and FJ wants to make
sure that each cow appears in at least one photo.

Unfortunately, there are K unfriendly pairs of cows (1 <= K <= 1000) that
each refuse to be in the same photograph.  Given the locations of these
unfriendly pairs, please determine the minimum number of photos FJ needs to
take.

PROBLEM NAME: photo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 contains two integers, A_i and B_i, stating
        that the cows in positions A_i and B_i are unfriendly and
        therefore cannot be in the same photograph.

SAMPLE INPUT:

7 3
1 3
2 4
5 6

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, specifying the minimum number of photos FJ
        needs to take.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can take 3 photos:
- One ranging from 1 to 2.
- One ranging from 3 to 5.
- One ranging from 6 to 7.

**Structuring cow segments**

I’m working on a classic problem involving cows and unfriendly pairs. Each photo needs to cover all cows but can’t have unfriendly pairs together in the same se
gment. I want to minimize the number of segments by using a greedy approach. For each pair of cows, I’ll determine the leftmost and rightmost positions they occ
upy. To avoid including both in one segment, I’ll ensure breaks occur within the interval defined by those positions. This keeps everything organized!
**Minimizing breaks for segments**

If I break at point x for cow segments, I need to ensure that it lies between the left and right positions of forbidden pairs. Each forbidden pair must have a b
reak within their interval, leading to a challenge of determining the minimum number of breaks needed. This resembles the classic interval stabbing problem wher
e I choose the earliest finishing point from sorted intervals. I’ll sort them and count breaks needed, ensuring I handle edge cases as I go along. Finally, the
result would be the count of breaks plus one for the segments!

**Planning problem solution**

I'm aiming to fulfill the item requirements for this task. First, I want to restate the problem: FJ needs to take pictures of cows in a way that every cow appea
rs at least once, while certain pairs can't be together in the same picture. The goal is to find the minimum number of pictures needed. Next, I’ll transform tho
se unfriendly pairs into necessary break intervals and apply a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of breaks. After that, I’ll create a solution file and pr
oceed with the needed updates.
[2025-08-24T07:41:18] codex

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restated Problem
   FJ has cows numbered 1…N in a line and must cover every cow with one or more photos, each photo capturing a consecutive block. Certain pairs of cows won’t st
and together, so no photo can include both. Find the fewest photos needed.

2. Conceptual Solution
   - Each unfriendly pair (a,b) forces a “break” somewhere between their positions.
   - Model each pair as an interval [min(a,b), max(a,b)−1] of valid break positions.
   - We need the minimum number of breaks so every interval contains at least one break point = classic interval‐stabbing.
   - Greedily choose breaks at the earliest possible end points of these intervals, then the number of photos = breaks + 1.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K
intervals = []
for each of K pairs:
    l = min(a,b)
    r = max(a,b)
    intervals.append((l, r-1))
sort intervals by their end ascending
breaks = 0
current_break = -∞
for each (start, end) in intervals:
    if current_break < start:
        place a break at end
        current_break = end
        breaks += 1
print(breaks + 1)
```

I’ll now create `solution.py` with this implementation.
