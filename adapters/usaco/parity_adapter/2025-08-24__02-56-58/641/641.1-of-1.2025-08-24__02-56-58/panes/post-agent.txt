[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($3 \leq N \leq 50,000$) are all located at distinct
positions in his two-dimensional field.  FJ wants to enclose all of the cows
with a rectangular fence whose sides are parallel to the x and y axes, and he
wants this fence to be as small as possible so that it contains every cow (cows
on the boundary are allowed).

FJ is unfortunately on a tight budget due to low milk production last quarter.
He would therefore like to build an even smaller fenced enclosure if possible,
and he is willing to sell one cow from his herd to make this possible.

Please help FJ compute the smallest possible area he can enclose with his fence
after removing one cow from his herd (and thereafter building the tightest
enclosing fence for the remaining $N-1$ cows).

For this problem, please treat cows as points and the fence as a collection of
four line segments (i.e., don't think of the cows as "unit squares").  Note that
the answer can be zero, for example if all remaining cows end up standing  in a
common vertical or horizontal line.  Finally, note that since $N$ can be quite
large, you may need to be careful in how you solve this problem to make sure
your program runs quickly enough!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines each contain two
integers specifying the location of a cow.  Cow locations are positive integers
in the range $1 \ldots 40,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write a single integer specifying the minimum area FJ can enclose with his fence
after removing one carefully-chosen cow from his herd.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
2 4
1 1
5 2
17 25
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

**Formulating Python Solution**

The user is asking for a Python 3 solution to a USACO problem about minimizing the bounding rectangle area by removing one cow. I’ll start by restating the prob
lem clearly, then conceptualizing the solution in simple terms.

Next, I'll draft pseudocode for the approach, which involves identifying the extreme cows in both x and y coordinates. Finally, I’ll save the solution into a `s
olution.py` file, ensuring to stick to O(N log N) or O(N) complexity and avoiding any external libraries. Let’s piece this together!
**Structuring the Python Solution**

I’m working on a solution for the user regarding a USACO problem on minimizing the bounding rectangle area by removing one cow. First, I’ll restate the problem
clearly and then conceptualize the solution.

The core idea is to identify candidate cows based on their extreme positions. I’ll outline pseudocode that details sorting the cows and calculating areas by exc
luding specific candidates. After that, I’ll implement the code in `solution.py`, ensuring to read the input, sort the data, compute areas dynamically, and prin
t the minimum area without any external libraries involved. Let’s get this structured and coded!
**Drafting the Solution**

I’ll start by applying the necessary steps to prepare the solution for the user’s request regarding minimizing the bounding rectangle area by removing one cow.

First, I’ll restate the problem: Given N points, I need to identify one point to remove to minimize the area of the axis-aligned bounding rectangle that remains
. Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution by sorting the cow coordinates, determining the extreme points, and considering the impact of removing any extremes.

Then, I’ll provide the pseudocode, covering sorting, candidate selection, and area computation. Finally, I’ll use the relevant approach to add the `solution.py`
 file. Let’s compile everything!

1. Restatement
Given N distinct points, remove exactly one point to minimize the area of the tightest axis-aligned rectangle enclosing the remaining N–1 points.

2. Conceptual Solution
- The bounding rectangle is determined by the min/max x and y among points.
- Only points at the four extremes (minimum/second‐minimum and maximum/second‐maximum in x or y) can affect the area when removed.
- Sort points by x and by y, pick the top two and bottom two in each.
- For each candidate extreme point, simulate removing it by taking the next extreme in place of it and compute the new area.
- The smallest of these areas is the answer.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list of (x, y, idx) for each cow
sort points by x → sorted_x
sort points by y → sorted_y

extract min1_x, min2_x from sorted_x[0], sorted_x[1]
extract max1_x, max2_x from sorted_x[-1], sorted_x[-2]
(similarly for y)

candidates = set of their indices

min_area = ∞
for each idx in candidates:
    if idx == sorted_x[0].idx: x_low = sorted_x[1].x else x_low = sorted_x[0].x
    if idx == sorted_x[-1].idx: x_high = sorted_x[-2].x else x_high = sorted_x[-1].x
    (same logic for y_low, y_high using sorted_y)
    area = (x_high - x_low) * (y_high - y_low)
    min_area = min(min_area, area)

print min_area
```
