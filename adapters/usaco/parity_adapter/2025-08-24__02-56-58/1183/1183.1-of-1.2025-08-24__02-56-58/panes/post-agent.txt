[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's $N$ cows ($N \leq 3 \times 10^5)$ have heights $1, 2, \ldots, N$.  One day, the cows are
standing in a line in some order playing frisbee; let $h_1 \ldots h_N$ denote
the heights of the cows in this order (so the $h$'s are a permutation of
$1 \ldots N$).

Two cows at positions $i$ and $j$ in the line can successfully throw the frisbee
back and forth if and only if every cow between them has height lower than
$\min(h_i, h_j)$.

Please compute the sum of distances between all pairs of locations $i<j$ at
which there resides a pair of cows that can successfully throw the frisbee  back
and forth.  The distance between locations $i$ and $j$ is $j-i+1$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$. The next line of input
contains $h_1 \ldots h_N$, separated by spaces.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the sum of distances of all pairs of locations at which there  are cows
that can throw the frisbee back and forth.  Note that the large  size of
integers involved in this problem may require the use of 64-bit integer data
types (e.g., a "long long" in C/C++).

SAMPLE INPUT:
7
4 3 1 2 5 6 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
24

The pairs of successful locations in this example are as follows:


(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)

SCORING
Test cases 1-3 satisfy $N\le 5000$.Test cases 4-11 satisfy no
additional constraints.

[2025-08-24T08:08:09] thinking

**Planning problem-solving steps**

The user wants to approach the problem in a structured way: first, restate the problem, then clarify it in plain English, write pseudocode, and finally save it
as an actual Python solution. It's important not to rush into commands without a clear plan since this is a longer problem needing thought.

The task involves finding all pairs (i, j) where heights between i and j are less than the smaller height. The core challenge is to efficiently count these pair
s using concepts from monotonic stacks. So, my focus will be on outlining each step.
**Refining visibility conditions**

I realized the condition for pairs (i, j) involves ensuring the minimum height between them is less than the smaller of their heights. In simpler terms, their v
isibility relies on the maximum height in between being less than both heights.

To find valid pairs where cows can “see” each other, I could consider the nearest greater heights on both sides. The challenge is to sum these distances across
valid pairs. A known approach implies this involves counting visible pairs, which I might solve using a monotonic stack to keep track of heights efficiently whi
le maintaining valid distances.
**Preparing to implement solution**

The instructions guide me to reason through the problem step-by-step: first, restate the problem, then provide a solution concept, followed by pseudocode. After
 that, I create the `solution.py` file.

My plan is to respond with the first three sections using text, then I'll follow up with the code file. I need to ensure that the messages before creating the f
ile are brief updates, keeping the user informed. I’ll proceed by writing those initial sections and then generating `solution.py`.

**Problem Restatement (Plain English)**
We have N cows in a line, each with a unique height 1…N in some order. A pair of cows at positions i<j can toss a frisbee if every cow between them is shorter t
han the shorter of the two. We need the sum of distances (j−i+1) over all such valid pairs.

**Solution Idea (Plain English)**
Sweep left to right, keeping a monotonic stack of cows that haven’t yet been “blocked” by a taller cow to their right. For each new cow:
- While the top of the stack is shorter than the new cow, pop it and add the distance between their positions (they can see each other).
- If the stack is nonempty after popping, the new cow can see the current top (which is taller), so add that distance too.
- Push the new cow onto the stack.
This visits each cow once and each pair exactly when they become adjacent in the stack removal process.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array h[1..N]
initialize empty stack S of (height, index)
ans = 0
for i from 1 to N:
    while S not empty and S.top.height < h[i]:
        (h0, idx0) = S.pop()
        ans += (i - idx0 + 1)
    if S not empty:
        (_, idx1) = S.top
        ans += (i - idx1 + 1)
    S.push((h[i], i))
print ans
```

Now creating `solution.py` with this implementation.
