[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Ski Course Design [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has N hills on his farm (1 <= N <= 1,000), each with an
integer elevation in the range 0 .. 100.  In the winter, since there is
abundant snow on these hills, FJ routinely operates a ski training camp.

Unfortunately, FJ has just found out about a new tax that will be assessed
next year on farms used as ski training camps.  Upon careful reading of the
law, however, he discovers that the official definition of a ski camp
requires the difference between the highest and lowest hill on his property
to be strictly larger than 17.  Therefore, if he shortens his tallest hills
and adds mass to increase the height of his shorter hills, FJ can avoid
paying the tax as long as the new difference between the highest and lowest
hill is at most 17.

If it costs x^2 units of money to change the height of a hill by x units,
what is the minimum amount of money FJ will need to pay?  FJ is only
willing to change the height of each hill by an integer amount.

PROBLEM NAME: skidesign

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the elevation of a single hill.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5
20
4
1
24
21

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's farm has 5 hills, with elevations 1, 4, 20, 21, and 24.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum amount FJ needs to pay to modify the elevations
        of his hills so the difference between largest and smallest is
        at most 17 units.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

18

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ keeps the hills of heights 4, 20, and 21 as they are.  He adds mass to the
hill of height 1, bringing it to height 4 (cost = 3^2 = 9).  He shortens
the hill of height 24 to height 21, also at a cost of 3^2 = 9.

**Translating the problem**

The user wants me to restate a problem in simple terms, conceptualize a solution, write pseudocode, and save it in a specific file format. The challenge involve
s adjusting hill elevations within a cost constraint to ensure the difference between the highest and lowest hills is no greater than 17, with costs determined
by modifying each hill's height. A brute-force approach is suggested, iterating through potential height adjustments; the aim is to minimize the overall cost wh
ile adhering to the constraints.
**Formulating the solution**

Okay, I need to compute the maximum height by adding 17 to the minimum height and calculate the associated costs to find a minimum value. I’ll structure this as
 a multi-step process: restate the problem, conceptualize the solution, write pseudocode, and finally create a `solution.py` file. Since this task is straightfo
rward, I can probably give the user a direct response without too much complication.

I'll wrap everything in a `main()` function and ensure it reads input correctly, while following all guidelines.
**Preparing the messages**

I need to create two messages for the user. The first message will include a clear restatement of the problem, an overview of the solution, and pseudocode. This
 should explain the approach step-by-step for clarity. The second message will serve as a preamble informing the user that I'm about to create the `solution.py`
 file, followed by the tool call to execute that.

The first message will summarize everything clearly, while the second message will be concise and focused on the action being taken. Let’s get started!

1. Restatement
- We have N integer hills. We can raise or lower each hill by an integer amount at a cost equal to the square of that change. We need all hill heights to lie wi
thin some 17-unit range (max−min ≤ 17), minimizing total cost.

2. Conceptual solution
- Slide a 17-unit window (low,…,low+17) across possible elevations (0–100).
- For each window, compute the cost to move every hill inside it (squares of how far outside the window a hill lies).
- Choose the window with the lowest total cost.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list hills[1..N]
best_cost = ∞
for low in 0..(100−17):
  high = low + 17
  cost = 0
  for h in hills:
    if h < low:
      cost += (low − h)^2
    else if h > high:
      cost += (h − high)^2
  best_cost = min(best_cost, cost)
print best_cost
```
