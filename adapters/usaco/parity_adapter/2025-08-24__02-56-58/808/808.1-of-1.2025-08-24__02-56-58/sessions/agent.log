[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In preparation for the upcoming hoofball tournament, Farmer John is drilling his
$N$ cows (conveniently numbered $1\dots N$, where $1 \leq N \leq 100$) in
passing the ball. The cows are all standing along a very long line on one side
of the barn, with cow $i$ standing $x_i$ units away from the barn
($1 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).  Each cow is standing at a distinct location.

At the beginning of the drill, Farmer John will pass several balls to different
cows. When cow $i$ receives a ball, either from Farmer John or from another cow,
she will pass the ball to the cow nearest her (and if multiple cows are the same
distance from her, she will pass the ball to the cow farthest to the left among
these).  So that all cows get at least a little bit of practice passing, Farmer
John wants to make sure that every cow will hold a ball at least once. Help him
figure out the minimum number of balls he needs to distribute initially to
ensure this can happen, assuming he hands the balls to an appropriate initial
set of cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$. The second line contains $N$
space-separated integers, where the $i$th integer is $x_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the minimum number of balls Farmer John must initially pass to the
cows, so that every cow can hold a ball at least once.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
7 1 3 11 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
2

In the above example, Farmer John should pass a ball to the cow at $x=1$ and
pass a ball to the cow at $x=11$. The cow at $x=1$ will pass her ball to the cow
at $x=3$, after which this ball will oscillate between the cow at $x=3$ and the
cow at $x=4$. The cow at $x=11$ will pass her ball to the cow at $x=7$, who will
pass the ball to the cow at $x=4$, after which this ball will also cycle between
the cow at $x=3$ and the cow at $x=4$. In this way, all cows will be passed a
ball at least once (possibly by Farmer John, possibly by another cow).

It can be seen that there is no single cow to whom Farmer John could initially pass a ball
so that every cow would eventually be passed a ball.

**Analyzing the hoofball problem**

I’m working through the USACO problem called hoofball, where N cows are placed on a line, each passing to the nearest neighbor with ties broken to the left. The goal is to minimize the initial number of balls so that each cow receives at least one. 

The solution involves understanding the directed graph formed by their passes. Each cow has one outgoing pass, and it seems the chains formed can only lead to cycles of size 2. I'll define a pass from cow i to cow j and count incoming passes to j to determine the minimum starting points needed.
**Clarifying the ball passing rules**

I'm figuring out how to calculate the initial number of balls in this problem. The default is based on cows with an in-degree of zero, meaning they receive nothing. There’s a tricky part with mutual passing pairs, where each cow passes to the other; they create isolated 2-cycles. If both have an in-degree of one, they require one ball between them, even though they wouldn’t count since their in-degrees are greater than zero. 

So I should account for these mutual pairs by adding them to the count. However, if they receive passes from other cows, they aren't isolated, and I need to consider those edges too. In summary, the initial balls equal cows with an in-degree of zero plus any isolated mutual pairs meeting specific criteria.
**Planning the hoofball solution**

I need to address the USACO hoofball problem step by step. First, I’ll count cows that have no incoming edges (count_zero). Then, I’ll identify “special” mutual pairs where both cows pass to each other and no one else passes to either, giving them an in-degree of one (count_pair). The final answer will be count_zero plus count_pair.

Next, I want to read the inputs, sort the cow positions while maintaining their original indices, and compute the passing behavior. I’ll create an array for passes, calculate in-degrees, and count zero in-degrees and mutual pairs. This outlines the steps clearly, but I’ll need to write this solution in a structured format and create the corresponding Python file afterward.
**Organizing the solution approach**

I’m laying out the steps to finalize the response for the hoofball problem. First, I’ll restate the problem in clear terms, explaining that we have N cows at distinct positions on a line, each passing to the nearest neighbor, to find the minimum initial balls needed.

Next, I’ll describe the conceptual solution, focusing on creating a directed graph and noting that cows with no incoming edges and isolated mutual pairs require initial balls. I’ll then provide pseudocode for the implementation, and finally, I’ll create the solution file with all the logic needed. 

Oh, also considering edge cases, like N=1, where a single cow doesn’t pass but gets a ball. I’ll handle that specifically in the code before proceeding with everything else.

1. Problem Restatement  
- We have N cows standing at distinct positions along a line. When a cow receives a ball, she immediately passes it to her nearest neighbor (choosing the left one if there’s a tie). We want the smallest number of balls that must be initially handed out so that every cow ends up holding a ball at least once.

2. Conceptual Solution  
- Model each cow as a node with a single outgoing edge to the nearest neighbor.  
- Any cow with zero incoming edges must start with a ball.  
- Additionally, any isolated 2-cow cycle (two cows passing only to each other, and no one else passes to them) still needs one starting ball.  
- Answer = (count of cows with zero in-degree) + (count of isolated mutual pairs).

3. Pseudocode  
```
read n and list xs
if n == 1:
    print 1 and exit
sort xs into xs_sorted
for each index i in [0..n-1]:
    compute distance to left neighbor (if any) and right neighbor (if any)
    pass_to[i] = index of nearer neighbor (tie → left)
compute in_deg array by counting incoming edges
zero_in = count of in_deg[i] == 0
pair_count = 0
for i in [0..n-1]:
    let j = pass_to[i]
    if j > i and pass_to[j] == i and in_deg[i] == 1 and in_deg[j] == 1:
        pair_count += 1
print zero_in + pair_count
```

4. Solution Code  
The solution has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:
