Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.
Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English

4. Save your solution as solution.py
No outside libraries are allowed.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Farmer John has $N$ cows ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$). Each cow has a breed that is
either Guernsey or Holstein.  As is often the case, the cows are standing in a
line, numbered $1 \ldots N$ in this order.

Over the course of the day, each cow writes down a list of cows.  Specifically,
cow $i$'s list contains the range of cows starting with herself (cow $i$) up to
and including cow $E_i$ ($i \leq E_i \leq N$).

FJ has recently discovered that each breed of cow has exactly one distinct
leader. FJ does not know who the leaders are, but he knows that each leader must
have a list that includes all the cows of their breed, or the other breed's
leader (or both).

Help FJ count the number of pairs of cows that could be leaders. It is
guaranteed that there is at least one possible pair.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The second line contains a string of length $N$, with the $i$th character
denoting the breed of the $i$th cow (G meaning Guernsey and H meaning Holstein).
It is guaranteed that there is at least one Guernsey and one Holstein.

The third line contains $E_1 \dots E_N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the number of possible pairs of leaders.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
GHHG
2 4 3 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

The only valid leader pair is $(1, 2)$. Cow $1$'s list contains the other
breed's leader (cow $2$). Cow $2$'s list contains all cows of her breed
(Holstein).

No other pairs are valid. For example, $(2,4)$ is invalid since cow $4$'s list
does not contain the other breed's leader, and it also does not contain all cows
of her breed.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
GGH
2 3 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

There are two valid leader pairs, $(1, 3)$ and $(2, 3)$.

SCORING
Inputs 3-5: $N \leq 100$Inputs 6-10: $N \leq 3000$Inputs 11-17: No additional constraints.

Here’s the breakdown:

**1. Problem Restatement**
You have N cows in a line, each either Guernsey (G) or Holstein (H). Cow i lists the cows from i up to E_i. Exactly one Guernsey and one Holstein are “leaders.”
 A leader’s list must either cover every cow of its own breed (i.e. span from the first to the last of that breed) or include the other leader. Count how many (
G, H) pairs satisfy both cows’ requirements.

**2. Solution Concept**
- Find the index range of each breed (min and max positions).
- A cow can “cover all its breed” only if it begins at the breed’s first occurrence and its E_i reaches that breed’s last occurrence.
- There are three valid pair types:
  1. Both leaders cover all their breeds (one G, one H).
  2. The G leader covers all G; the H leader doesn’t cover all H but does include the G leader in its interval.
  3. The H leader covers all H; the G leader doesn’t cover all G but does include the H leader.
- Use a difference‐array approach to count, for case 2, how many H‐intervals (that don’t cover all H) include the special G; and symmetrically for case 3.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N
read breeds string (1-based)
read E[1..N]

compute minG, maxG over positions of 'G'
compute minH, maxH over positions of 'H'

AG_i = first G index i where i≤minG and E[i]≥maxG (else None)
AH_j = first H index j where j≤minH and E[j]≥maxH (else None)

collect G_intervals = [(i,E[i]) for G cows with not AG]
collect H_intervals = [(j,E[j]) for H cows with not AH]

ans = (1 if AG_i and AH_j both exist else 0)

if AG_i exists:
  build diff over H_intervals
  prefix→cov
  ans += cov[AG_i]

if AH_j exists:
  build diff over G_intervals
  prefix→cov
  ans += cov[AH_j]

print(ans)
```

**4. solution.py**
I’ve saved the full implementation as `solution.py` in the workspace. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
