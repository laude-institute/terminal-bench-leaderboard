[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Tied Down [Brian Dean, 2012]

As we all know, Bessie the cow likes nothing more than causing mischief on
the farm.  To keep her from causing too much trouble, Farmer John decides
to tie Bessie down to a fence with a long rope.  When viewed from above,
the fence consists of N posts (1 <= N <= 10) that are arranged along
vertical line, with Bessie's position (bx, by) located to the right of this
vertical line.  The rope FJ uses to tie down Bessie is described by a
sequence of M line segments (3 <= M <= 10,000), where the first segment
starts at Bessie's position and the last ends at Bessie's position. No
fence post lies on any of these line segments.  However, line segments may
cross, and multiple line segments may overlap at their endpoints.

Here is an example of the scene, viewed from above:



To help Bessie escape, the rest of the cows have stolen a saw from the
barn.  Please determine the minimum number of fence posts they must cut
through and remove in order for Bessie to be able to pull free (meaning she
can run away to the right without the rope catching on any of the fence posts).

All (x,y) coordinates in the input (fence posts, Bessie, and line segment
endpoints) lie in the range 0..10,000.  All fence posts have the same x
coordinate, and bx is larger than this value.

PROBLEM NAME: tied

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: N, M, bx, by.

* Lines 2+N..2+N+M: Each of these M+1 lines contains, in sequence, the
        space-separated x and y coordinates of a point along the rope.

**Analyzing Bessie’s escape**

I’m thinking about Bessie's escape route related to the rope and the posts. Bessie is right outside the rope, and I’m realizing that she can escape without crossing any segments. The posts exist to hold the rope but don't obstruct her path directly. The critical part is how the rope winds around these posts, creating entanglements. If I cut the posts, I can free the rope loops around them. I need to calculate how many times the rope winds around each post.
**Determining post removals**

I need to find out which posts to remove so that the rope can slide to the right and clear Bessie’s path. It's similar to a classical problem where I resolve minimal removals to untie a knotted rope pinned by posts. I should focus on the rope crossings with a vertical line, noting where the rope intersects specific y-coordinates. By tracking these crossings and pairing them, I’ll create segments between posts that pin the rope. To free the rope, it’ll be essential to remove posts within those intervals.
**Identifying posts for removal**

I remember the USACO problem about the rope segments and fence line. I need to find segments of rope on the left side of the fence, defined by consecutive intersections. Each segment wraps around posts found between the y-coordinates of these intersections. I need to determine the intervals represented by these segments and choose posts to remove. The goal is to ensure each interval has at least one post removed so that the rope can slide to the right freely. This requires selecting the minimum number of posts to break all intervals effectively.
**Planning the algorithm**

I'm analyzing the minimum hitting set problem for intervals with discrete points. Using a greedy approach, I should sort the intervals by their right endpoint and choose the smallest y-value from the posts that fall within each interval. However, given that I have a manageable number of posts, a dynamic programming approach might work better, exploring all subsets to find the best coverage for all intervals.

I need to determine crossing points between rope segments and the fence, collecting y-coordinates as I go. I’ll ensure that I only count segments that cross the fence, and if I find an odd number of crossings, something must be wrong. Next, I’ll build the necessary intervals for each crossing.

The plan involves reading the posts and constructing bitmasks for each interval to represent which posts fall within them. The goal is to find a minimal subset of post indices that will ensure each interval has at least one corresponding post chosen for removal. I’ll brute-force through the subsets using their popcount to identify the smallest valid subset. After calculating the necessary operations, I’m ready to conceptualize and implement the solution.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restatement  
   - We have a vertical fence line with N posts at the same x-coordinate. Bessie is tied by a closed rope (a polygonal chain) that starts/ends at her point to the right of the fence. Each time the rope crosses the fence line, it creates a “loop” on the left side between two consecutive crossings. Any fence post whose y-coordinate lies between those two crossing y’s is snagged by that loop. To free Bessie, we must remove (cut) posts so that every such loop has at least one post removed (so the rope can slide off). Find the minimum number of posts to remove.

2. Conceptual solution  
   - Compute all crossings of the rope with the vertical line x = fence_x, in the order the rope is drawn.  
   - Pair them up (first with second, third with fourth, …): each pair defines an interval [y_low, y_high].  
   - For each interval, record which posts lie in it (a bitmask).  
   - Find the smallest subset of posts (bitmask) that “hits” every interval mask (i.e. shares at least one bit). With N ≤ 10 we can brute-force all 2^N subsets.

3. Pseudocode

This runs in O(M + 2^N·#intervals), which is fine for N≤10, M≤10⁴. Let me know if you’d like any tests or tweaks!
