[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Beauty Pageant (Silver Level) [Brian Dean]

Hearing that the latest fashion trend was cows with three spots on their
hides, Farmer John has purchased an entire herd of three-spot cows.
Unfortunately, fashion trends tend to change quickly, and the most popular
current fashion is cows with only one spot!

FJ wants to make his herd more fashionable by painting each of his cows in
such a way that merges their three spots into one.  The hide of a cow is
represented by an N by M grid of characters like this:

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Here, each 'X' denotes part of a spot.  Two 'X's belong to the same spot if
they are vertically or horizontally adjacent (diagonally adjacent does not
count), so the figure above has exactly three spots.  All of the cows in
FJ's herd have exactly three spots.

FJ wants to use as little paint as possible to merge the three spots into
one.  In the example above, he can do this by painting only four
additional characters with 'X's (the new characters are marked with '*'s
below to make them easier to see).

................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX*...XX...
.XXXX..**..XXX..
...*....XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

Please help FJ determine the minimum number of new 'X's he must paint in
order to merge three spots into one large spot.

PROBLEM NAME: pageant

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M (1 <= N,M <= 50).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains a length-M string of 'X's and '.'
        specifying one row of the cow hide pattern.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6 16
................
..XXXX....XXX...
...XXXX....XX...
.XXXX......XXX..
........XXXXX...
..XXX....XXX....

INPUT DETAILS:

The pattern in the input shows a cow hide with three distinct spots.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of new 'X's that must be added to the
        input pattern in order to obtain one single spot.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Four 'X's suffice to join the three spots into one.

**Solving the Pageant Problem**

I’m tackling the USACO “pageant” problem, where I need to connect three components on a grid with the fewest cells painted. Essentially, I want to merge three d
isconnected sections, and each new cell costs one unit. This is similar to the Steiner Tree problem but with three terminals. The standard approach involves lab
eling the components using a breadth-first search (BFS). From there, I can calculate the minimal distance for each cell to reach a component, ensuring I minimiz
e the additions needed.
**Calculating Connection Costs**

I need to compute distances for the components in a grid, starting with distances set to zero for the original cells. I’ll use BFS to fill in the costs, conside
ring that moving into a '.' cell adds 1 to the cost, while moving into an 'X' cell is free. Essentially, I want to determine the total cost to connect three com
ponents through a single cell while adjusting for the overlap in counting when a cell is a '.'.

The approach involves calculating cost for each cell and then minimizing the total cost across cells, factoring in adjustments for painting cells when necessary
. The ultimate goal is to find the minimal additional costs for connecting the components.
**Preparing Solution for Steiner Tree**

I’m working on the USACO silver problem, which is about finding the Steiner tree with three terminals. First, I’ll read the grid input and identify the three co
mponents by using a BFS flood fill. For each component, I’ll compute a distance map with a 0-1 BFS using a deque, marking distances to '.' and 'X'.

After computing the distances, I’ll sum them while adjusting for the overlap in painting costs. I also need to prepare a structured response with a restatement
of the problem, a conceptual solution, and pseudocode before finally implementing the solution in a Python file. I’ll ensure I include necessary imports and han
dle input/output correctly.

**Problem Restatement**
We have an N×M grid with exactly three connected “spots” of ‘X’ cells (adjacent horizontally/vertically). We want to paint the fewest empty cells (‘.’) into ‘X’
 so that all three spots become one connected spot.

**Solution Concept**
- Label the three original spots via flood-fill.
- For each spot, run a 0–1 BFS from all its cells: moving into an existing ‘X’ costs 0; moving into ‘.’ costs 1 (we’d have to paint it). This yields, for each g
rid cell, the minimal paint-cost to connect that spot to the cell.
- For every cell, sum the three spot-distances. If that cell is ‘.’ we’ve counted painting it three times but only need to paint once, so subtract 2. The minimu
m over all cells is the answer.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
read grid[N][M]
label = 0
for each cell:
  if it's 'X' and unlabeled:
    label++
    flood-fill to mark component label, record its cells

for each of the 3 labels i:
  initialize dist[i][x][y] = INF
  deque = all cells of component i with dist=0
  while deque nonempty:
    pop (x,y)
    for each neighbor (nx,ny):
      cost = 0 if grid[nx][ny]=='X' else 1
      if dist[i][x][y]+cost < dist[i][nx][ny]:
        update dist and pushleft if cost=0 else pushright

ans = INF
for each cell (i,j):
  if all dist[0..2][i][j] < INF:
    total = sum(dist) - (2 if grid[i][j]=='.' else 0)
    ans = min(ans, total)

print ans
```
