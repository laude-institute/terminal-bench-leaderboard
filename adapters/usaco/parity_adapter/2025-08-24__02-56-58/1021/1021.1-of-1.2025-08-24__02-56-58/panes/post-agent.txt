[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's pasture can be represented by a $N\times N$  square grid
$(1\le N\le 300)$ consisting of positions $(i,j)$ for all $1\le i,j\le N$. For
each square of the grid, the corresponding character in the input is equal to
'*' if there exists a single cow at that position and '.' if there does not
exist a cow at that position.

FJ believes that the beauty of his pasture is directly proportional to the
number of triples of cows such that their positions are equidistant from each
other. In other words, they form an equilateral triangle. Unfortunately, it was
only quite recently that FJ realized that since all of his cows are located at
integer coordinates, no beautiful triples can possibly exist if Euclidean
distance is used! Thus, FJ has decided to switch to use "Manhattan" distance
instead. Formally, the Manhattan distance between two positions $(x_0,y_0)$ and
$(x_1,y_1)$ is equal to $|x_0-x_1|+|y_0-y_1|$.

Given the grid representing the positions of the cows, compute the number of
equilateral triples.

SCORING:
There will be fourteen test cases aside from the sample, one for each of
$N\in \{50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,275,300,300,300,300\}.$

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N.$

For each $1\le i\le N,$ line $i+1$ of the input contains a string of length $N$
consisting solely of the characters '*' and '.'. The $j$th character
describes whether there exists a cow at position $(i,j)$ or not.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single integer containing the answer. It can be shown that it fits into
a signed 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
*..
.*.
*..
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

There are three cows, and they form an equilateral triple because the Manhattan
distance between each pair of cows is equal to two.

[2025-08-24T08:08:04] thinking

**Exploring triangle orientations**

I'm thinking about a triangle formed by three points of a diamond, which has four vertices. There are four possible orientations for the triangles. Each triangl
e can be made up of any three of the diamond's points, but only certain combinations on a grid will actually work. If the diamond is centered at a grid point, I
 should check for points with different offsets. I need to make sure I count each triangle once, but what if different centers create duplicates?
**Examining triangle calculation**

I realize that a triangle comes from a unique diamond, using three of its vertices. Computing the diamond's center involves averaging the vertices, but it's not
 an integer, so I need to avoid double counting. There are actually eight oriented triangles due to mirroring. I can list distinct shapes based on the diamond p
oints, like up-right-down. For my algorithm, I’ll check each center and radius on a grid, which could lead to a high number of iterations. Improving efficiency
with a boolean matrix and limiting the radius based on the center's position might help!
**Structuring triangle counting**

I’m refining my approach to counting unique triangles formed by cow positions on a grid. First, I’m thinking about the efficiency of scanning distances, which l
eads to a cubic complexity, but maybe there’s a better way by adjusting loop orders. I’ll check centers and valid triangles for all positions.

To improve speed, I’ll create a boolean occupancy grid and simplify the triangle counting logic, reducing redundant checks. My next steps involve writing pseudo
code, implementing in Python, and organizing the whole solution clearly. Then, I’ll see if the user wants to run it!

Here’s the requested breakdown and implementation.

1. Restatement
– We have an N×N grid with cows (‘*’) at some integer coordinates.
– We want to count how many triples of cows form an “equilateral triangle” under Manhattan (L₁) distance—i.e. all three pairwise L₁ distances are equal.

2. Conceptual solution
– In the L₁ metric, the locus of points at distance d from a center is a diamond (a 45°-rotated square).
– Any equilateral triangle of side k=2r must consist of three of the four “diamond” points at offsets (±r,0) and (0,±r) around some center.
– For each possible center (i,j) and radius r, look at the four neighbors: up=(i−r,j), right=(i,j+r), down=(i+r,j), left=(i,j−r).
  – If exactly three of those four positions have cows, that’s one triangle.
  – If all four have cows, that yields four different triangles (one for each choice of which corner to omit).
– Sum over all centers and r.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read grid of size N×N
build boolean occupied[N][N]
ans = 0
for r in 1..N//2:
  for i in r..N−1−r:
    for j in r..N−1−r:
      up    = occupied[i−r][j]
      right = occupied[i][j+r]
      down  = occupied[i+r][j]
      left  = occupied[i][j−r]
      c = up+right+down+left
      if c == 3: ans += 1
      elif c == 4: ans += 4
print(ans)
```

4. solution.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    rows = data[1:]
    occupied = [[c == '*' for c in row] for row in rows]
    ans = 0
    # Maximum meaningful r is floor(N/2)
    for r in range(1, N//2 + 1):
        # centers must be at least r away from each border
        for i in range(r, N - r):
            row_i = occupied[i]
            row_up = occupied[i - r]
            row_down = occupied[i + r]
            for j in range(r, N - r):
                # check the four diamond points
                c = (
                    row_up[j]       # up
                    + row_i[j + r]  # right
                    + row_down[j]   # down
                    + row_i[j - r]  # left
                )
                if c == 3:
                    ans += 1
                elif c == 4:
                    ans += 4
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

No outside libraries are used. This runs in O(N³) worst-case (≈10⁷–10⁸ simple ops for N=300), which should be acceptable in optimized Python.
