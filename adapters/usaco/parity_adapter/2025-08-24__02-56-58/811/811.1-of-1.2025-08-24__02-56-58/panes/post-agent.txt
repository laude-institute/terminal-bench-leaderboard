[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It's winter on the farm, and that means snow! There are $N$ tiles on the path
from the farmhouse to the barn, conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, and tile $i$
is covered in $f_i$ feet of snow.

Farmer John starts off on tile $1$ and must reach tile $N$ to wake up the cows.
Tile $1$ is sheltered by the farmhouse roof, and tile $N$ is sheltered by the
barn roof, so neither of these tiles has any snow. But to step on the other
tiles, Farmer John needs to wear boots!

In his foul-weather backpack, Farmer John has $B$ pairs of boots, numbered
$1 \dots B$. Some pairs are more heavy-duty than others, and some pairs are more
agile than others. In particular, pair $i$ lets FJ step in snow at most $s_i$
feet deep, and lets FJ move at most $d_i$ forward in each step.

Unfortunately, the boots are packed in such a way that Farmer John can only
access the topmost pair at any given time. So at any time, Farmer John can
either put on the topmost pair of boots (discarding his old pair) or discard the
topmost pair of boots (making a new pair of boots accessible).

Farmer John can only change boots while standing on a tile. If that tile has $f$
feet of snow, both the boots he takes off AND the boots he puts on must be able
to withstand at least $f$ feet of snow. Intermediate pairs of boots which he
discards without wearing do not need to satisfy this restriction.

Help Farmer John minimize waste, by determining the minimum number of pairs of
boots he needs to discard in order to reach the barn.  You may assume that
Farmer John is initially not wearing any boots.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $B$
($2 \leq N,B \leq 250$).

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers.  The $i$th integer is
$f_i$, giving the depth of snow on tile $i$ ($0 \leq f_i \leq 10^9$). It's
guaranteed that $f_1 = f_N = 0$.

The next $B$ lines contain two space-separated integers each. The first integer
on line $i+2$ is $s_i$, the maximum depth of snow in which pair $i$ can step.
The second integer on line $i+2$ is $d_i$, the maximum step size for pair $i$.
It's guaranteed that $0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq d_i \leq N-1$.

The boots are described in top-to-bottom order, so pair $1$ is the topmost pair
in FJ's backpack, and so forth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of a single integer, giving the minimum number of
boots Farmer John needs to discard. It's guaranteed that it will be possible for FJ to make it to the barn.

10 4
0 2 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 0

[2025-08-24T07:22:29] thinking

**Structuring problem-solving steps**

The user wants me to tackle a multi-step request, including restating the problem, conceptualizing a solution, writing pseudocode, and implementing the solution
 in a file called solution.py. Since this request is complex, it's beneficial to create an update plan that outlines the steps sequentially. Steps will be marke
d as in progress and completed as I move through them. I think my final approach might involve dynamic programming to achieve an efficient solution.
**Clarifying boot management for the problem**

I’m considering the boot management aspects of the problem. Essentially, I have two stacks to think about: one for the backpack and one for the current boot. Th
e backpack has fixed contents, and I can either wear or discard the topmost boot.

This scenario is similar to the classic "snow boots" problem, but here it's about minimizing discards while dealing with fixed sequences. FJ starts with no boot
s at tile 1, where there's no snow, so he can only change boots there. He needs to wear boots that support zero snow initially.

There should be a clear strategy for the initial action regarding boots, focusing on minimizing discards as he progresses. The state will depend on both the cur
rent boot and the backpack's position.
**Understanding boot discard logic**

I’m diving into the mechanics of discarding and wearing boots in this problem. The decisions involve either popping the topmost boot from the backpack and incre
asing the discard count or wearing it while removing the previous pair. Each time I change boots, I have to consider both old and new pairs, with all discards c
ounting.

While calculating total discards, both types—discarding old boots and those not worn—contribute to the count. My goal is to minimize the total number of discard
ed boots as FJ progresses. The dynamic programming approach will help manage the various states as timber is reached.
**Formulating a plan for the solution**

I’m developing a clear approach to solve this problem. First, I need to find the smallest boot index j that allows a successful path to tile N while minimizing
discards. The strategy involves using BFS to explore reachable states with actual boots available and discarding unnecessary items.

I’ll set up a binary search for the minimal T threshold and implement a function to check if the path is viable with the current boots. This will guide the nece
ssary steps for reaching my final solution effectively. My plan includes restating the problem, conceptualizing the solution, writing pseudocode, and then imple
menting it in solution.py.

[2025-08-24T07:23:29] codex

I’ve added **solution.py** with a Python implementation that:

- Restates the problem logic in comments.
- Uses a binary search over the maximum boot index allowed.
- Checks reachability via BFS on (tile, boot) states for each candidate.
- Prints the minimal number of discards.

Let me know if you’d like test runs or further tweaks!
