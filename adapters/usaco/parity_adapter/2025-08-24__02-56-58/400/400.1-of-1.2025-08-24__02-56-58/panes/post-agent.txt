[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Roadblock [Brian Dean]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25,000), each with an associated length.
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
his morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 7
2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7
4 5 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the
house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's
        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a
        single pathway.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4
(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,
of total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.

[2025-08-24T08:22:59] thinking

**Planning solution steps**

The user is looking for a complete solution in "solution.py" and wants me to go through a few steps first. I think I’ll restate the problem, conceptualize, writ
e pseudocode, and then create the solution file.

Since it seems straightforward, I might not need an elaborate plan; just outlining the four steps in plain text should work. My focus will be on providing the c
ode to "solution.py" as I implement it, doubling each edge and recalculating the shortest path using Dijkstra.
**Seeking optimization in shortest paths**

I need the original shortest path length first, but I realize using Dijkstra M+1 times would be too slow, given M could be up to 25,000. Running it like that co
uld lead to billions of operations.

So, I’m thinking we should focus on the shortest path tree and track edges only from the initial path. If we double an edge that's not on the shortest path, it
won't change the length – but there are nuances with multiple paths that could influence the outcome. I’ll consider only edges in the shortest path for adjustme
nts.
**Finalizing shortest path solution**

I’m concluding that doubling edges not on the initial shortest path doesn't affect it, so I’ll only consider edges on that path. To find the new shortest path a
fter doubling an edge, I need to run Dijkstra from the source, storing parents for reconstruction.

After reconstructing the path, I’ll double the relevant edge weights, rerun Dijkstra, and calculate the differences. I can build a structured adjacency list, ma
nage weights efficiently, and implement everything in "solution.py." The plan is to ensure the output is just the best increase found.

**Restated Problem**
FJ walks from field 1 to field N along the shortest route. The cows will pick one pathway and double its length to maximize how much that increases the shortest
‐route distance. Compute that maximum increase.

**Solution Concept**
- Use Dijkstra to find FJ’s original shortest distance and record the exact path edges.
- For each edge on this path, temporarily double its weight, rerun Dijkstra, and measure the new shortest distance.
- Track the largest increase and restore the edge weight.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
for each edge i:
    store endpoints u, v and weight w
    build adjacency list: adj[u] += (v,i), adj[v] += (u,i)
run dijkstra from node 1 → dist0, parent_edge, parent_node
orig = dist0[N]
reconstruct path_edges by walking parents from N back to 1
best_inc = 0
for eid in path_edges:
    weights[eid] *= 2
    run dijkstra → dist_new
    best_inc = max(best_inc, dist_new[N] - orig)
    weights[eid] //= 2
print best_inc
```

The full implementation is saved as `solution.py`.
