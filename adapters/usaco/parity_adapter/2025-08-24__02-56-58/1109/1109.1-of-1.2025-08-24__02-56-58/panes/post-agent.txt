[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The fence surrounding Farmer John's largest pasture has fallen into disrepair,
and he has finally decided to replace it with a new fence.

Unfortunately, as Farmer John is laying out the new fence, a large bee ends up
chasing him around the pasture, and as a result, the fence ends up following a
rather irregular path.  The fence can be described by a string of characters,
each either "N" (north), "E" (east), "S" (south),  or "W" (west).  Each
character describes a 1-meter run of the fence.  For example, if the string is
NESW, this means the fence starts by moving north for 1 meter, then east for 1
meter, then south for 1 meter, then west for  1 meter, returning to its starting
point.

The fence ends at the position where it started, and this is the only point
visited more than once by the path of the fence (and the starting point is only
re-visited once, at the end).  As a result, the fence does indeed enclose a
single connected region of the grassy pasture, even though this region could
have a rather strange shape.

Farmer John is curious if the path in which he laid the fence traveled clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the right side of the fence as one walks along the
path of the fence in the order specified by the string) or counter-clockwise
(with the enclosed region on the left side of the fence).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 20$).  Each  of
the next $N$ lines contains a string of length at least 4 and at most 100,
describing a single fence path.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $N$ fence paths described in the input, output a line containing
either "CW" (clockwise) or "CCW" (counterclockwise).

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
NESW
WSSSEENWNEESSENNNNWWWS
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
CW
CCW

The two fence paths with @ denoting the starting point:

*<@     *

[2025-08-24T08:19:44] thinking

**Processing path directions**

I’m thinking about how to create a program that outputs "CW" for clockwise paths and "CCW" for counterclockwise ones. This involves calculating the signed area
of a polygon using the shoelace formula. Starting from (0,0), I’ll interpret the movements based on the input string, creating a list of points that closes the
path. It’s important to remember that a positive area indicates a CCW direction and a negative area indicates CW. That should give a clear solution!
**Implementing fence direction output**

I need to create a program that outputs "CW" for clockwise paths and "CCW" for counterclockwise ones. To determine this, I will calculate the signed area based
on the input, considering negative areas imply clockwise. Since the path must have a length of at least 4, I won't encounter zero areas. I’ll restate the proble
m, conceptualize the solution, and write pseudocode. Then, I’ll implement the code in a file named solution.py and ensure it reads input correctly while checkin
g the area sign.
**Creating solution implementation**

I need to print outputs one per line and implement the approach through the code. The function will determine the path's orientation, calculating the vertices b
ased on the given directions. The signed area will help establish if the path is clockwise or counterclockwise.

I’ll outline the restatement of the problem, conceptual solutions, and pseudocode. After that, I’ll create solution.py to implement everything. Before patching,
 I'll let the user know I'm about to create the file.

So to recap: I’ll provide the restatement, conceptualization, and pseudocode first, then notify about creating the solution.py file, and finally apply the patch
.

1. Problem restated:
Farmer John walks a closed path made of N/E/S/W steps forming a simple polygon. We need to decide if the path goes clockwise (region on your right) or counter-c
lockwise.

2. Conceptual solution:
- Track the polygon’s vertices by simulating each step from (0,0).
- Compute the signed area via the shoelace formula.
- A negative signed area means the vertices wind clockwise, positive means counter-clockwise.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read integer n
for each of the n paths:
    start at x=y=0, add (0,0) to vertex list
    for each direction c in path:
        update x,y based on c
        append (x,y) to vertex list
    area2 = 0
    for i from 0 to len(vertices)-2:
        x1,y1 = vertices[i]
        x2,y2 = vertices[i+1]
        area2 += x1*y2 - x2*y1
    if area2 < 0:
        print "CW"
    else:
        print "CCW"
```

I’ve created `solution.py` with this implementation.
