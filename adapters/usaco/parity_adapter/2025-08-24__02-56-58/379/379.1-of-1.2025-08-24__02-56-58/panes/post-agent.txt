[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second.
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down.
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

PROBLEM NAME: slowdown

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The value of N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line is of the form "T x" or "D x", indicating a
        time event or a distance event.  In both cases, x is an
        integer that is guaranteed to place the event before Bessie
        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for
        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to
        slow down quite a bit all at once.  Events may not be listed
        in order.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
T 30
D 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2970

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds.
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her
980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.

**Implementing time and distance simulation**

I'm thinking about how to maintain the current time, count slowdowns, and calculate speed with the equation speed = 1/(slowdowns + 1). I’ll sort time and distan
ce events and use two pointers to simulate the next event by comparing them. I'll continue advancing until the distance reaches 1000, at which point I’ll comput
e the final time rounded to the nearest integer.

Then I'll implement the solution in Python, ensuring to handle edge cases where events may coincide. I want to ensure accurate comparisons between times and dis
tances using a small epsilon for float precision.
**Coding event simulation logic**

I’m setting EPS to 1e-9 for comparing values. I’ll sort the time and distance events and initialize my pointers. In the loop, while I still have events, I need
to calculate the next event times. If both event lists are exhausted, I’ll break out.

For each iteration, I calculate the next time and distance events, considering infinity when an event is out of range. If the current distance reaches 1000, I’l
l break. I'll also calculate the time needed to finish the journey, and if it’s less than or equal to the next event time, I’ll just jump to the finish. Finally
, I'll implement this in Python and ensure it outputs the rounded result correctly.

[2025-08-24T08:21:28] codex

I’ve added a `solution.py` script that:

- Reads and sorts time (`T`) and distance (`D`) slowdown events.
- Simulates Bessie’s run by always advancing to the next event or finish.
- Updates time, distance, and slowdown count accordingly.
- Rounds the final time to the nearest second.

Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or examples!
