[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, two times the default.**

Somebody has been grazing in Farmer John's $(1 \le G \le 10^5)$
private gardens! Using his expert forensic knowledge, FJ has been able to
determine the precise time each garden was grazed.  He has also determined that
there was a single cow that was responsible for every grazing incident.

In response to these crimes each of FJ's $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10^5)$
cows have provided an alibi that proves the cow was in a specific location at a
specific time.  Help FJ test whether each of these alibis demonstrates the cow's
innocence.

A cow can be determined to be innocent if it is impossible for her to have
travelled between all of the grazings and her alibi.  Cows travel at a rate of 1
unit distance per unit time.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input will contain $G$ and $N$ separated by a space.

The next $G$ lines contain the integers $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of the grazing.  It will always be possible for
a single cow to travel between all grazings.

The next $N$ lines contain $x$, $y$, and $t$
$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9; 0 \le t \le 10^9)$ separated by a space
describing the location and time of each cow's alibi.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer: the number of cows with alibis that prove their
innocence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
0 0 100
50 0 200
0 50 50
1000 1000 0
50 0 200
10 0 170
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2

There were two grazings; the first at $(0, 0)$ at time $100$ and the
second at $(50, 0)$ at time $200$.

The first cow's alibi does not prove her innocence.  She has just enough time to
arrive at the first grazing.

The second cow's alibi does prove her innocence.  She is nowhere near any of the
grazings.

Unfortunately for the third cow, being at the scene of the crime does not prove
innocence.

Finally, the fourth cow is innocent because it's impossible to make it from her
alibi to the final grazing in time.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: $1 \le G, N \le 10^3$. Also, for both the fields and alibis,
$-10^6 \le x, y \le 10^6$ and  $0 \le t \le 10^6$. Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T07:44:18] thinking

**Evaluating alibis for innocence**

I'm thinking about how to assess if a cow's alibi can coexist with its presence at all grazing events. To do this, I'll look at each alibi (given by coordinates
 and time) and see if it's possible for the cow to have visited every grazing event at the designated times. If a specific alibi can’t fit into that travel path
, it indicates the cow's innocence. So, counting those unfit alibis is key to determining guilt or innocence!
**Assessing grazing order**

I'm sorting the grazing events by time to figure out the minimal travel time needed for the cow to visit them all. I need to analyze if the alibi point can fit
within the timeline of grazing visits. The cow's itinerary is a sequence that has to include all grazing points and the alibi in order. I’ll check whether the a
libi can be placed before, between, or after the grazing events while respecting travel times between them. The travel distances must also align with the time g
aps!
**Implementing grazing count solution**

I'm aiming to create a program that reads input, processes it, and prints a count of innocent claims based on grazing events. I don't think I need a planning st
age since this is a straightforward task. I’ll break the code into sections: first, restating the problem, then presenting the solution idea, and finally drafti
ng the pseudocode before coding it all in solution.py. I’ll utilize a binary search method to determine if the alibi fits the grazing schedule. Everything seems
 ready to implement!

**Restatement**
Given a list of grazing events, each with a location and time, and a list of cow alibis (each also a location and time), count how many alibis are impossible to
 fit into the single cow’s path visiting all grazings at speed 1.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort all grazing events by time.
- For each alibi, locate where it would fall in the grazing timeline (before the first, between two, or after the last).
- Check Euclidean distance constraints to ensure the cow could move from the earlier event to the alibi and then to the later event within the available time in
tervals.
- If either leg is too far, the alibi cannot coincide with the crime path, proving innocence.

**Pseudocode**
```
read G, N
read list of (x,y,t) grazings
sort grazings by t
extract arrays times[], xs[], ys[]
innocent_count = 0
for each alibi (x0,y0,t0):
    idx = first grazing with time > t0
    if idx == 0:
        # alibi before all grazings
        check distance to grazing[0] <= time diff
    elif idx == G:
        # alibi after all grazings
        check distance from grazing[G-1] <= time diff
    else:
        # between grazings[idx-1] and grazings[idx]
        check both legs (prev→alibi and alibi→next)
    if any check fails:
        innocent_count += 1
print innocent_count
```

The full implementation is saved in `solution.py`.
