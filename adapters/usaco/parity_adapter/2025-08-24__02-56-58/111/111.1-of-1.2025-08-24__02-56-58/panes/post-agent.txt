[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Bovine Alliance [Mark Gordon, 2011]

Bessie and her bovine pals from nearby farms have finally decided that they
are going to start connecting their farms together by trails in an effort
to form an alliance against the farmers.  The cows in each of the N (1 <= N
<= 100,000) farms were initially instructed to build a trail to exactly one
other farm, for a total of N trails.  However months into the project only
M (1 <= M < N) of these trails had actually been built.

Arguments between the farms over which farms already built a trail now
threaten to split apart the cow alliance.  To ease tension, Bessie wishes
to calculate how many ways the M trails that exist so far could have been
built.  For example, if there is a trail connecting farms 3 and 4, then one
possibility is that farm 3 built the trail, and the other possibility is
that farm 4 built the trail.  Help Bessie by calculating the number of
different assignments of trails to the farms that built them, modulo
1,000,000,007.  Two assignments are considered different if there is at
least one trail built by a different farm in each assignment.

PROBLEM NAME: alliance

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers N and M

* Lines 2..1+M: Line i+1 describes the ith trail.  Each line contains
        two space-separated integers u_i and v_i (1 <= u_i, v_i <= N,
        u_i != v_i) describing the pair of farms connected by the
        trail.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 4
1 2
3 2
4 5
4 5

INPUT DETAILS:

Note that there can be two trails between the same pair of farms.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line containing the number of assignments of trails
        to farms, taken modulo 1,000,000,007.  If no assignment
        satisfies the above conditions output 0.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 possible assignments.  Letting {a,b,c,d} mean that farm 1
builds trail a, farm 2 builds trail b, farm 3 builds trail c, and farm 4
builds trail d, the assignments are:
{2, 3, 4, 5}
{2, 3, 5, 4}
{1, 3, 4, 5}
{1, 3, 5, 4}
{1, 2, 4, 5}
{1, 2, 5, 4}

[2025-08-24T07:22:21] thinking

**Analyzing trail assignments**

I'm reasoning through a scenario where each of the N farms was supposed to build a trail to only one other farm, resulting in N trails. However, only M farms ac
tually completed their trails, which means we have an interesting setup: M farms built one trail, while N-M built none. Each farm can only build a single trail,
 so now I need to figure out how to orient these edges properly, ensuring no farm builds more than one trail. Is there another factor to consider?
**Counting graph orientations**

I’m exploring a situation where not all farms have built trails yet, which isn’t my main focus. The key factor is the existing M edges and ensuring each endpoin
t can only have one outgoing trail. I need to calculate valid edge orientations while keeping the count mod 1e9+7. Given that N can reach up to 100k and M is le
ss than N, I'm considering the structure of the graph as components. Each component could have cycles, but I’m realizing that if M is less than N, then M - N +
C must always be non-negative.
**Evaluating component cycles**

I'm analyzing a situation with components in a graph where the total cycles can be expressed as M - N + C. Since M is less than N, I can see that this means the
re are no cycles present, resulting in a forest. I also find that the number of components, C, is at least N - M, and since there's a possibility of cycles, eac
h component needs careful consideration. For trees, I need to count edges where every node has one outgoing edge.

In a valid orientation, each edge must be assigned to one endpoint, maintaining limitations. If a component has more edges than nodes, it’s impossible to assign
 them, but this isn't an issue overall since M is less than N. However, I still need to ensure each individual component respects this edge-node relationship. I
f edges equal the nodes, I see that I can only have cycles if the component is exactly one cycle. This makes the orientation possibilities quite specific.
**Restating the problem**

I need to count the number of ways to assign edges in a graph with N nodes and M undirected edges, ensuring that each node can build at most one outgoing edge.
The count must be calculated under modulo \(1e9 + 7\).

**Conceptual solution**
The approach involves decomposing the graph into connected components. For each component, I will count the nodes and edges. If there are more edges than nodes,
 it's impossible; if edges equal nodes minus one, it’s a tree, and there are ways equal to the number of nodes. If edges equal nodes, there is exactly one cycle
, yielding two orientation possibilities.

**Pseudocode**
1. Parse N and M.
2. Build the adjacency list for the graph.
3. For each component, conduct a BFS to count nodes and edges.
4. Calculate the number of ways based on the conditions above.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python and save it as `solution.py`.

1. Problem restatement
- We have N farms (nodes) and M built undirected trails (edges), each built by exactly one endpoint. Each farm can build at most one trail so far. Count the num
ber of ways to assign each trail to one of its two endpoints (i.e., orient each edge) such that no farm builds more than one, modulo 1,000,000,007.

2. Conceptual solution
- Decompose the graph into connected components.
- In each component with nᵢ nodes and mᵢ edges:
  - If mᵢ > nᵢ, no valid orientation → answer is 0.
  - If mᵢ = nᵢ - 1 (a tree), there are nᵢ ways (choose which node has no outgoing).
  - If mᵢ = nᵢ (a single cycle with trees attached), there are 2 ways (two cycle directions).
- Multiply component counts modulo 1e9+7.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, M
build adjacency list adj[]
visited = [false]*N
result = 1
for each node i in 0..N-1:
    if not visited[i]:
        BFS from i to count node_count and sum of degrees degree_sum
        edge_count = degree_sum // 2
        if edge_count > node_count:
            print(0); exit
        if edge_count == node_count - 1:
            result *= node_count
        else if edge_count == node_count:
            result *= 2
        # else multiply by 1 (isolated node)
print(result % MOD)
```

4. Solution file created
- The complete Python 3 implementation is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py < input.txt`.
