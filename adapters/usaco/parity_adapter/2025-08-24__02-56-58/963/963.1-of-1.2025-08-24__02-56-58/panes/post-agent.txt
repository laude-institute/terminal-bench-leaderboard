[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In order to improve their physical fitness, the cows have taken up gymnastics!
Farmer John designates his favorite cow Bessie to coach the $N$ other cows and
to assess their progress as they learn various gymnastic skills.

In each of $K$ practice sessions ($1 \leq K \leq 10$), Bessie ranks the $N$ cows according to their
performance ($1 \leq N \leq 20$).  Afterward, she is curious about the consistency in these rankings.
A pair of two distinct cows is consistent if one cow did better than the
other one in every practice session.

Help Bessie compute the total number of consistent pairs.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains two positive integers $K$ and $N$. The next $K$ lines will each contain the
integers $1 \ldots N$ in some order, indicating the rankings of the cows (cows
are identified by the numbers $1 \ldots N$). If $A$ appears before $B$ in one of
these lines, that means cow $A$ did better than cow $B$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output, on a single line, the number of consistent pairs.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 4
4 1 2 3
4 1 3 2
4 2 1 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

The consistent pairs of cows are $(1,4)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(1,3)$.

**Understanding consistent pairs**

I'm examining a problem involving K ranking lists of N cows identified by their IDs. A pair (i, j) is considered consistent if cow i ranks above cow j in all se
ssions, meaning if A appears before B in every ranking, it's a consistent pair. So, to find the number of ordered pairs that satisfy this condition, I need to c
ount pairs like (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) from the example provided. However, it seems that cow 4 is always ranked first, making pairs like (4,1) inconsistent.
**Clarifying the ranking problem**

I've been analyzing an input case with rankings among cows, specifically checking which ones consistently rank above others. From the examples given, cow 4 is t
he highest in all sessions, making consistent pairs like (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). However, the pairs were listed in reverse order, which seems incorrect. I need
 to consider the unordered nature of these pairs. Now, I have four deliverables: restate the problem, describe the solution concept, write pseudocode, and save
it all in a solution file. I'm also wondering how to include pseudocode in the file correctly.

1. Restated problem
- We have K practice sessions ranking N cows by performance.
- A pair of cows is “consistent” if in every session the same cow outperforms the other.
- We need to count how many unordered pairs meet this criterion.

2. Conceptual solution
- Parse all K rankings and record each cow’s position in each session.
- For every pair of cows (i, j), check if i is always above j or j is always above i.
- Increment a counter for each pair that is consistent.

3. Pseudocode
```
Read integers K, N
Initialize positions[K][N+1]
For each session s in 0..K-1:
  Read the session’s N cow IDs in order
  For each rank index r in 0..N-1:
    positions[s][cow_id] = r

count = 0
For i from 1 to N-1:
  For j from i+1 to N:
    i_better = True
    j_better = True
    For each session s:
      If positions[s][i] < positions[s][j]:
        j_better = False
      Else:
        i_better = False
      If neither i_better nor j_better:
        Break
    If i_better or j_better:
      count += 1

Print count
```

I’ve created `solution.py` with the full Python implementation. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or make adjustments!
