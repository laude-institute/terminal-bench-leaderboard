[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Combination Lock [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's cows keep escaping from his farm and causing mischief. To try
and prevent them from leaving, he purchases a fancy combination lock to
keep his cows from opening the pasture gate.

Knowing that his cows are quite clever, Farmer John wants to make sure they
cannot easily open the lock by simply trying many different combinations.
The lock has three dials, each numbered 1..N (1 <= N <= 100), where 1 and N
are adjacent since the dials are circular.  There are two combinations that
open the lock, one set by Farmer John, and also a "master" combination set
by the lock maker.  The lock has a small tolerance for error, however, so
it will open even if the numbers on the dials are each within at most 2
positions of a valid combination.  For example, if Farmer John's
combination is (1,2,3) and the master combination is (4,5,6), the lock will
open if its dials are set to (1,N,5) (since this is close enough to Farmer
John's combination) or to (2,4,8) (since this is close enough to the master
combination).  Note that (1,5,6) would not open the lock, since it is not
close enough to any one single combination.

Given Farmer John's combination and the master combination, please
determine the number of distinct settings for the dials that will open the
lock.  Order matters, so the setting (1,2,3) is distinct from (3,2,1).

PROBLEM NAME: combo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Line 2: Three space-separated integers, specifying Farmer John's
        combination.

* Line 3: Three space-separated integers, specifying the master
        combination (possibly the same as Farmer John's combination).

SAMPLE INPUT:

50
1 2 3
5 6 7

INPUT DETAILS:

Each dial is numbered 1..50.  Farmer John's combination is (1,2,3), and the
master combination is (5,6,7).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of distinct dial settings that will open the
        lock.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

249

**Structuring the Python Solution**

The user wants a Python 3 solution saved as `solution.py`, which involves four steps: first, I need to restate the problem in simple terms. Then, I'll conceptua
lize the solution in plain English, followed by writing the pseudocode. Finally, I will implement the actual code. Since the tasks are straightforward, creating
 a detailed plan may not be necessary, but I'll ensure each step is clear and concise, focusing on the valid positions related to the three dials.
**Developing Unique Combinations**

I want to generate unique combinations within a defined tolerance for each dial, considering the values close to FJ and the master settings. The maximum possibl
e combinations would be calculated as min(N, 5) raised to the power of 3. The overlap must be managed since values counted for both FJ and master should not dou
ble count. I'll compute valid position ranges within two of each value for both settings, using a combinatorial approach for elegance. I'll implement simple loo
ps and utilize sets to generate and count valid combinations effectively.
**Preparing the Python Code**

I'm setting up the pseudocode for the solution: first, I’ll read the input. Then, I need to define a function to find neighbors. For each dial, I’ll generate ad
justed values with wrap-around using offsets from -2 to 2, collecting these in a tuple and returning a set. After that, I’ll compute the union of sets and print
 the length. I'll save this code in `solution.py`. Before that, I’ll let the user know I’m about to create the file and then confirm once it’s done.

I’ve created `solution.py` with the full Python 3 implementation:

- Reads input from stdin
- Computes all dial settings within 2 positions of either combination using wrap-around arithmetic
- Outputs the count of unique valid settings

Let me know if you’d like to run tests or see sample I/O!
