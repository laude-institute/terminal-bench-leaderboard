Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nFarmer John has received a shipment of $N$ large hay bales ($1 \\le N \\le 4000$)\nand placed them at various locations along the road leading to his barn.\nUnfortunately, he completely forgets that Bessie the cow is out grazing along\nthe road, and she may now be trapped within the bales!\nEach bale $j$ has a size $S_j$ and a distinct position $P_j$ giving its location\nalong the one-dimensional road.  Bessie the cow starts at some location where\nthere is no hay bale, and can move around freely along the road, even up to the\nposition at which a bale is located, but she cannot cross through this position.\nAs an exception, if she runs in the same direction for $D$ units of distance,\nshe builds up enough speed to break through and permanently eliminate any hay\nbale of size strictly less than $D$.  Of course, after doing this, she\nmight open up more space to allow her to make a run at other hay bales,\neliminating them as well.  \nBessie can escape to freedom if she can eventually break through either the \nleftmost or rightmost hay bale.  Please compute the total area of the road\nconsisting of real-valued starting positions from which Bessie cannot escape.\nFor example, if Bessie cannot escape if she starts between hay bales at \npositions 1 and 5, then these encompass an area of size 4 from which she  cannot\nescape.\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe first line of input contains $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines describes a\nbale, and contains two integers giving its size and position, each in the range\n$1\\ldots 10^9$.  \n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nPrint a single integer, giving the area of the road from which Bessie cannot\nescape.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:5\n8 1\n1 4\n8 8\n7 15\n4 20\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: 14\n\n[Problem credits: Brian Dean, 2015]\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
