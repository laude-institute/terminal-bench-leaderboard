[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has received a shipment of $N$ large hay bales ($1 \le N \le 4000$)
and placed them at various locations along the road leading to his barn.
Unfortunately, he completely forgets that Bessie the cow is out grazing along
the road, and she may now be trapped within the bales!
Each bale $j$ has a size $S_j$ and a distinct position $P_j$ giving its location
along the one-dimensional road.  Bessie the cow starts at some location where
there is no hay bale, and can move around freely along the road, even up to the
position at which a bale is located, but she cannot cross through this position.
As an exception, if she runs in the same direction for $D$ units of distance,
she builds up enough speed to break through and permanently eliminate any hay
bale of size strictly less than $D$.  Of course, after doing this, she
might open up more space to allow her to make a run at other hay bales,
eliminating them as well.
Bessie can escape to freedom if she can eventually break through either the
leftmost or rightmost hay bale.  Please compute the total area of the road
consisting of real-valued starting positions from which Bessie cannot escape.
For example, if Bessie cannot escape if she starts between hay bales at
positions 1 and 5, then these encompass an area of size 4 from which she  cannot
escape.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines describes a
bale, and contains two integers giving its size and position, each in the range
$1\ldots 10^9$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single integer, giving the area of the road from which Bessie cannot
escape.

SAMPLE INPUT:5
8 1
1 4
8 8
7 15
4 20
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 14

**Streamlining trapped positions**

I'm focusing on how to determine total "trapped" positions between bales. Starting positions are in the union of all trapped intervals, but overlapping must be
addressed. Instead of detailing all intervals, I can generate disjoint intervals for trapping pairs and subtract bale positions. However, calculating the union
of O(N^2) intervals isn't efficient. The two-pointer method seems better: using pointers to quickly find minimal trap intervals while evaluating if bales can be
 broken based on their positions and lengths.
**Refining the trapping algorithm**

I'm working on finding trapped intervals between bales using a two-pointer approach. When neither condition holds, such as if the distance between pointers is l
ess than or equal to specific sizes, I need to record those intervals. I can see from the sample data that sorting the positions helps a lot. During the travers
al, I'll adjust the pointers while checking for valid trapping pairs. It seems I must consider inner traps as well, iterating through every left boundary and co
nfirming valid pairs to generate minimal overlapping intervals. Juggling all these cases is quite a task!
**Implementing interval collection**

I'm outlining a process to record trapped intervals based on distances calculated between bales using a nested loop approach. The worst-case scenario is O(N^2),
 which translates to a lot of steps for large inputs. Once I gather these intervals, I'll sort and merge them, taking care to ensure endpoints are treated corre
ctly to avoid counting bale positions. I'll draft plain English steps, create pseudocode, and then implement the actual code in `solution.py`. After coding, I’l
l apply the patch and save it to ensure everything works smoothly. Let’s get started!

I’ve implemented the solution in `solution.py`, which:

- Reads and sorts the bales by position.
- For each left bale, scans from the right end to find any trapping partner.
- Collects all trapped intervals, merges them, and sums their lengths.
- Prints the total trapped length.

Let me know if you’d like me to add tests or explain any part!
