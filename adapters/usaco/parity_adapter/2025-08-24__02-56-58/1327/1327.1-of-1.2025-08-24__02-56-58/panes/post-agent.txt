[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem in Python is 15s.  Other languages have the default time limit of 2s.**
Each of Farmer John's $N$ barns ($2\le N\le 10^5$) has selected a team of $C$
cows ($1\le C\le 18$) to participate in field day. The breed of every cow is
either a Guernsey or a Holstein.

The difference between two teams is defined to be the number of positions $i$
($1 \leq i \leq C$) at which the breeds of the cows in the $i$th positions
differ. For every team $t$ from $1 \ldots N$, please compute the maximum
difference between team $t$ and any other team.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $C$ and $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of length $C$ of Gs and Hs.  Each line
corresponds to a team.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each team, print the maximum difference.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3
GHGGH
GHHHH
HGHHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
5
3
5

The first and third teams differ by $5$. The second and third teams differ by
$3$.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-5: $C = 10$Inputs 6-9: All answers are at least $C-3$.
 Inputs 10-20: No additional constraints.

**Maximizing distance in bitmasking**

I want to determine the maximum distance among strings based on bitmasks. This involves minimizing matching bits between 0/1 bits. My goal is to find a string \
( t \) that maximizes the Hamming distance from \( s \). This means minimizing the number of same positions while maximizing the bitwise XOR popcount. I'll repr
esent the strings as bitmasks with \( C \) bits, treating \( G \) as 0 and \( H \) as 1. For each mask \( s \), I need to account for duplicates in the set \( S
 \).
**Optimizing mask selection**

For each mask \( s \), I want a different mask \( t \). If duplicates exist, it still gives a distance of 0. The goal is to find a mask that maximizes popcount
for \( s \) XOR \( t \). Since \( C \) is small, I can check masks by their Hamming distance. The ideal complementary mask could give a distance of \( C \), but
 if it's not in the set, I'll look for smaller distances. Testing efficiently is key; if there are many strings, I need to avoid checking too many combinations.
**Finding the max Hamming distance**

I need to create a data structure to calculate the maximum XOR or Hamming distance between masks. While maximizing the integer XOR value isn’t the same as maxim
izing the popcount, I want to focus on maximizing the Hamming distance. Given that \( C \) is small, I can precompute the farthest present masks for Hamming dis
tance.

A potential method is to perform a nearest neighbor search in the Hamming space using BFS to find the closest mask to the complement effectively. I'll explore s
trategies to ensure I handle duplicates properly.

I’ve added `solution.py` implementing a BFS over the C-dimensional hypercube to compute each team’s farthest Hamming distance in O(2^C·C + N) time. Let me know
if you’d like me to run any tests or walk through the approach in more detail!

+Compute, for each team of cows represented as G/H strings of length C,

+Uses BFS on the C-dimensional hypercube to find for each bitmask the
