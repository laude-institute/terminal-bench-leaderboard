[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  does
find the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.

She is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.
The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \leq N
\leq 248$), each in the range $1 \ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessie can
take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a single
number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two adjacent 7s
with an 8).  The goal is to maximize the value of the largest number
present in the sequence at the end of the game.  Please help Bessie
score as highly as possible!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the next $N$ lines give the sequence
of $N$ numbers at the start of the game.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1
1
1
2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to
obtain the sequence 1 2 2, and then she merges the 2s into a 3.  Note that it is
not optimal  to join the first two 1s.

[2025-08-24T07:38:04] thinking

**Exploring number merging**

I'm looking at a problem involving a sequence of integers where adjacent equal values can merge, creating a new value. The goal is to maximize the largest numbe
r left in the sequence after all possible merges. This resembles the "248" USACO challenge. I need to set up a dynamic programming approach to compute the maxim
um value for each interval, making sure I handle merges correctly. It'll be interesting to see how high I can get the final value!
**Clarifying the maximum value**

I'm working through how to determine the maximum number generated after merging integers in a sequence. The DP approach computes for full compressed segments, b
ut I need to focus on the largest integer across all intervals. The answer will be the maximum of all possible merged values. I considered cases where segments
interleave as well, which complicates things a bit. However, since I know the constraints, I’m confident in using a cubic DP solution, and I’ll set up the imple
mentation next!

Here’s the implementation saved as **solution.py**.

1. Restated: Bessie repeatedly merges two equal adjacent numbers x into x+1; maximize the largest number reachable.
2. Conceptual solution: Use interval DP where dp[i][j] stores the merged value if subarray [i..j] can compress fully, else 0. Build dp by increasing interval le
ngth, checking splits.
3. Pseudocode:
   - Read N and array a.
   - Initialize dp[i][i] = a[i].
   - For each length L=2..N:
     - For each start i: j = i+L-1
       - For split k=i..j-1:
         - If dp[i][k] == dp[k+1][j] != 0, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k]+1)
   - Answer = max(dp[i][j]) over all i,j; print it.

Let me know if you’d like me to run tests or anything else!
