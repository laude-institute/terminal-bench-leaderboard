[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Mooo Moo [silver] [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John has completely forgotten how many cows he owns!  He is too
embarrassed to go to his fields to count the cows, since he doesn't want
the cows to realize his mental lapse.  Instead, he decides to count his
cows secretly by planting microphones in the fields in which his cows tend
to gather, figuring that he can determine the number of cows from the total
volume of all the mooing he hears.

FJ's N fields (1 <= N <= 100) are all arranged in a line along a long
straight road.  Each field might contain several types of cows; FJ
owns cows that come from B different breeds (1 <= B <= 20), and a cow
of breed i moos at a volume of V(i) (1 <= V(i) <= 100).  Moreover,
there is a strong wind blowing down the road, which carries the sound
of mooing in one direction from left to right: if the volume of mooing
in some field is X, then in the next field this will contribute X-1 to
the total mooing volume (and X-2 in the field after that, etc.).
Otherwise stated, the mooing volume in a field is the sum of the
contribution due to cows in that field, plus X-1, where X is the total
mooing volume in the preceding field.

Given the volume of mooing that FJ records in each field, please compute
the minimum possible number of cows FJ might own.

The volume FJ records in any field is at most 100,000.

PROBLEM NAME: mooomoo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integers N and B.

* Lines 2..1+B: Line i+1 contains the integer V(i).

* Lines 2+B..1+B+N: Line 1+B+i contains the total volume of all mooing
        in field i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 2
5
7
0
17
16
20
19

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ owns 5 fields, with mooing volumes 0,17,16,20,19.  There are two breeds
of cows; the first moos at a volume of 5, and the other at a volume of 7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows owned by FJ, or -1 if there is no
        configuration of cows consistent with the input.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 2 cows of breed #1 and 1 cow of breed #2 in field 2, and there is
another cow of breed #1 in field 4.

**Analyzing cow volume distribution**

I'm deducing that A[i] is given by M[i] minus the maximum of (M[i-1] - 1) or 0. We need A[i] to be a non-negative integer that can be represented as the sum of
cows' volumes. Our goal is to minimize the number of cows across each field, as their volume contributions don’t mix. This boils down to a coin change problem.
With constraints on volume and counts, the worst-case computational cost is quite high, around 200 million operations, which seems excessive. However, total A s
ums across fields are less than or equal to 100k.
**Planning the solution**

I'm realizing that each A[i] could be small or even zero, but worst-case M is always high—like M = [100k, 100k,...]. This means A[1] could be large early on, so
 I think a dynamic programming approach for each up to 100k could work with the smaller B.

I’ll do a coin change algorithm once for the larger A values. If any A[i] is negative, that would be invalid, so I’ll handle those cases too. The overall plan i
ncludes computing contributions, implementing the unbounded knapsack logic, and ultimately writing the code for solution.py, making sure to handle inputs proper
ly without extra libraries. Let's get started on that!
**Reviewing code implementation**

I’m looking at the code and it seems solid. It reads input, processes the number of fields and their contributions correctly, and builds the A array. Each contr
ibution is calculated, and if any A[i] is negative, it exits with -1, which is great. The dynamic programming section initializes the dp array and efficiently f
ills it based on the volume values.

After checking, the overall logic aligns with my plan. Now I’m ready to proceed with the next steps, confident in this implementation.

Here’s your complete solution:

**1. Restatement**
We have \(N\) fields in a row, each recording a total moo volume \(M[i]\). Cows of \(B\) breeds contribute intrinsic volumes \(V[j]\). Wind carries moo from fie
ld \(i\) to \(i+1\) reducing its volume by 1 each step. Given all \(M[i]\), find the minimum number of cows (across all fields) whose intrinsic moos sum (plus c
arried contributions) match the recordings exactly, or report \(-1\) if impossible.

**2. Conceptual Solution**
- For each field \(i\), compute the “intrinsic” volume \(A[i] = M[i] - \max(M[i-1] - 1, 0)\).
- If any \(A[i] < 0\), it’s inconsistent.
- Now each \(A[i]\) must be formed by summing breed volumes \(V\) (unlimited copies) with the fewest cows—classic unbounded coin-change.
- Precompute a DP array up to \(\max A[i]\) once, then sum the minimal coin counts for each \(A[i]\).
- If any \(A[i]\) is unreachable, output \(-1\), else the total count.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N, B
read list V of size B
read list M of size N

A = empty list
prev = 0
for each m in M:
    carry = prev - 1 if prev > 0 else 0
    a = m - carry
    if a < 0: print(-1); exit
    append a to A
    prev = m

maxA = max(A)
initialize dp[0..maxA] = INF, dp[0] = 0
for each volume v in V:
    for x from v to maxA:
        dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x-v] + 1)

total = 0
for a in A:
    if dp[a] == INF: print(-1); exit
    total += dp[a]

print(total)
```
