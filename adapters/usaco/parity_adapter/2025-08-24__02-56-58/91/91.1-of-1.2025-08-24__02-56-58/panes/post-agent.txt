[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Above the Median [Brian Dean]

Farmer John has lined up his N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows in a row to measure
their heights; cow i has height H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000,000,000)
nanometers--FJ believes in precise measurements! He wants to take a picture
of some contiguous subsequence of the cows to submit to a bovine
photography contest at the county fair.

The fair has a very strange rule about all submitted photos: a photograph
is only valid to submit if it depicts a group of cows whose median height
is at least a certain threshold X (1 <= X <= 1,000,000,000).

For purposes of this problem, we define the median of an array A[0...K] to
be A[ceiling(K/2)] after A is sorted, where ceiling(K/2) gives K/2 rounded
up to the nearest integer (or K/2 itself, it K/2 is an integer to begin
with). For example the median of {7, 3, 2, 6} is 6, and the median of {5,
4, 8} is 5.

Please help FJ count the number of different contiguous subsequences of his
cows that he could potentially submit to the photography contest.

PROBLEM NAME: median

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and X.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer H_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 6
10
5
6
2

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's four cows have heights 10, 5, 6, 2. We want to know how many
contiguous subsequences have median at least 6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of subsequences of FJ's cows that have median at
        least X. Note this may not fit into a 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 possible contiguous subsequences to consider. Of these, only 7
have median at least 6. They are {10}, {6}, {10, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 2}, {10,
5, 6}, {10, 5, 6, 2}.

[2025-08-24T07:59:48] thinking

**Testing median and counts**

I'm figuring out a condition for the number of good versus bad elements and how that relates to finding a median. For a sorted list of length 4, the median is t
he second smallest element, so to have it ≥ X, at least three elements need to be ≥ X. However, it seems that allows for at most one element to be less than X.
I’m wondering if the general rule holds that the count of good elements should be at least one more than the count of bad elements.
**Reevaluating median conditions**

I’m analyzing how to find the median in a sequence and whether the number of good elements is sufficient. For a length of 2, I see that the median is the second
 element, which can be the larger number when sorted. This leads me to realize that for an even length, the median is the upper one. To ensure the median is at
least X, we need at least half the elements to meet or exceed X. So, I conclude that the count of good elements should be at least half of the total length.
**Counting subarrays with median conditions**

I'm grappling with how to determine the number of subarrays that have a median ≥ X based on counting good versus bad elements. For odd lengths, I see that count
_good should be greater than or equal to half, while for even lengths, it should be at least equal. The prefix sum method helps organize transformed values, dif
ferentiating between elements above and below X. But I want to ensure I account for both odd and even length windows correctly, which seems tricky. Using two st
ructures to partition based on length parity might streamline this approach.
**Planning the solution steps**

I’m developing a solution using two BITs for prefix sum counts, one for even and one for odd indexed elements. As I iterate through the elements, I keep track o
f the parity and calculate the necessary counts based on previous sums. I realize I need to articulate the entire problem clearly, conceptualize the solution, w
rite out pseudocode, and then create the Python file for implementation. I’ll proceed to generate the code in a way that handles inputs effectively, avoiding an
y extra complexity.

Here’s a Python 3 implementation that runs in O(N log N) time using two Fenwick trees to handle even/odd lengths. It reads from stdin and writes the answer to s
tdout in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like tests or further explanation!
