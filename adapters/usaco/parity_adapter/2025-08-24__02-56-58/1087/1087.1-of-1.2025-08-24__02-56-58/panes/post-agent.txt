[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie has recently received a painting set, and she wants to paint the long
fence at one end of her pasture.  The fence consists of $N$ consecutive 1-meter
segments ($1\le N\le 10^5$).  Bessie has 26 different colors available, which
she labels with the letters 'A' through 'Z' in increasing order of darkness ('A'
is a very light color, and 'Z' is very dark).  She can therefore describe the
desired color she wants to paint each fence segment as a length-$N$ string where
each character is a letter.

Initially, all fence segments are uncolored.  Bessie can color any  contiguous
range of segments with a single color in a single brush stroke as long as she
never paints a lighter color over a darker color (she can only paint darker
colors over lighter colors).

For example, an initially uncolored segment of length four can be colored as
follows:


.... -> BBB. -> BBLL -> BQQL

Running short on time, Bessie thinks she may need to leave some consecutive
range of fence segments unpainted! Currently, she is considering $Q$  candidate
ranges ($1\le Q\le 10^5$), each described by  by two integers $(a,b)$ with
$1 \leq a \leq b \leq N$ giving the indices of  endpoints of the range
$a \ldots b$ of segments to be left unpainted.

For each candidate range, what is the minimum number of strokes needed to paint
every fence segment outside those in the range with its desired color while
leaving all fence segments inside the range uncolored?  Note that Bessie does
not actually do any painting during this process, so the answers for each
candidate range are independent.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $Q$.

The next line contains a string of length $N$ characters representing the
desired color  for each fence segment.

The next $Q$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$
representing a candidate range to possibly leave unpainted.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each of the $Q$ candidates, output the answer on a new line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
8 2
ABBAABCB
3 6
1 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
3

In this example, excluding the sub-range corresponding to the desired pattern
$\texttt{BAAB}$ requires four strokes to paint while excluding $\texttt{ABBA}$
requires only three.


.... -> AA.. -> ABBB -> ABCB

SCORING:
Test cases 1-4 satisfy $N,Q\le 100$.Test cases 5-7 satisfy
$N,Q\le 5000$.Test cases 8-13 satisfy no additional constraints.

[2025-08-24T08:03:58] thinking

**Considering painting constraints**

I’m exploring the constraint of painting with monotonic color, where a lighter color can't be painted over a darker one, which matches how printers work. It see
ms that I can only paint from lighter to darker within segments, so I’m thinking about how to calculate strokes. This problem can be simplified to counting the
minimum strokes needed for contiguous elements using dynamic programming. The key idea is that the minimum number of strokes equals the number of segments plus
the number of color increases. There's a known solution for that!
**Exploring painting strokes**

I’m thinking about how the painter can't use lighter colors over darker ones when creating a specific pattern like A B B A A B C B. To achieve this without gaps
, it requires a clever approach using dynamic programming. The key is to count segments where colors appear without overlap. I realize that strokes start at one
 due to the initial white. I’ll track increases in the string, counting strokes for cases where the color level rises.

For the sample string, I found that four strokes are necessary. Overall, it feels like a manageable problem focused on counting color transitions accurately!
**Reevaluating stroke count**

I’m reconsidering the stroke count for painting segments and noticed my initial calculation might be off. For segments like AB and CB, it looks like I need to a
ccount for how segments reset when starting a new color. Painting must allow for separate strokes when transitioning colors. So for segment AB, I have 2 strokes
, and for segment CB, there are also 2 strokes, leading to a total of 4. I need to derive a formula to identify when to start a new stroke based on color increa
ses relative to previous colors. It’s a complex puzzle to solve!

1. Problem restated
Bessie must paint a fence of N segments to match a given target color string. She can paint any contiguous stretch in one stroke with a single color, but only d
arker colors over lighter. For each of Q queries asking to leave segments [a…b] unpainted, compute the minimum strokes needed to paint the rest independently fo
r each query.

2. Conceptual solution
- The optimal painting cost for any contiguous block is found by scanning its colors left to right, using a stack: pop darker colors when current is lighter, an
d push (increment stroke count) when current is darker than stack top.
- Precompute prefix strokes f[i] = cost to paint s[1..i], and suffix strokes g[i] = cost to paint s[i..N].
- For a query [a,b], the answer is f[a-1] + g[b+1].

3. Pseudocode
```
function compute_strokes(s):
  strokes[0]=0; stack=[], cnt=0
  for i from 1 to len(s):
    oc = ord(s[i])
    while stack not empty and stack.top > oc:
      stack.pop()
    if stack empty or stack.top < oc:
      stack.push(oc); cnt += 1
    strokes[i] = cnt
  return strokes

read N, Q, S
f = compute_strokes(S)
g_rev = compute_strokes(reverse(S))
construct g so g[i] = g_rev[N-i+1], g[N+1]=0

for each query a,b:
  print f[a-1] + g[b+1]
```
