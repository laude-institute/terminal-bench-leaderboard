[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Fair Photography [Brian Dean, 2014]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are standing at various positions along
a long one-dimensional fence.  The ith cow is standing at position x_i (an
integer in the range 0...1,000,000,000) and has breed b_i (either 'G' for
Guernsey or 'H' for Holstein).  No two cows occupy the same position.

FJ wants to take a photo of a contiguous interval of cows for the county
fair, but we wants all of his breeds to be fairly represented in the photo.
Therefore, he wants to ensure that, for whatever breeds are present in the
photo, there is an equal number of each breed (for example, a photo with
all Holsteins is ok, a photo with 27 Holsteins and 27 Guernseys is ok, but a
photo with 10 Holsteins and 9 Guernseys is not ok).  Help FJ take his fair
photo by finding the maximum size of a photo that satisfies FJ's
constraints.  The size of a photo is the difference between the maximum and
minimum positions of the cows in the photo.  It is possible that FJ could
end up taking a photo of just a single cow, in which case this photo would
have size zero.

PROBLEM NAME: fairphoto

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains x_i and b_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
4 G
10 H
7 G
16 G
1 G
3 H

INPUT DETAILS:

There are six cows with breeds (from left to right) G, H, G, G, H, G.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum size of a fair
        photo.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The largest fair photo Farmer John can take is of the middle 4 cows,
containing 2 Holsteins and 2 Guernseys.

**Maximizing cow segments**

I'm analyzing the segments that can contain only G cows, only H cows, or an equal number of each. The largest segment distance might come from positions of cows
 of the same breed. For segments consisting entirely of G, I need to identify the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum positions. But if there's an
H included, I'll have to ensure that the counts of G and H are equal. Thus, I have two cases to consider for accurate results.
**Identifying pure segments**

I'm considering pure segments that consist of only one breed, meaning no H cows at all. These segments are continuous intervals of positions without H. I’ll fin
d the largest gaps between consecutive H positions, essentially looking for the maximum lengths where only G cows exist. While I track runs of identical breeds,
 I'll calculate segment lengths from the first to the last position. The goal is to maximize the segments, focusing on both all G without H and all H without G.
 Finally, I’ll use a mapping method for equal numbers of G and H.

**Problem Restatement**
- We have N cows on a line, each at a unique integer position with breed G or H.
- We want a contiguous group of cows whose photo width (max pos – min pos) is as large as possible, under the rule that among the breeds present in the photo, e
ach breed appears equally often (or only one breed appears).

**Solution Outline**
- Sort cows by position.
- Case A (single‐breed runs): scan for longest contiguous subsequence of identical breed and record its span.
- Case B (equal‐count runs): assign G→+1, H→–1, compute running sum (“diff”), and for each diff value remember the earliest position where a segment could start
. When the same diff reappears, the cows between have equal G and H; update max span.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read list of (position, breed) pairs
sort pairs by position
extract positions[] and breeds[]

best = 0

# Single-breed runs
run_start = positions[0]
run_breed = breeds[0]
for i in 1..N-1:
    if breeds[i] != run_breed:
        best = max(best, positions[i-1] - run_start)
        run_start = positions[i]
        run_breed = breeds[i]
best = max(best, positions[N-1] - run_start)

# Equal-count runs via prefix diff
first_pos = {0: positions[0]}
diff = 0
for i in 0..N-1:
    diff += (1 if breeds[i]=='G' else -1)
    if diff in first_pos:
        best = max(best, positions[i] - first_pos[diff])
    else if i+1 < N:
        first_pos[diff] = positions[i+1]

print(best)
```
