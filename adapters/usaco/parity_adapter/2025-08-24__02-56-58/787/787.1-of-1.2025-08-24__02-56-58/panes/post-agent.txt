[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John realizes that the income he receives from milk production is
insufficient to fund the growth of his farm, so to earn some extra money, he
launches a cow-rental service, which he calls "USACOW" (pronounced "Use-a-cow").

Farmer John has $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), each capable of producing
some amount of milk every day.  The $M$ stores near FJ's farm
($1 \leq M \leq 100,000$) each offer to buy a certain amount of milk at a
certain price.  Moreover, Farmer John's $R$ ($1 \leq R \leq 100,000$)
neighboring farmers are each interested in renting a cow at a certain price.

Farmer John has to choose whether each cow should be milked or rented to a
nearby farmer.  Help him find the maximum amount of money he can make per day.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line in the input contains $N$, $M$, and $R$. The next $N$ lines each
contain an integer $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 1,000,000$),  indicating that Farmer
John's $i$th cow can produce $c_i$ gallons of milk every day. The next $M$ lines
each contain two integers $q_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \leq q_i, p_i \leq 1,000,000$),
indicating that the $i$th store is willing to buy up to $q_i$ gallons of milk
for $p_i$ cents per gallon.  Keep in mind that Farmer John can sell any amount
of milk between zero and $q_i$ gallons to a given store. The next $R$ lines each
contain an integer $r_i$ ($1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000$), indicating that one of
Farmer John's neighbors wants to rent a cow for $r_i$ cents per day.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of one line containing the maximum profit Farmer John
can make per day by milking or renting out each of his cows.  Note that the
output might be too large to fit into a standard 32-bit integer, so you may need
to use a larger integer type like a "long long" in C/C++.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
6
2
4
7
1
10 25
2 10
15 15
250
80
100
40
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
725

Farmer John should milk cows #1 and #4, to produce 13 gallons of milk.  He
should completely fill the order for 10 gallons, earning 250 cents, and sell the
remaining three gallons at 15 cents each, for a total of 295 cents of milk
profits.

Then, he should rent out the other three cows for 250, 80, and 100 cents, to
earn 430 more cents.  (He should leave the request for a 40-cent rental
unfilled.)  This is a total of 725 cents of daily profit.

**Implementing USACOW Problem**

I need to tackle the USACOW problem. First, I’ll restate it in plain English: it's about optimizing revenue from cows by balancing milk production and rental op
tions.

The solution involves sorting cows by milk output and rentals, creating prefix sums to compute potential revenues. I’ll write pseudocode before saving it as a P
ython script, ensuring I stay within constraints. My focus will be on maximizing milk yields and rental profits, either by sorting cows in descending or ascendi
ng order. Let’s refine this!
**Calculating Revenue for USACOW**

To maximize rental revenue, I need to rent out the lowest producing cows since rentals are fixed regardless of milk yield. So, I’ll sort the cows by production
in ascending order.

Next, I'll consider renting k cows, where k is from 0 to the smaller of N or R, and calculate the rental revenue based on the top k rental prices. The remaining
 cows will then be used for milking, and I must sort the stores by price for efficient milk sales, considering capacities.

I’ll also precompute prefix sums for store capacities and revenues, and then calculate total revenues iteratively for each k value to find the maximum overall r
evenue. Let’s get to it!

**Restatement**
Farmer John has N cows producing different amounts of milk. He can either sell their milk to M stores (each store buys up to a limit at a given price per gallon
) or rent cows to R neighbors for fixed daily fees. Decide which cows to milk vs. rent to maximize total daily earnings.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Rent the lowest-yielding cows (to earn fixed rates) and milk the highest-yielding ones.
- Sort cow yields ascending, rental offers descending, and store offers by price descending.
- Precompute prefix sums of cow yields and rental incomes.
- Precompute cumulative store capacities and revenues to quickly calculate income for any total milk amount via binary search.
- For k from 0 to N rented cows:
  - Rental income = sum of top k rentals.
  - Milk income = revenue by selling sum of remaining cows’ milk to stores.
  - Track the maximum total.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M, R
read list cows (size N)
read list stores as (quantity, price) pairs
read list rentals (size R)

sort cows ascending
compute cow_ps prefix sums
total_milk = cow_ps[N]

sort rentals descending
compute rent_ps prefix sums up to N entries (pad with zeros)

sort stores by price descending
build store_qty_ps and store_rev_ps prefix sums
store prices array

define milk_revenue(milk):
    if milk <= 0: return 0
    idx = bisect_right(store_qty_ps, milk)
    if idx == 0:
        return milk * prices[0]
    if idx >= M:
        return store_rev_ps[-1]
    return store_rev_ps[idx-1] + (milk - store_qty_ps[idx-1]) * prices[idx]

answer = 0
for k in 0..N:
    rent_income = rent_ps[k]
    milk_amount = total_milk - cow_ps[k]
    milk_income = milk_revenue(milk_amount)
    answer = max(answer, rent_income + milk_income)

print(answer)
```
