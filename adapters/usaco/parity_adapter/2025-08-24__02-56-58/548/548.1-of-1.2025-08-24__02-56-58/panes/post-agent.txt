[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's farm is in the shape of an $N \times N$ grid of fields ($2 \le N \le 18$),
each labeled with a letter in the alphabet.  For example:

ABCD
BXZX
CDXB
WCBA

Each day, Bessie the cow walks from the upper-left field to the lower-right
field, each step taking her either one field to the right or one field downward.
Bessie keeps track of the string that she generates during this process, built
from the letters she walks across.  She gets very disoriented, however, if this
string is a palindrome (reading the same forward as backward), since she gets
confused about which direction she had walked.
Please help Bessie determine the number of different palindromes she can form
during her walk.  Different ways of forming the same palindrome only count once;
for example, there are several routes that yield the palindrome ABXZXBA above,
but there are only four distinct palindromes Bessie can form, ABCDCBA, ABCWCBA,
ABXZXBA, ABXDXBA.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$, and the remaining $N$ lines contain the $N$ rows
of the grid of fields.  Each row contains $N$ characters that are in the range
A..Z.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the number of distinct palindromes Bessie can form.

SAMPLE INPUT:4
ABCD
BXZX
CDXB
WCBA
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 4

**Conceptualizing palindrome paths**

The user wants a solution to count unique palindromic strings created from paths in an N x N grid, starting from the top-left corner and ending at the bottom-ri
ght. Each path can go right or down, and the resulting strings must be palindromic, meaning they read the same backward and forward.

To solve this, I’ll clarify the task, think through the solution, write pseudocode, and save the final code, focusing on efficient handling due to the large num
ber of potential paths. I might explore dynamic programming or DFS to generate palindromic strings.
**Refining palindrome logic**

For a string to be a palindrome along the path, the character at each step must match its corresponding character from the end. I see that I can visualize this
with two pointers: one starting at the top-left (0,0) and the other at the bottom-right (N-1,N-1). After N-1 steps, they will meet, allowing me to track positio
ns.

When constructing a palindrome, I need to concatenate the prefix of the first half of the string with the reverse of this prefix. Since the full path has a leng
th of 2N-1, I will have an odd-length string with a middle character that logically resides at the meeting point. This means that the middle character will only
 appear once, merging as they reach the same cell.
I'm trying to figure out how to ensure valid palindromes, meaning positions need to match corresponding characters as I navigate the path. Instead of focusing s
olely on counting paths, I think a better way is to use depth-first search (DFS) from both ends to capture half-strings and combine them. However, I realize the
 number of paths can grow quite large, especially at N=18, leading to billions of combinations.

I need to rethink this: perhaps generating maps of prefix strings from the start and suffix strings from the end could be more manageable, focusing on matching
pairs. Still, I have to be careful about memory usage because the number of prefix strings could explode. I also consider using rolling hashes for better effici
ency, but the complexity of pairing positions remains a concern.
**Conceptualizing the solution**

I need to create a code solution to count distinct palindromic strings using paths in an N x N grid. I'll first restate the task in English, then explain my con
ceptual approach, write pseudocode, and finally save everything in a file named solution.py.

The main steps include reading the grid dimensions and values, traversing the grid to generate prefix and suffix strings through depth-first search (DFS), and t
hen finding the intersection of these sets to count distinct palindromes. I’ll ensure that I efficiently handle overlap and avoid duplicates with the use of set
s.

Finally, I'll structure the code properly, implementing the necessary functions and using the correct input format.

**Problem Restatement**
Given an \(N\times N\) grid of letters (\(2\le N\le18\)), Bessie walks from the top-left to the bottom-right by moving only right or down. This trace yields a s
tring of length \(2N-1\). We must count how many *distinct* palindromic strings can arise from any such path.

**Solution Concept**
Use a meet-in-the-middle on the path:

- After \(N\!-\!1\) moves (half the total steps), you land on one of the cells \((r,c)\) with \(r+c=N-1\). There are \(2^{N-1}\) such “prefix” paths. Record for
 each middle cell the set of strings of length \(N\) generated from \((0,0)\) to \((r,c)\).
- Similarly walk *backwards* from \((N-1,N-1)\) for \(N-1\) moves (only up or left), recording for each middle cell the set of *reversed* suffix-strings of leng
th \(N\).
- Any palindrome corresponds to a prefix string that exactly equals a reversed suffix at the same middle cell. Collect these matches across all middle cells, de
duplicate, and count.

This runs in \(O(2^{N-1}\times N)\) time and uses \(O(2^{N-1}\times N)\) memory, which for \(N\le18\) (\(\sim 130\)K half-paths) is efficient.

**Pseudocode**
```
Read N and grid[N][N]
prefix_map = dict: (r,c) -> set of prefix-strings
suffix_map = dict: (r,c) -> set of reversed suffix-strings

# DFS from start
dfs_prefix(r=0, c=0, steps=0, s=grid[0][0]):
    if steps == N-1:
        add s to prefix_map[(r,c)]
        return
    if r+1 < N: dfs_prefix(r+1, c, steps+1, s + grid[r+1][c])
    if c+1 < N: dfs_prefix(r, c+1, steps+1, s + grid[r][c+1])

# DFS from end (record reversed string)
dfs_suffix(r=N-1, c=N-1, steps=0, s=grid[N-1][N-1]):
    if steps == N-1:
        add s to suffix_map[(r,c)]
        return
    if r-1 >= 0: dfs_suffix(r-1, c, steps+1, s + grid[r-1][c])
    if c-1 >= 0: dfs_suffix(r, c-1, steps+1, s + grid[r][c-1])

# Build maps
dfs_prefix(0,0,0,grid[0][0])
dfs_suffix(N-1,N-1,0,grid[N-1][N-1])

# Collect palindromes
palindromes = empty set
for each cell pos in prefix_map:
    for each s in prefix_map[pos]:
        if s in suffix_map.get(pos, empty):
            add s to palindromes

Print size of palindromes
```

I've saved the complete implementation in **solution.py**. You can run it with Python 3 and feed the input via stdin.
