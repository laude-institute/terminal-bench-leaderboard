[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Mirrors [Brian Dean and Travis Hance, 2013]

Farmer John's cows have been causing too much trouble around the farm, and
FJ therefore wants to keep a more watchful eye on them.  By installing N
reflective fences (1 <= N <= 200) at various locations on the farm, he
hopes to be able to see from his house at location (0,0) to the barn at
location (a,b).

On a 2D map of FJ's farm, fence i appears as a short line segment centered
at integer location (x_i, y_i) and tilted 45 degrees (either like '/' or
like '\').  For example, a fence oriented like '/' at position (3,5) could
be described as a line segment from (2.9,4.9) to (3.1,5.1).  Each fence
(and also the location of the barn) lies at a different position with
integer coordinates in the range -1,000,000...1,000,000.  No fence lies at
(0,0) or (a,b).

FJ plans to sit at his house at position (0,0) and look directly to the
right (in the +x direction).  With his gaze bouncing off some of the
reflective fences on his farm, he hopes to be able to see the point (a,b).
Unfortunately, FJ thinks he oriented one of his fences incorrectly (e.g.,
'\' instead of '/').  Please output the index of the first fence in FJ's
list such that by toggling its direction (between '/' and '\' or vice
versa), FJ will be able to see the point (a,b).

If FJ can already see the point (a,b) without toggling any fence, please
output 0.  If it is still impossible for him to see (a,b) even after
toggling up to a single fence, output -1.

PROBLEM NAME: mirrors

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers, N, a, and b.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 describes fence i and contains either "x_i
        y_i /" or "x_i y_i \", where (x_i, y_i) is the location of the
        center of the fence, and \ or / refers to its orientation.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 6 2
3 0 /
0 2 /
1 2 /
3 2 \
1 3 \

INPUT DETAILS:

A map of the farm looks like this (with H denoting FJ's house and B
denoting the barn):
3 .\.....
2 //.\..B
1 .......
0 H../...
  0123456

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The index of the first fence for which toggling that fence
        allows FJ to see the point (a,b).  If FJ can already see the
        point (a,b), please output 0, or if there is no way he can see
        (a,b) even after toggling up to one fence, please output -1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By toggling the fence at position (3,2), FJ can see the point (a,b).  On
the map:
3 .\.....
2 //./--B
1 ...|...
0 H--/...
  0123456

**Examining mirror reflections**

I’m considering how reflection works, and I know the standard reflection rules for 45-degree mirrors are important. For a "/" mirror, the transformation changes
 (dx, dy) to (-dy, -dx). However, I need to account for the opposite when dealing with a "\" mirror, which should map to (dy, dx). When checking my work, it see
ms I got the direction wrong. I realize I need to carefully determine the right combination of sign changes to achieve the proper mapping.
**Validating mirror transformations**

Let's clarify the correct transformations for the mirrors. For a "/", the path changes as follows: (1,0) transforms to (0,1), and (0,1) goes to (1,0). However,
the sample indicates that it might be different. At coordinate (3,2), with a "/", the beam coming from below moves right, meaning the mapping works as (dx,dy) t
ransforms to (dy,dx).

For the "\" mirror, the correct mapping is (dx,dy) to (-dy,-dx). After verifying these transformations, I’ve confirmed that the movements are consistent in the
four cardinal directions, so I feel confident in the mappings now!
**Simulating beam paths**

I'm looking to create a simulation that starts at the origin (0,0) and moves towards the nearest mirror or barn in the given direction. I need to find which ele
ments lie along the ray based on their coordinates. For rightward movement, I'm checking for mirrors with matching y-coordinates but a greater x-value. I also n
eed to handle toggles for mirrors to determine if the path leads to success.

Eventually, I’ll implement this in a file called solution.py while providing a clear problem restatement, conceptualization, and pseudocode. Once that's sorted,
 I'll apply the necessary changes.

1. The problem: Starting from (0,0) looking right, a ray reflects off 45° mirrors (“/” or “\\”) placed at integer points and you want it to hit the barn at (a,b
). Exactly one mirror may be flipped (or none) to make the ray reach the barn.

2. Approach:
- Simulate the ray’s path: at each step, find the nearest mirror or the barn in the current cardinal direction.
- If it’s a mirror, update the direction by the mirror’s reflection rule and continue; if it’s the barn, success; if it leaves without hitting anything or loops
, fail.
- First check with no flips; if that fails, try flipping each mirror in order, one at a time, and return the index of the first that succeeds.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read N, a, b
store mirrors in dict[(x,y)] = orientation, plus a list of keys in input order

function can_see(a,b,mirrors):
    initialize pos=(0,0), dir=right
    track visited states to detect loops
    loop:
        find nearest object (barn or mirror) along ray
        if none: return False
        move to it
        if barn: return True
        else reflect dir based on mirror
        continue

if can_see(a,b,mirrors): print 0
else:
    for i, key in enumerate(mirror order):
        flip mirrors[key]
        if can_see(a,b,mirrors): print(i+1); exit
        flip back
    print -1
```

4. The solution has been saved to `solution.py`.
