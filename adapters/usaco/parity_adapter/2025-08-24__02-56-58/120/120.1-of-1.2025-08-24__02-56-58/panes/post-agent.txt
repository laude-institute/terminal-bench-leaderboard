[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Nearby Cows [Neal Wu and Eric Price, 2011]

Farmer John has noticed that his cows often move between nearby fields.
Taking this into account, he wants to plant enough grass in each of his
fields not only for the cows situated initially in that field, but also for
cows visiting from nearby fields.

Specifically, FJ's farm consists of N fields (1 <= N <= 100,000), where
some pairs of fields are connected with bi-directional trails (N-1 of them
in total).  FJ has designed the farm so that between any two fields i and
j, there is a unique path made up of trails connecting between i and j.
Field i is home to C(i) cows, although cows sometimes move to a different
field by crossing up to K trails (1 <= K <= 20).

FJ wants to plant enough grass in each field i to feed the maximum number
of cows, M(i), that could possibly end up in that field -- that is, the
number of cows that can potentially reach field i by following at most K
trails.  Given the structure of FJ's farm and the value of C(i) for each
field i, please help FJ compute M(i) for every field i.

PROBLEM NAME: nearcows

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

* Lines 2..N: Each line contains two space-separated integers, i and j
        (1 <= i,j <= N) indicating that fields i and j are directly
        connected by a trail.

* Lines N+1..2N: Line N+i contains the integer C(i). (0 <= C(i) <=
        1000)

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 6 fields, with trails connecting (5,1), (3,6), (2,4), (2,1), and

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Field 1 has M(1) = 15 cows within a distance of 2 trails, etc.

**Explaining the cow counting problem**

I’m looking to create a Python 3 solution for the USACO "nearcows" problem. This involves a tree structure with N nodes where I need to compute the sum of value
s for nodes within a distance K. The solution needs to be efficient, ideally O(N*K), using dynamic programming with two DFS passes. I’ll need to keep track of c
ounts at various distances, ensuring I calculate values correctly for both subtree nodes and those outside the current subtree. Let’s break it down step by step
!
**Implementing the DFS for cow counting**

I’m working on calculating the values for child nodes in relation to their parent. For a child node v of parent p, I want to set up an array that captures the n
umber of cows reachable at different distances. The main approach involves two DFS passes: the first to compute values within each subtree, and the second to ga
ther values that are outside the subtree but still within distance K.

I’ll create an adjacency list, read in the necessary data, and ensure that I handle potential recursion depth issues, especially given the large size of N. Impl
ementing that efficiently is key!
**Planning the BFS traversal**

I’m considering how to efficiently build the data structures needed for the cow counting problem. Since I’m working with lists and adjacency structures, the mem
ory seems reasonable at about 16.8MB. Using BFS for traversing the tree sounds good because it can help establish parent-child relationships while allowing me t
o gather nodes in the right order for processing later.

I’ll initialize the down and up arrays, compute values in a reverse order for the down calculations, and then process in a forward order for the up calculations
. It looks like the structure is coming together nicely for the implementation!
**Finalizing the solution implementation**

I’m making sure to use 1-index arrays for my lists, as that will help avoid off-by-one errors. For memory efficiency, I’ll use two-dimensional lists and even co
nsider using list comprehensions to set these up easily.

I’ll implement the main function to handle input and perform the required computations before outputting results. Using `sys.stdin` will speed up input handling
 for larger datasets. I think everything is in place for me to apply the patch and create the solution file!

**Restatement**
We have a tree of N fields, each with C[i] cows. For each field i, we need M[i], the sum of cows in all fields at distance ≤ K from i.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Root the tree at node 1.
- Compute `down[u][d]`: sum of cows in u’s subtree exactly d edges away (0≤d≤K).
- Compute `up[u][d]`: sum of cows outside u’s subtree exactly d edges away.
- For `down`, do a post-order traversal:
  - `down[u][0]=C[u]`; for each child v and d≥1, add `down[v][d-1]`.
- For `up`, do a pre-order traversal: for child u of parent p and d≥1:
  - `up[u][d] = up[p][d-1] + down[p][d-1] – (d≥2 ? down[u][d-2] : 0)`.
- Then M[i] = sum_{d=0..K} (down[i][d] + up[i][d]).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, K
build adjacency list adj
read C[1..N]
BFS from 1 to get parent[], children[], and order[]
init down[N+1][K+1], up[N+1][K+1] = 0
for u in reversed(order):
    down[u][0] = C[u]
    for each child v:
        for d=1..K:
            down[u][d] += down[v][d-1]
for u in order (skip u=1):
    p = parent[u]
    for d=1..K:
        up[u][d] = up[p][d-1] + down[p][d-1]
        if d>=2: up[u][d] -= down[u][d-2]
for i=1..N:
    M = sum_{d=0..K}(down[i][d]+up[i][d])
    print M
```

The implementation is saved as `solution.py`.
