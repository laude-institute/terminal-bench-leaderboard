the highway prior to mile 1 and for traffic continuing on the highway past mile
$N$.  These ranges should be consistent with all $N$ sensor readings.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$).  Each of the
remaining $N$ lines describes a 1-mile segment of the road, in order from mile
$1$ to mile $N$.  Each line contains a string that is either "on" (if there is
an on-ramp on this segment), "off" (if there is an off-ramp), or "none" (if
there is no ramp), followed by two integers  in the range $0 \ldots 1000$,
indicating the lower and upper endpoints of the sensor range from this segment.
If the segment contains a ramp, the sensor reading is from the ramp.  Otherwise,
it is from the main highway.  At least one of the highway segments will be
designated as "none".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line of output should contain two integers giving the most specific

to exist.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

In this example, the combination of readings from segments 2 and 3 tell us that
the flow rate through these segments is somewhere in the range $[11, 14]$, since
only this range is consistent with both the readings $[10,14]$ and $[11,15]$. In
mile 1, exactly 1 unit of flow enters on an on-ramp, so prior to mile 1, the
flow rate must be in the range $[10, 13]$.  In mile 4, between 2 and 3 units
exits on an off-ramp, so the range of possible flow rates after this is
$[8,12]$.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The highway adjacent to Farmer John's farm has recently seen a dramatic increase
in traffic, or at least so it seems to Farmer John.  To be sure, he wants to
measure the traffic flow on the highway with a set of  sensors, each capable of
measuring the rate of flow of traffic on a  segment of road.

Unfortunately, while walking through the barn one day, Farmer John trips and
drops his box of sensors into a large vat of milk, after which they no longer
work as well.  Instead of producing a single exact reading of traffic flow rate,
each sensor now outputs a range of possible values. For example, a sensor might
output the range $[7, 13]$, indicating that the rate of traffic flow on a
segment of road is no less than 7, and no greater than 13.

The highway runs for $N$ miles next to the farm, and traffic on the highway only
flows in one direction, from mile 1 towards mile $N$.  Farmer John wants to
install $N$ sensors -- one for each 1-mile segment of the highway. In some of
these segments, there are on-ramps that allow traffic to enter the highway; in each of
these cases, Farmer John will install his sensor on the on-ramp to measure
(approximately) the amount of incoming traffic.  In some segments there are
off-ramps that allows traffic to exit the highway; in each of these cases, Farmer John will
install his sensor on the off-ramp.  Each segment contains at most one ramp.
If there is no on-ramp or off-ramp in a segment of highway, Farmer John installs
a sensor on the main highway itself.

Given the readings from Farmer John's $N$ sensors, please determine the most
specific possible ranges that describe the rate of traffic flow initially on
the highway prior to mile 1 and for traffic continuing on the highway past mile
$N$.  These ranges should be consistent with all $N$ sensor readings.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$).  Each of the
remaining $N$ lines describes a 1-mile segment of the road, in order from mile
$1$ to mile $N$.  Each line contains a string that is either "on" (if there is
an on-ramp on this segment), "off" (if there is an off-ramp), or "none" (if
there is no ramp), followed by two integers  in the range $0 \ldots 1000$,
indicating the lower and upper endpoints of the sensor range from this segment.
If the segment contains a ramp, the sensor reading is from the ramp.  Otherwise,
it is from the main highway.  At least one of the highway segments will be
designated as "none".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line of output should contain two integers giving the most specific
range possible for the rate of traffic flow prior to mile 1.  The second line of
output should contain two integers giving the most specific range possible for
the rate of traffic flow after mile $N$.  A valid solution is always guaranteed
to exist.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
on 1 1
none 10 14
none 11 15
off 2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10 13
8 12

In this example, the combination of readings from segments 2 and 3 tell us that
the flow rate through these segments is somewhere in the range $[11, 14]$, since
only this range is consistent with both the readings $[10,14]$ and $[11,15]$. In
mile 1, exactly 1 unit of flow enters on an on-ramp, so prior to mile 1, the
flow rate must be in the range $[10, 13]$.  In mile 4, between 2 and 3 units
exits on an off-ramp, so the range of possible flow rates after this is
$[8,12]$.

[2025-08-24T07:02:29] thinking

**Understanding the traffic problem**

The user is looking for a clear write-up involving a specific coding task: restating a problem in simple terms, providing a conceptual solution, drafting pseudo
code, and saving the solution as a Python file without using external libraries. The problem involves segments that can be in three states regarding highway flo
w: "on", "off", or "none". My goal is to identify the optimal initial and final flow through these segments, working both forwards and backwards to solve it. I'
ll start by laying out the constraints from the "none" segments.
**Processing ranges for traffic flow**

To solve the traffic problem, I’ll work backwards from the broad range of [0, ∞] through the segments. I’ll apply reverse operations to establish the initial fl
ow range. For each segment, if it's "none", I'll adjust the flow based on the sensor constraints. If the segment is "on", the flow before the on-ramp will need
to be decreased accordingly. On the other hand, for the "off" segments, I'll increase the flow to account for the exits. After processing all segments, I'll the
n determine the initial flow range. To find the final flow, I'll work forward from the established initial range, applying the constraints accordingly.
**Outlining the traffic solution**

I need to implement the traffic problem solution in Python. I’ll start by summarizing everything the user needs: restatement, conceptual solution, and pseudocod
e, then save the code in a file named solution.py.

To address the task, I’ll first process the operations as the user indicated, iterating backwards and forwards to determine the initial and final flow ranges. I
'll gather the necessary inputs, set up my operations list, and use backward simulation to establish the flow. After that, I’ll simulate forward and print the r
esults. Finally, I’ll save everything as requested.
**Finalizing the traffic solution**

I need to ensure the final implementation meets the user's requirements. I should print two integers per line, separated by a space, and set a large value for I
NF, say 10^18. I'll also add a main guard for execution. I believe the user won't need extra comments, so I’ll keep it concise.

Now, I’ll structure the final response: first the problem restatement, followed by the solution approach and the pseudocode. After that, I’ll call to save my wo
rk as solution.py. Finally, I'll confirm that it's all set and ready to go!

**Restatement**
- We have N highway segments, each with a sensor reading:
  - “on”: measures cars joining that segment (range [a,b])
  - “off”: measures cars leaving (range [a,b])
  - “none”: measures the total flow on the highway (range [a,b])
- Find the tightest possible range of cars per unit time:
  1. Just before mile 1
  2. Just after mile N
  That is consistent with all sensor ranges.

**Solution Approach**
- Reverse-simulate from mile N back to mile 1, starting with a broad range [0,∞):
  - For “none”: intersect with that sensor’s range.
  - For “on”: subtract the ramp range (clamp ≥0).
  - For “off”: add the ramp range.
  → yields the initial flow range.
- Forward-simulate from mile 1 to mile N, starting with that initial range:
  - For “none”: intersect.
  - For “on”: add.
  - For “off”: subtract (clamp ≥0).
  → yields the final flow range.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
for i in 1..N:
  read type[i], a[i], b[i]

# Backward pass
low, high = 0, INF
for i = N down to 1:
  if type[i]=='none': low=max(low,a[i]); high=min(high,b[i])
  if type[i]=='on':   low=max(0,low-b[i]); high=high-a[i]
  if type[i]=='off':  low=low+a[i]; high=high+b[i]
initial = (low,high)

# Forward pass
low, high = initial
for i = 1 to N:
  if type[i]=='none': low=max(low,a[i]); high=min(high,b[i])
  if type[i]=='on':   low+=a[i]; high+=b[i]
  if type[i]=='off':  low=max(0,low-b[i]); high=high-a[i]
final = (low,high)

print initial
print final
```
