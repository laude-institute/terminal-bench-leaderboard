[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Cow Steeplechase [Brian Dean]

Farmer John has a brilliant idea for the next great spectator sport: Cow
Steeplechase! As everyone knows, regular steeplechase involves a group of
horses that race around a course filled with obstacles they must jump over.
FJ figures the same contest should work with highly-trained cows, as long
as the obstacles are made short enough.

In order to design his course, FJ makes a diagram of all the N (1 <= N <=
250) possible obstacles he could potentially build. Each one is represented
by a line segment in the 2D plane that is parallel to the horizontal or
vertical axis. Obstacle i has distinct endpoints (X1_i, Y1_i) and (X2_i,
Y2_i) (1 <= X1_i, Y1_i, X2_i, Y2_i <= 1,000,000,000). An example is as follows:

   --+-------
-----+-----
  ---+---     |
     |     |  |
   --+-----+--+-   |
     |     |  |  | |
     |   --+--+--+-+-
           |  |  | |
              |

FJ would like to build as many of these obstacles as possible, subject to
the constraint that no two of them intersect. Starting with the diagram
above, FJ can build 7 obstacles:

   ----------
-----------
  -------     |
           |  |
           |  |    |
           |  |  | |
           |  |  | |
           |  |  | |
              |

Two segments are said to intersect if they share any point in common, even
an endpoint of one or both of the segments.  FJ is certain that no two
horizontal segments in the original input diagram will intersect, and that
similarly no two vertical segments in the input diagram will intersect.

Please help FJ determine the maximum number of obstacles he can build.

PROBLEM NAME: steeple

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains four space-separated integers
        representing an obstacle: X1_i, Y1_i, X2_i, and Y2_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
4 5 10 5
6 2 6 12
8 3 8 5

INPUT DETAILS:

There are three potential obstacles. The first is a horizontal segment
connecting (4, 5) to (10, 5); the second and third are vertical segments
connecting (6, 2) to (6, 12) and (8, 3) to (8, 5).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of non-crossing segments FJ can choose.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The optimal solution is to choose both vertical segments.

**Solving programming intersections**

The user has a programming challenge about counting a maximum subset of non-intersecting line segments. We know that horizontal segments don’t intersect among t
hemselves, and the same goes for vertical segments. Intersections only occur between horizontal and vertical segments at specific 2D points. To tackle this, it’
s like finding the maximum independent set in a bipartite intersection graph, where nodes represent the segments and edges connect intersecting segments. The tw
o groups are horizontal and vertical segments.
**Creating a solution for the graph problem**

I'm working on a solution for finding the maximum independent set in a bipartite graph using König's theorem. This involves building a bipartite graph with hori
zontal and vertical segments, finding the maximum matching, and calculating the final answer based on the total nodes minus the matching size. I need to parse t
he input for segments, add edges based on their ranges, and then run the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for the matching.

I’ll also restate the problem and outline the solution in pseudocode before writing the Python implementation in a file named solution.py.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Restatement
   - We have a set of horizontal and vertical line segments. No two horizontals overlap, and no two verticals overlap. We want the largest subset of these segme
nts so that no horizontal crosses any vertical in the chosen set.

2. Conceptual solution
   - Build a bipartite graph where each horizontal segment is a node on the left, each vertical on the right, and an edge means they intersect.
   - In a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set size = total nodes − size of maximum matching (König’s theorem).
   - Compute maximum matching with Hopcroft–Karp, then answer = N − matching.

3. Pseudocode
   ```
   read N
   for each segment:
     if horizontal: normalize ends; add to H list
     else: normalize; add to V list
   build graph edges for each H_i and V_j if they intersect
   matching = hopcroft_karp(graph, |H|, |V|)
   print N - matching
   ```

4. The full implementation is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with Python 3, feeding input via stdin.
