[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In order to save money for a new stall in her barn, Bessie the cow
has started performing in the local circus, demonstrating her remarkable
sense of balance as she carefully walks back and forth on an elevated
balance beam!

The amount of money Bessie earns in her performance is
related to where she manages to ultimately jump off the beam.
The beam has positions labeled $0, 1, \ldots, N+1$ from left to right.
If Bessie ever reaches $0$ or $N+1$ she falls off one of the ends
of the beam and sadly gets no payment.

If Bessie is at a given position $k$, she can do either of the following:

1. Flip a coin.  If she sees tails, she goes to position $k-1$, and if she
sees heads, she goes to position $k + 1$ (i.e. $\frac{1}{2}$ probability of either occurrence).

2. Jump off the beam and receive payment of $f(k)$ $(0 \leq f(k) \leq 10^9)$.

Bessie realizes that she may not be able to guarantee any particular
payment outcome, since her movement is governed by random coin flips.
However, based on the location where she starts, she wants to determine what her
expected payment will be if she makes an optimal sequence of decisions ("optimal"
meaning that the decisions lead to the highest possible expected payment).
For example, if her strategy earns her payment of $10$ with probability $1/2$,
$8$ with probability $1/4$, or $0$ with probability $1/4$, then her expected
payment will be the weighted average $10(1/2) + 8(1/4) + 0(1/4) = 7$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$).  Each of the
remaining $N$ lines contain $f(1) \ldots f(N)$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output $N$ lines.  On line $i$, print out $10^5$ times the expected value of
payment if Bessie starts at position $i$ and plays optimally, rounded down to
the nearest integer.

[2025-08-24T07:48:50] thinking

**Considering calculations and precision**

I'm multiplying something involving `numerator` with `yDiff` and a difference in `x`. I can compute `numerator` with some values, but since we're dealing with l
arge numbers, it can reach up to `1e19`, which is more than what fits in a 64-bit integer. Using doubles for calculations seems safer, especially to avoid issue
s with divisions. I think maintaining `E` as a double and flooring afterwards might be the best approach. I'll outline how to read inputs and build a vector of
points from there.
**Developing the algorithm**

I'm outlining a step-by-step approach to construct the convex hull and calculate values based on points and slopes. For each point, I'll check conditions for th
e hull and pop back accordingly. Afterwards, I initialize an array for results and set up loops to assign values based on the computed slopes. I'm considering p
otential errors with double arithmetic and concluding that using integer arithmetic should keep it safe. Finally, I need to finalize the pseudocode and implemen
t it in Python, ensuring clarity and precision.
**Organizing the answer steps**

I need to structure a four-part response that clearly lays out the approach: I'll start with a restatement of the problem, followed by a conceptual solution, th
en the pseudocode, and finally, include the code in a separate section for the implementation in `solution.py`. I should make sure that each part is concise and
 follows the guidelines, possibly limiting bullet points to about ten lines. I want to ensure that the code has good performance, reading input, computing resul
ts, and printing them efficiently. Let's get started with putting this together!

**Problem Restatement**
Bessie starts at position _i_ on a beam with positions 0…_N_+1 (ends pay 0). At any position _k_ she can either take payoff _f(k)_ and stop, or flip a fair coin
 to move to _k–1_ or _k+1_. We want, for each start _i_, the maximum possible expected payoff under an optimal stopping strategy, then output ⌊10⁵·E[i]⌋.

**Solution Approach**
- The expected‐value function E[i] must satisfy E[0]=E[N+1]=0, and for 1≤i≤N
  E[i] = max( f[i], (E[i–1]+E[i+1])/2 ).
- The “smallest” function dominating f and harmonic (second discrete derivative ≤0) is its concave envelope over the points (0,0),(1,f[1]),…,(N,f[N]),(N+1,0).
- Compute that upper hull in one pass (maintaining non‐increasing slopes).
- Between hull‐vertices (x₁,y₁)→(x₂,y₂), E[x] is the linear interpolation.
- For each x we compute the exact rational value, multiply by 100 000 and floor using integer arithmetic.

**Pseudocode**
- Read _N_ and array _f_[1…_N_]
- Build point list P = [(0,0)] + [(i,f[i]) for i=1…N] + [(N+1,0)]
- Hull = empty list
- For each point Q in P:
  • While |Hull|≥2 and slope(Hull[-2],Hull[-1]) < slope(Hull[-1],Q): pop Hull[-1]
  • Append Q to Hull
- Initialize ans[1…N]
- For each consecutive pair (x₁,y₁),(x₂,y₂) in Hull:
  • For x from max(1,x₁) to min(N,x₂):
    – num = y₁*(x₂–x) + y₂*(x–x₁)
    – ans[x] = (num * 100000) // (x₂–x₁)
- Print ans[1…N], one per line
