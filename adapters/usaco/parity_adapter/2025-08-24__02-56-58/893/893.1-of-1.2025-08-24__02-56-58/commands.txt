Restate the problem in plain English\n2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English\n3. Write a pseudocode solution\n4. Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nWhen bored of playing their usual shell game, Bessie the cow and her friend\nElsie like to play another common game called "guess the animal".\n\nInitially, Bessie thinks of some animal (most of the time, this animal is a cow,\nmaking the game rather boring, but occasionally Bessie is  creative and thinks\nof something else).  Then Elsie proceeds to ask a series of questions to figure\nout what animal Bessie has selected.  Each question asks whether the animal has\nsome specific characteristic, and Bessie answers each question with "yes" or\n"no". For example:\n\n\nElsie: "Does the animal fly?" \nBessie: "No" \nElsie: "Does the animal eat grass?" \nBessie: "Yes" \nElsie: "Does the animal make milk?"\nBessie: "Yes" \nElsie: "Does the animal go moo?"\nBessie: "Yes" \nElsie: "In that case I think the animal is a cow." \nBessie: "Correct!"\n\nIf we call the "feasible set" the set of all animals with characteristics\nconsistent with Elsie\'"\'"\'s questions so far, then Elsie keeps asking questions\nuntil the feasible set contains only one animal, after which she announces this\nanimal as her answer.  In each question, Elsie picks a characteristic of some\nanimal in the feasible set to ask about (even if this characteristic might not\nhelp her narrow down the feasible set any further).  She never asks about the\nsame  characteristic twice.\n\nGiven all of the animals that Bessie and Elsie know as well as their \ncharacteristics, please determine the maximum number of "yes" answers  Elsie\ncould possibly receive before she knows the right animal.\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe first line of input contains the number of animals, $N$\n($2 \\leq N \\leq 100$).   Each of the next $N$ lines describes an animal.  The\nline starts with the animal name,  then an integer $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq 100$),\nthen $K$ characteristics of that animal. Animal names and characteristics are\nstrings of up to 20 lowercase characters (a..z).  No two animals have  exactly\nthe same characteristics.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nPlease output the maximum number of "yes" answers Elsie could receive before the\ngame ends.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n4\nbird 2 flies eatsworms\ncow 4 eatsgrass isawesome makesmilk goesmoo\nsheep 1 eatsgrass\ngoat 2 makesmilk eatsgrass\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n3\n\nIn this example, it is possible for Elsie to generate a transcript with  3 "yes"\nanswers (the one above), and it is not possible to generate a transcript with\nmore than 3 "yes" answers.\n\n\nProblem credits: Brian Dean\n\n[END PROBLEM]\'', 'Enter']
