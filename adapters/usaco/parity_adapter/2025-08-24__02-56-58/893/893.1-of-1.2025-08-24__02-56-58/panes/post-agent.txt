[BEGIN PROBLEM]
When bored of playing their usual shell game, Bessie the cow and her friend
Elsie like to play another common game called "guess the animal".

Initially, Bessie thinks of some animal (most of the time, this animal is a cow,
making the game rather boring, but occasionally Bessie is  creative and thinks
of something else).  Then Elsie proceeds to ask a series of questions to figure
out what animal Bessie has selected.  Each question asks whether the animal has
some specific characteristic, and Bessie answers each question with "yes" or
"no". For example:


Elsie: "Does the animal fly?"
Bessie: "No"
Elsie: "Does the animal eat grass?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal make milk?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "Does the animal go moo?"
Bessie: "Yes"
Elsie: "In that case I think the animal is a cow."
Bessie: "Correct!"

If we call the "feasible set" the set of all animals with characteristics
consistent with Elsie's questions so far, then Elsie keeps asking questions
until the feasible set contains only one animal, after which she announces this
animal as her answer.  In each question, Elsie picks a characteristic of some
animal in the feasible set to ask about (even if this characteristic might not
help her narrow down the feasible set any further).  She never asks about the
same  characteristic twice.

Given all of the animals that Bessie and Elsie know as well as their
characteristics, please determine the maximum number of "yes" answers  Elsie
could possibly receive before she knows the right animal.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains the number of animals, $N$
($2 \leq N \leq 100$).   Each of the next $N$ lines describes an animal.  The
line starts with the animal name,  then an integer $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 100$),
then $K$ characteristics of that animal. Animal names and characteristics are
strings of up to 20 lowercase characters (a..z).  No two animals have  exactly
the same characteristics.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the maximum number of "yes" answers Elsie could receive before the
game ends.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
bird 2 flies eatsworms
cow 4 eatsgrass isawesome makesmilk goesmoo
sheep 1 eatsgrass
goat 2 makesmilk eatsgrass
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

In this example, it is possible for Elsie to generate a transcript with  3 "yes"
answers (the one above), and it is not possible to generate a transcript with
more than 3 "yes" answers.

[2025-08-24T07:36:31] thinking

**Analyzing animal characteristics**

I’m working through the differentiation process when one animal has a characteristic that another doesn’t. So, if there are k common characteristics between two
 animals, Elsie can ask k questions and still have both viable options. The next question needs to differentiate between them, adding another yes count. If she
asks about a unique trait that only one has, she gets a yes but eliminates one option. So the total yes count is k + 1 for that pair. For more than two animals,
 the worst-case scenario arises when the chosen animal is similar to others, leading to a more complex maximum count.
**Evaluating animal comparisons**

I'm considering the scenario of three animals sharing some characteristics. To maximize the yes answers, I should choose an animal that overlaps most with anoth
er. This way, as long as that other animal remains, both stay feasible. Differentiation will only occur when only one is left. Asking about traits that one has
and the other doesn’t can help narrow it down. However, focusing on yes answers is crucial, as no answers don't contribute to the count. So I can maximize yes r
esponses by targeting characteristics that others lack. If two animals share none, you only gain a count of one.
**Planning coding steps**

I'm thinking about how to tackle the problem systematically. First, I'll restate the problem to ensure clarity: we need to read names, followed by K strings for
 each name, and store these strings in sets. Then, I'll iterate through pairs of sets to compute the intersection length, aiming to find the maximum overlap.

The conceptual solution is clear; I’ll outline the pseudocode to provide a roadmap. Since the task seems straightforward, I can directly write the code for solu
tion.py, taking care to follow the structured approach of restating the problem, explaining the solution concept, outlining pseudocode, and then coding it. I’m
feeling good about this! Let's proceed.

+Given N animals each with a set of characteristics, determine the maximum number of
+"yes" answers Elsie could receive before she can uniquely identify the animal.
+
+Approach: For any two animals, if they share k characteristics, Elsie can ask those k
+questions (all answered yes) and still both remain feasible. One more "yes" identifying
+a characteristic of the target animal but not the other will narrow the feasible set to one.
+Thus, answer = max common characteristics between any pair + 1.
