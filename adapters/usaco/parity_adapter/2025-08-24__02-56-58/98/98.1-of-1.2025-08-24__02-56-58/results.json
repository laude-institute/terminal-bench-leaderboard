Save your solution as solution.py\nNo outside libraries are allowed.\n\n[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nProblem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean, 2011]\n\nEvery morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the\nbarn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 100) connected by M\nbidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 10,000), each with an associated length. \nFJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is\njoined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between\nany pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of\npathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a\nroute consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.\n\nFarmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with\nFJ's morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one\nof the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to\nselect a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's\ndistance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine\nby how much they can lengthen FJ's route.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: rblock\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N (1 <= N <= 100) and M (1 <=\n        M <= 10,000).\n\n* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in\n        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where\n        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the\n        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the\n        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n5 7\n2 1 5\n1 3 1\n3 2 8\n3 5 7\n3 4 3\n2 4 7\n4 5 2\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the\nhouse (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's\n        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a\n        single pathway.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n2\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nIf the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4\n(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,\nof total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
