[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Roadblock [Brian Dean, 2011]

Every morning, FJ wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the
barn.  The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 100) connected by M
bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 10,000), each with an associated length.
FJ's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N.  No pair of fields is
joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between
any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of
pathways.  When traveling from one field to another, FJ always selects a
route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with
FJ's morning routine.  They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one
of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length.  The cows wish to
select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in FJ's
distance from the house to the barn.  Please help the cows determine
by how much they can lengthen FJ's route.

PROBLEM NAME: rblock

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N (1 <= N <= 100) and M (1 <=
        M <= 10,000).

* Lines 2..1+M: Line j+1 describes the jth bidirectional pathway in
        terms of three space-separated integers: A_j B_j L_j, where
        A_j and B_j are indices in the range 1..N indicating the
        fields joined by the pathway, and L_j is the length of the
        pathway (in the range 1...1,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 7
2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7
4 5 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 fields and 7 pathways.  Currently, the shortest path from the
house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 1+3+2=6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of FJ's
        shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a
        single pathway.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4
(increasing its length from 3 to 6), then FJ's shortest route is now 1-3-5,
of total length 1+7=8, larger by two than the previous shortest route length.


[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T08:21:19] thinking

**Optimizing shortest paths**

I’m thinking about how doubling an edge weight could affect the shortest path. If it doesn’t impact the current shortest path, then its length remains the same.
 However, if it does change the best path, I need to compute the new shortest path effectively. A straightforward way is to double the weight on edges from the
initial shortest path, run the algorithm, and then restore the weight. Given up to 100 edges in the path, this could require multiple runs, but I could improve
efficiency by utilizing parent pointers to track paths.
**Implementing path adjustment**

I’m planning how to adjust paths while computing the maximum increase in distance. My steps involve reading node and edge counts, storing edges, and setting up
adjacency lists. After running Dijkstra to find the initial shortest path, I need to reconstruct it and then iterate through its edges. For each edge, I'll temp
orarily double the weight, rerun Dijkstra, and track any increase.

I'll store edges as [u, v, w] and adjust the adjacency lists accordingly, ensuring they point to the correct edges. The parent pointers will be crucial for reco
nstructing paths as I implement the Dijkstra function.
**Structuring the solution**

First, I need to set the parent pointers during the Dijkstra algorithm to help with path reconstruction afterward. Once I have the path, I can iterate through t
he edges, temporarily doubling their weights to compute any increase in distance and then restore the original weight.

Next, I’ll draft a clear outline for the solution: restate the problem, explain the conceptual approach, and write pseudocode. Finally, I’ll save everything as
`solution.py` and prepare to deliver it. There's no need for additional tests, so I’ll proceed with creating the file.

**1. Problem Restatement**
Given an undirected, weighted graph of \(N\) nodes and \(M\) edges, find the shortest distance from node 1 to node \(N\). Then, by doubling the length of exactl
y one edge, determine how much this shortest-path distance can be maximally increased.

**2. Conceptual Solution**
- Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the initial shortest path and track parent pointers.
- Reconstruct the specific edges on that path.
- For each edge on this path:
  - Temporarily double its weight.
  - Rerun Dijkstra to get the new shortest distance.
  - Record the increase over the original.
  - Restore the edge’s weight.
- Output the maximum recorded increase.

**3. Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
read edges into list; build adjacency storing (neighbor, edge_id)

function dijkstra():
    init dist[1]=0, others=INF
    init empty min-heap; push (0,1)
    while heap not empty:
        pop (d,u)
        if u == N: break
        for (v,eid) in adj[u]:
            w = edges[eid].weight
            if d + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = d + w
                parent[v] = (u, eid)
                push (dist[v], v)
    return dist, parent

dist, parent = dijkstra()
orig = dist[N]

# Reconstruct edge IDs on the shortest path
path_eids = []
cur = N
while cur != 1:
    pu, eid = parent[cur]
    path_eids.append(eid)
    cur = pu

max_inc = 0
for eid in path_eids:
    save original weight w
    edges[eid].weight = 2 * w
    dist2, _ = dijkstra()
    if dist2[N] < INF:
        max_inc = max(max_inc, dist2[N] - orig)
    edges[eid].weight = w

print max_inc
```
