[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Because Bessie is bored of playing with her usual text string where the only
characters are 'C,' 'O,' and 'W,' Farmer John gave her $Q$ new strings
($1 \leq Q \leq 100$), where the only characters are 'M' and 'O.' Bessie's
favorite word out of the characters 'M' and 'O' is obviously "MOO," so she wants
to turn each of the $Q$ strings into "MOO" using the following operations:

Replace either the first or last character with its opposite (so that 'M'
becomes 'O' and 'O' becomes 'M'). Delete either the first or last character.
Unfortunately, Bessie is lazy and does not want to perform more operations than
absolutely necessary. For each string, please help her determine the minimum
number of operations necessary to form "MOO" or output $-1$ if this is
impossible.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $Q$.

The next $Q$ lines of input each consist of a string, each of its characters
either 'M' or 'O'. Each string has at least 1 and at most 100 characters.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the answer for each input string on a separate line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
MOMMOM
MMO
MOO
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
-1
0

A sequence of $4$ operations transforming the first string into "MOO" is as
follows:


Replace the last character with O (operation 1)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)
Delete the first character (operation 2)

The second string cannot be transformed into "MOO." The third string is already
"MOO," so no operations need to be performed.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4: Every string has length at most $3$.Inputs 5-11: No additional constraints.

**Optimizing string transformation**

I’m trying to optimize a dynamic programming solution for transforming a string `s` into the target "MOO". Given that `s` length is up to 100, my plan is to def
ine a DP structure that calculates minimal operations needed. I need to consider how to transform various segments of `s` while focusing on allowable operations
—deletions at the ends and character flips. It seems like I should align parts of `s` with the target in a way that allows for efficient transformations.
**Analyzing flip operations in strings**

I’m trying to understand the flipping operations needed when transforming a substring into the target "MOM". If the middle character is wrong, it seems impossib
le to flip it directly due to the constraints. For instance, in the string "MMM", getting "MOM" requires ensuring the middle character must be 'O', which isn't
possible if I have a different one. When looking at substrings of length three, operations are limited to flips at the ends after necessary deletions. So, the i
nitial character and the last character are crucial for the flipping process, needing deletion operations and potentially two flips.

[2025-08-24T07:30:03] codex

Here’s the complete solution:

1. Restated the problem
   - Given a string of ‘M’ and ‘O’, you can delete or flip (M↔O) only at the ends. Find the minimal operations to turn it into “MOO” or report –1.

2. Conceptual solution
   - You must delete down to length 3 (cost = n−3). After that, only the first and last chars can be flipped. The middle char must already be ‘O’ (it can’t be f
lipped).
   - For each contiguous substring of length 3 whose middle is ‘O’, compute cost = (n−3) + (substring[0]≠’M’) + (substring[2]≠’O’). Take the minimum, or –1 if n
one valid.

3. Pseudocode
   - Read Q
   - For each string s:
     - If len(s)<3, answer=–1
     - Else:
       - best = ∞
       - For i in 0…len(s)-3:
         - If s[i+1]!=’O’, skip
         - cost = (len(s)-3) + (s[i]!=’M') + (s[i+2]!=’O')
         - best = min(best, cost)
       - answer = best if best<∞ else –1
     - Print answer

4. Implementation saved to `solution.py`.
