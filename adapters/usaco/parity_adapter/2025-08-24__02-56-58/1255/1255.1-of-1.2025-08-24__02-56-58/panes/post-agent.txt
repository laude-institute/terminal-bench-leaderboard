[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John and his archnemesis Farmer Nhoj are playing a game in a circular
barn. There are $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) rooms in the barn, and the $i$th room
initially contains  $a_i$ cows ($1 \leq a_i \leq 5\cdot 10^6$). The game is
played as follows:

Both farmers will always be in the same room. After entering a room, each
farmer takes exactly one turn, with Farmer John going first. Both farmers
initially enter room $1$.If there are zero cows in the current room, then the farmer to go loses.
Otherwise, the farmer to go chooses an integer $P$, where $P$ must either be $1$
or a prime number at most the number of cows in the current room, and removes
$P$ cows from the current room.After both farmers have taken turns, both farmers move to the next room  in
the circular barn. That is, if the farmers are in room $i$, then they move to
room $i+1$, unless they are in room $N$, in which case they move to room
$1$.
Determine the farmer that wins the game if both farmers play optimally.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input contains $T$ test cases. The first line contains  $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 1000$).  Each of the $T$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing $N$, followed by a line containing
$a_1,\dots,a_N$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $N$ is at most
$2\cdot 10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case, output the farmer that wins the game, either "Farmer John"
or "Farmer Nhoj."

SAMPLE INPUT:
5
1
4
1
9
2
2 3
2
7 10
3
4 9 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Farmer Nhoj
Farmer John
Farmer John
Farmer John
Farmer Nhoj

For the first test case, Farmer John can remove $1$, $2$, or $3$ cows from  the
first room. Whichever number he removes, Nhoj can remove the remaining cow(s),
forcing FJ to lose when they circle back to the first room.

For the second test case, FJ can remove $5$ cows, forcing Nhoj to work with only
$4$ cows remaining. Now, Nhoj can either remove $1$, $2$, or $3$ cows. This is
now similar to the first test case.

For the third and fourth test cases, FJ can immediately remove all the cows from
the first room, forcing Nhoj to lose.

For the fifth test case, FJ can remove $1$, $2$, or $3$, cows from the first
room, and Nhoj can remove the rest right after. When they circle back around to
the first room, FJ will lose.

SCORING:
Inputs 2-4 satisfy $N=1$.Inputs 1, 2, and 5-7 satisfy $a_i\le 1000$.Inputs 8-20 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Clarifying implementation steps**

The user wants me to follow a set of instructions for solving a problem: first, I'll restate the problem clearly. Then, I need to conceptualize a solution befor
e writing out pseudocode. After that, I'll save the actual Python code in a file named solution.py. It seems that the final step involves coding the real soluti
on. So, the order is important, and I need to remember to complete each step systematically before arriving at the final solution.
**Analyzing the game dynamics**

I’m looking at a game involving John and Nhoj, where each takes turns removing cows from rooms. The game ends when a player encounters a room with zero cows. Th
ey play optimally and continuously circle the rooms, which makes this an independent gameplay scenario.

Each room acts like a heap in a turn-based game. The outcome depends on the size of each heap, and John has an advantage if there’s a pile larger than one. It s
ounds like I'm diving into game theory concepts, focusing on win and loss conditions based on heap sizes and allowed moves!
**Exploring game outcomes**

I'm analyzing losing positions in a turn-based game involving subtraction. I start by determining positions based on the number of cows. Here’s my breakdown: po
sitions are losing when there are no moves. Winning positions arise when there are options that can lead to a losing state for the opponent.

It seems losing positions might be multiples of 4, as shown in my calculations. The game dynamics rely on players removing cows alternately, creating scenarios
where a player loses if they encounter an empty room. This game flow and turn structure matter significantly; each round brings the risk of running into zero co
ws.
**Implementing the strategy**

I'm considering the problem where John and Nhoj take turns removing cows, and I need a strategy based on the starting room choices. I’ve identified different po
sition types based on the number of cows: immediate wins, immediate losses, and normal states.

My algorithm will traverse the rooms, checking each for winning or losing conditions. If I find a winning position for John, I print that outcome; otherwise, I
print Nhoj's. I’ll implement an efficient prime-checking sieve up to 5 million to assure quick classifications. It looks like I’m ready to move to pseudocode an
d then implement the solution!

**Restated Problem**
We have a circular sequence of rooms, each with some cows. Two players (Farmer John then Nhoj) alternate removing either 1 or any prime number of cows from the
current room. If a player starts their turn in a room with 0 cows, they lose instantly. They each get exactly one move per room visit and then proceed to the ne
xt room (wrapping around). Determine who wins under optimal play.

**Solution Concept**
Observation on the very first visit to each room:
- If the pile has 1 cow or is prime, John can remove them all immediately, making Nhoj lose at his turn in that room.
- If the pile size is a multiple of 4 and composite, any move John makes leaves a “trap” for himself—Nhoj will win immediately on that room.
- Otherwise (composite but not a multiple of 4), John can always avoid immediate loss in that room and move on.

Since John starts every room’s turn and can force a win or loss immediately if either of the first two cases holds, the game outcome is determined by scanning r
ooms in order once:
- At the first room where the pile is 1 or prime → John wins.
- Else, at the first room where the pile is composite and divisible by 4 → Nhoj wins.
- If no such decisive room exists in the full cycle, John eventually ensures a win by cycling back into a composite “safe” pile.

**Pseudocode**
```
read T
for each test case:
  read N and array A
find maximum value in all A to size our sieve
build is_prime[0..max_A] via sieve of Eratosthenes
for each test case:
  for each a in A:
    if a == 1 or is_prime[a]:
      answer = John; break
    else if a % 4 == 0:
      answer = Nhoj; break
  if no break:
    answer = John
  print answer
```

The attached `solution.py` implements this in O(N + max(A) log log max(A)) time, using no external libraries.
