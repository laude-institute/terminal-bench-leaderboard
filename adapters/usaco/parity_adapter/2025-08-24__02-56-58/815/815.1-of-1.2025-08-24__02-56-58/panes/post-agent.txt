[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But something about his log doesn't look quite
right...

Farmer John wants to find out how many breakouts have occurred since he started
his log. However, he suspects that the cows have tampered with his log, and all
he knows for sure is that he started his log on the day of a breakout. Please
help him determine, for each number of breakouts that might have occurred since
he started the log, the minimum number of log entries that must have been
tampered with.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the
counter was at $a_i$, unless the cows tampered with that day's log entry.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output should consist of $N$ integers, one per line. The $i$th
integer should be the minimum over all possible breakout sequences with $i$
breakouts, of the number of log entries that are inconsistent with that
sequence.

SAMPLE INPUT:
6
1 1 2 0 0 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4
2
1
2
3
4

If there was only 1 breakout, then the correct log would look like 0 1 2 3 4 5,
which is 4 entries different from the given log.

If there were 2 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 3 0 1,
which is 2 entries different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first and fifth days.

If there were 3 breakouts, then the correct log might look like 0 1 2 0 0 1,
which is just 1 entry different from the given log. In this case, the breakouts
occurred on the first, fourth, and fifth days.

And so on.

Here’s the full solution:

**Restatement**
Given a log of daily counters showing days since the last breakout (with the first day guaranteed to be a breakout), compute for each possible total number of b
reakouts (from 1 to N) the minimum number of entries that must have been tampered with to match some valid breakout pattern.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Precompute the mismatch cost for every possible segment [s…e], assuming a breakout on day s (counters should read 0,1,2,…).
- Use dynamic programming `dp[i][k]` = minimum mismatches covering days 1…i with exactly k breakouts, the last segment running from some day p to i.
- Base: `dp[i][1]` is cost of a single segment [1…i].
- Transition: for k>1, consider the kᵗʰ breakout starting at day p (2≤p≤i), so
  dp[i][k] = min over p of dp[p-1][k-1] + cost[p][i].
- Finally, output `dp[N][k]` for k=1…N.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N and array a[1..N]
compute cost[s][e] = #mismatches if segment starts at s through e:
  cost[s][e] = sum(a[j] != j-s for j in s..e)

initialize dp[1..N][1..N] = INF
for i in 1..N:
  dp[i][1] = cost[1][i]

for k in 2..N:
  for i in 1..N:
    for p in 2..i:
      dp[i][k] = min(dp[i][k], dp[p-1][k-1] + cost[p][i])

for k in 1..N:
  print dp[N][k]
```

I’ve saved this as `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests or explain further!
