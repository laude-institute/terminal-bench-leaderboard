[BEGIN PROBLEM]

With the hottest recorded summer ever at Farmer John's farm, he needs a way to
cool down his cows. Thus, he decides to invest in some air conditioners.

Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 20$) live in a barn that contains a
sequence of stalls in a row, numbered $1 \ldots 100$.  Cow $i$ occupies a range
of  these stalls, starting from stall $s_i$ and ending with stall $t_i$.  The
ranges of stalls occupied by different cows are all disjoint from each-other.
Cows have different cooling requirements.  Cow $i$ must be cooled by an amount
$c_i$, meaning every stall occupied by cow $i$ must have its temperature reduced
by at least $c_i$ units.

The barn contains $M$ air conditioners, labeled $1 \ldots M$
($1 \leq M \leq 10$). The $i$th air conditioner costs $m_i$ units of money to
operate ($1 \leq m_i \leq 1000$) and cools the range of stalls starting from
stall $a_i$ and ending with stall $b_i$.  If running, the $i$th air conditioner
reduces the temperature of all the stalls in this range by $p_i$
($1 \leq p_i \leq 10^6$).  Ranges of stalls covered by air conditioners may
potentially overlap.

Running a farm is no easy business, so FJ has a tight budget. Please determine
the minimum amount of money he needs to spend to keep all of his cows
comfortable. It is guaranteed that if FJ uses all of his conditioners, then all
cows will be comfortable.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains $N$ and $M$.

The next $N$ lines describe cows.  The $i$th of these lines contains $s_i$,
$t_i$, and $c_i$.

The next $M$ lines describe air conditioners.  The $i$th of these lines contains
$a_i$, $b_i$, $p_i$, and $m_i$.

For every input other than the sample, you can assume that $M = 10$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output a single integer telling the minimum amount of money FJ needs to spend to
operate enough air conditioners to satisfy all his cows (with the conditions
listed above).


SAMPLE INPUT:
2 4
1 5 2
7 9 3
2 9 2 3
1 6 2 8
1 2 4 2
6 9 1 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10

One possible solution that results in the least amount of money spent is to
select those that cool the intervals $[2, 9]$, $[1, 2]$, and $[6, 9]$, for a
cost of $3 + 2 + 5 = 10$.

[2025-08-24T07:09:08] thinking

**Restating the problem**

The user wants a Python 3 solution that involves breaking down the problem into four clear steps. First, I need to explain the problem in plain English. Next, I
'll conceptualize the solution, then draft a pseudocode version, and finally, save the solution as a file named solution.py.

The requirements also specify not using any outside libraries. Constraints include stalls ranging from 1 to 100 and a maximum of 10 air conditioners, each with
different parameters affecting their effectiveness and costs. My goal is to find a minimum cost subset of air conditioners that adequately cools all cows based
on their specified intervals and cooling needs.
**Clarifying cooling requirements**

For each cow, the cooling across the stalls they occupy must be equal to or greater than their specific cooling requirement, c_i. Air conditioners (ACs) cover c
ontinuous ranges, and while they can overlap, they can also individually cover larger areas.

So, if an AC's coverage partially intersects with a cow’s interval, it contributes cooling only to the overlapping stalls. To meet the requirement, for each sta
ll within a cow's interval, the total cooling provided must reach at least c_i.

Even though each cow's stalls are disjoint, overlapping AC coverage still impacts multiple cows. Given that there can be up to 10 ACs at once, I can consider al
l subsets and check their validity efficiently, even if this seems labor-intensive.
**Reviewing the code**

I’m starting with the basic structure of my Python code. It reads the input for cows and air conditioners (ACs), and then calculates the minimum cost of selecte
d ACs that cover the required cooling for each cow.

First, I need to ensure that my indentation is consistent, using four spaces. Then I’ll apply any necessary patches or adjustments as needed. Finally, I’ll incl
ude my reasoning for the solution and prepare to call the appropriate tool to execute the code. I’ll keep an eye out for any final tweaks to improve clarity or
efficiency.

Here’s the complete solution:

Restatement:
- N cows occupy disjoint stall intervals [s_i, t_i] on stalls 1–100.
- Each cow i needs cooling ≥ c_i on every stall it occupies.
- There are M air conditioners, each covering [a_j, b_j], cooling by p_j, costing m_j.
- Choose a subset of ACs of minimum total cost so every cow’s stalls receive enough cooling.

Approach:
- Brute-force all subsets of the M air conditioners (M ≤ 10 → 1024 subsets).
- For each subset, sum its cost; skip if not better than best so far.
- Build an array “cov” of length 100 tracking cooling on each stall.
- Verify each cow’s interval stalls all have cov ≥ c_i.
- Track and print the minimal cost of any valid subset.

Pseudocode:
```
read N, M
read cows list (s, t, c)
read ACs list (a, b, p, cost)
best = ∞
for each subset mask of size M:
    total_cost = sum(costs of ACs in mask)
    if total_cost ≥ best: continue
    cov[1..100] = 0
    for each AC in mask:
        for x in a..b: cov[x] += p
    if every cow’s stalls in cov satisfy ≥ c:
        best = total_cost
print(best)
```

I’ve saved this as `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` and provide input via stdin. Let me know if you’d like test runs or further tweaks!
