[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

Today the cows are a bit sleepy, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive. The $k$ cows whom she passes
will amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after
them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find a sequence of instructions that sorts the
cows in the minimum number of time steps.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers:
$p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$, indicating the starting order of the cows.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line should contain a single integer, $K$, giving the minimum number of time
steps required to sort the cows.

The second line should contain $K$ space-separated integers,
$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K$, each in the range $1 \ldots N-1$.
Furthermore, if in the $i$-th time step FJ
instructs the cow facing him to move $c_i$ paces down the line, then after $K$
time steps the cows should be in sorted order.

If there are multiple optimal instruction sequences, your program may output any
of them.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2 4 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
2 2 3

[2025-08-24T08:16:02] thinking

**Considering a sorting solution**

I need to find an effective solution for sorting cows. First, I’ll restate the problem and conceptualize how to approach it. Then, I’ll move on to writing some
pseudocode for a pure Python solution, ensuring no external libraries are used. Given that N can be as large as 100,000, I want to minimize the number of operat
ions. I realize this relates to the "sleepy cow sorting" problem, focusing on the longest suffix of cows that are in ascending order.
**Analyzing the sleepy problem**

I realize this is the USACO "sleepy" problem! The minimum steps are determined by counting the cows in the prefix that aren't part of the longest increasing suf
fix. For the first K cows, I need to find insertion positions in the sorted suffix, which can be done using binary search, but I should consider performance sin
ce N can get large.

I need to begin by finding the largest increasing suffix and then compute how many smaller elements are in that suffix for each of the first K cows. I’ll mainta
in a sorted list and apply binary search to optimize my steps.
**Creating solution.py for the problem**

I’m working on a detailed approach to solve the problem using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). For each cow in the range of K, I’ll determine how many elements are
less than that cow using BIT to keep track of counts efficiently.

Next, I’ll detail the steps: First, I will restate the problem in plain English and then provide a conceptual solution. After that, I’ll write out the pseudocod
e. Finally, I’ll format and save everything in a file called solution.py, ready for implementation, without including tests. Let’s proceed with this!

I’ve implemented a Python 3 solution using a Fenwick tree to achieve O(N log N). The script reads the permutation, identifies the smallest prefix to move, compu
tes each move count, and outputs the minimal sequence. The full code is in `solution.py`.
