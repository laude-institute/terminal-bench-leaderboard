[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is trying to walk from her favorite pasture back to her barn.

The pasture and farm are on an $N \times N$ grid ($2 \leq N \leq 50$), with her
pasture in the top-left corner and the barn in the bottom-right corner. Bessie
wants to get home as soon as possible, so she will only walk down and to the
right. There are haybales in some locations that Bessie cannot walk through; she
must walk around them.

Bessie is feeling a little tired today, so she wants to change the direction she
walks at most $K$ times ($1 \leq K \leq 3$) .

How many distinct paths can Bessie walk from her favorite pasture to the barn?
Two paths are distinct if Bessie walks in a square in one path but not in the
other.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The input for each test case contains $T$ sub-test cases, each describing a
different farm and each of which must be  answered correctly to pass the full
test case.  The first line of input  contains $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 50$).  Each of
the $T$ sub-test cases follow.

Each sub-test case starts with a line containing $N$ and $K$.

The next $N$ lines each contain a string of $N$ characters. Each character is
either $\texttt{.}$ if it is empty or $\texttt{H}$ if it has a haybale. It is
guaranteed the top-left and bottom-right corners of the farm will not contain
haybales.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $T$ lines, the $i$th line containing the number of distinct paths Bessie
can take in the $i$th sub-test case.

We'll denote Bessie's possible paths as strings of D's and R's, indicating that
Bessie moved either down or right, respectively.

In the first sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the second sub-test case, Bessie's four possible walks are DDRR, DRRD, RDDR,
and RRDD.

In the third sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRR, DRDR, DRRD,
RDDR, RDRD, and RRDD.

In the fourth sub-test case, Bessie's two possible walks are DDRR and RRDD.

In the fifth and sixth sub-test cases, it is impossible for Bessie to walk back
to the barn.

In the seventh sub-test case, Bessie's six possible walks are DDRDRR, DDRRDR,
DDRRRD, RRDDDR, RRDDRD, and RRDRDD.

SCORING:
Test case 2 satisfies $K = 1$.Test cases 3-5 satisfy $K = 2$.Test cases 6-10 satisfy $K = 3$.

[2025-08-24T07:51:56] thinking

**Formulating Python solution**

The user is asking for a Python 3 script to solve a problem that involves counting distinct paths a cow can take in a grid, with specific movement and constrain
t rules.

First, I'll restate the problem in simple terms, then outline a conceptual solution. Next, I'll write the pseudocode and finally save everything into a file nam
ed `solution.py`. The cow can only move right or down, avoiding certain cells and limited by the number of changes in direction.

It’s important I ensure efficiency, considering the constraints provided.
**Structuring the DP algorithm**

I’m developing a dynamic programming solution where `dp[i][j][k][dir]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i,j)` using `k` direction changes, ending i
n a specific direction (`dir`). The directions are indexed as 0 (start), 1 (down), and 2 (right).

Starting from `(0,0)` with no direction and changes, I will iterate through cells, updating reachable positions based on valid movements, while making sure dire
ction changes don't exceed `K`. Ultimately, I'll sum up the counts at the target cell after processing all possible paths.

I believe this approach should handle the constraints efficiently!
**Detailing the DP implementation**

I’m finalizing the dynamic programming logic for my solution, where I'll have three direction indices: 0 for start, 1 for down, and 2 for right. The plan is to
iterate through cells in a row-major order, handling blocked cells accordingly.

Starting at `(0,0)` with no direction changes, I’ll manage movement to neighboring cells, updating the path counts while considering the number of direction cha
nges. The output will sum distinct counts that reach the target cell across allowable direction changes.

I’ll proceed to assemble the final solution with the necessary components.
**Implementing the solution**

I’m preparing to create the Python script using a dynamic programming approach. First, I’ll restate the problem clearly: we need to count distinct paths a cow c
an take in a grid, which only allows movement down or right and has constraints on direction changes.

Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution by utilizing a 4D array to keep track of paths for each cell based on changes in direction. I’ll then write the pseudocode
 followed by applying the patch that generates the `solution.py` file with the final implementation. Time to put this all together!

**Problem Restatement**
Count the number of ways for Bessie to walk from the top-left to the bottom-right of an \(N\times N\) grid, moving only down or right, avoiding blocked cells, w
ith at most \(K\) direction changes.

**Solution Overview**
- Use a 4D dynamic programming array `dp[i][j][c][d]` = number of ways to reach cell \((i,j)\) having used \(c\) direction changes and whose last move was `d` (
0 = start, 1 = down, 2 = right).
- Initialize `dp[0][0][0][0] = 1`.
- Iterate cells in row-major order. From each state, attempt to move down or right, update the change count if the move direction differs, and accumulate ways i
f the target is not blocked and changes ≤ K.
- Sum all `dp[N-1][N-1][c][d]` for \(0 \le c \le K\) and \(d \in \{0,1,2\}\).

**Pseudocode**
```
read T
for each test:
    read N, K
    read grid[N][N]
    initialize dp[N][N][K+1][3] to 0
    dp[0][0][0][0] = 1
    for i in 0..N-1:
        for j in 0..N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 'H': continue
            for c in 0..K:
                for d in 0..2:
                    ways = dp[i][j][c][d]
                    if ways == 0: continue
                    for (di,dj,nd) in [(1,0,1),(0,1,2)]:
                        ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
                        if in bounds and grid[ni][nj]=='.':
                            nc = c if (d==0 or d==nd) else c+1
                            if nc<=K:
                                dp[ni][nj][nc][nd] += ways
    answer = sum(dp[N-1][N-1][c][d] for c in 0..K for d in 0..2)
    print answer
```
