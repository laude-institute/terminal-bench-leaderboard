[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Simplifying the Farm [Nathan Pinsker, 2011]

Farmer John has been taking an evening algorithms course at his local
university, and he has just learned about minimum spanning trees.  However,
Farmer John now realizes that the design of his farm is not as efficient as
it could be, and he wants to simplify the layout of his farm.

The farm is currently arranged like a graph, with vertices representing
fields and edges representing pathways between these fields, each having an
associated length.  Farmer John notes that for each distinct length,
at most three pathways on his farm share this length.  FJ would like to
remove some of the pathways on his farm so that it becomes a tree -- that
is, so that there is one unique route between any pair of fields.  Moreover,
Farmer John would like this to be a minimum spanning tree -- a tree having
the smallest possible sum of edge lengths.

Help Farmer John compute not only the sum of edge lengths in a minimum
spanning tree derived from his farm graph, but also the number of different
possible minimum spanning trees he can create.

PROBLEM NAME: simplify

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers N and M (1 <= N <= 40,000; 1 <= M <= 100,000),
        representing  the number of vertices and edges in the farm
        graph, respectively.  Vertices are numbered as 1..N.

* Lines 2..M+1: Three integers a_i, b_i and n_i (1 <= a_i, b_i <= N; 1
        <= n_i <= 1,000,000)  representing an edge from vertex a_i to
        b_i with length n_i.  No edge length n_i will occur more than
        three times.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 5
1 2 1
3 4 1
1 3 2
1 4 2
2 3 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers representing the length of the minimal spanning
        tree and the number of minimal spanning trees (mod
        1,000,000,007).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4 3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Picking both edges with length 1 and any edge with length 2 yields a minimum
spanning tree of length 4.

**Considering MST counting**

I need to figure out how to count the number of Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) while considering the constraints: N up to 40k, M up to 100k, and weights frequent
 up to 1e6. The goal is to sum the MST weights, as usual, and also count distinct MSTs modulo 1e9+7. I'll apply standard algorithms, like Kruskal’s, and look at
 edges grouped by weights. For each group, I need to determine the number of ways to choose subsets that connect the components.
**Counting spanning trees in components**

I need to focus on the edges in E_w and count the spanning forests for the graph formed with these edges, considering the current components. The goal is to ide
ntify edges that connect different components while ignoring those linking nodes within the same component. By defining E'_w for those inter-component edges, I
gather the connected components of the current DSU. Then, I need to calculate the number of ways to form spanning trees for each component using Laplacian deter
minants. Each weight’s appearance is limited, simplifying the graph, which aids in counting efficiently.
**Calculating spanning trees in components**

When dealing with up to three edges, I need to build a DSU mapping for the relevant components and edges in E'. My goal is to find connected components and dete
rmine if I can form a spanning tree by counting edges. If edges are fewer than nodes minus one, it indicates that I can't form a spanning tree. I can use Kirchh
off’s theorem and compute the Laplacian’s determinant to calculate the number of spanning trees efficiently, ensuring to handle everything modulo 1e9+7. The pla
n is to read and sort edges, initialize DSU, and systematically process each weight group.
**Implementing the MST solution**

I need to multiply `total_count` by `count_c` and apply modulo as I work through the edges. After counting for each group, I’ll perform unions and accumulate th
e total weight. The implementation involves using a Union-Find structure with path compression and union by rank. I recognize that the edges are limited, and fo
r the Laplacian's determinant, I’ll compute it for small matrices. I’ll handle each edge case carefully and create a solution script that reads input, builds ed
ges, and manages the DSU efficiently. I'll focus on modulo operations and ensure the algorithm runs smoothly.

Here’s a self‐contained Python 3 solution implementing Kruskal’s MST while grouping equal‐weight edges to count all possible MSTs via Kirchhoff’s Matrix‐Tree th
eorem on each weight group. It reads from stdin and writes to stdout in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like test cases or further explanation!
