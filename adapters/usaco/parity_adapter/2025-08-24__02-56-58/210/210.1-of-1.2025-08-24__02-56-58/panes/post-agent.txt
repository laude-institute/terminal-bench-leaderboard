[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Milk Routing [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's farm has an outdated network of M pipes (1 <= M <= 500) for
pumping milk from the barn to his milk storage tank.  He wants to remove
and update most of these over the next year, but he wants to leave exactly
one path worth of pipes intact, so that he can still pump milk from the
barn to the storage tank.

The pipe network is described by N junction points (1 <= N <= 500), each of
which can serve as the endpoint of a set of pipes.  Junction point 1 is the
barn, and junction point N is the storage tank.  Each of the M
bi-directional pipes runs between a pair of junction points, and has an
associated latency (the amount of time it takes milk to reach one end of
the pipe from the other) and capacity (the amount of milk per unit time
that can be pumped through the pipe in steady state).  Multiple pipes
can connect between the same pair of junction points.

For a path of pipes connecting from the barn to the tank, the latency
of the path is the sum of the latencies of the pipes along the path,
and the capacity of the path is the minimum of the capacities of the
pipes along the path (since this is the "bottleneck" constraining the
overall rate at which milk can be pumped through the path).  If FJ
wants to send a total of X units of milk through a path of pipes with
latency L and capacity C, the time this takes is therefore L + X/C.

Given the structure of FJ's pipe network, please help him select a single
path from the barn to the storage tank that will allow him to pump X units
of milk in a minimum amount of total time.

PROBLEM NAME: mroute

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N M X (1 <= X <= 1,000,000).

* Lines 2..1+M: Each line describes a pipe using 4 integers: I J L C.
        I and J (1 <= I,J <= N) are the junction points at both ends
        of the pipe.  L and C (1 <= L,C <= 1,000,000) give the latency
        and capacity of the pipe.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 3 15
1 2 10 3
3 2 10 2
1 3 14 1

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ wants to send 15 units of milk through his pipe network.  Pipe #1
connects junction point 1 (the barn) to junction point 2, and has a latency
of 10 and a capacity of 3.  Pipes #2 and #3 are similarly defined.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum amount of time it will take FJ to send milk
        along a single path, rounded down to the nearest integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

27

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The path 1->3 takes 14 + 15/1 = 29 units of time.  The path 1->2->3 takes
20 + 15/2 = 27.5 units of time, and is therefore optimal.

[2025-08-24T07:25:02] thinking

**Conceptualizing a pathfinding solution**

The user wants a comprehensive solution, starting with restating the problem and developing pseudocode before writing the code into a file. The algorithm focuse
s on finding the path from 1 to N that minimizes the formula L + X/C, where L represents the total latencies and C is the path's minimum capacity. For each poss
ible capacity, I’ll analyze the subgraph and determine the shortest path, all while ensuring to avoid external libraries. Since M is 500, I can explore feasible
 unique capacities effectively.
**Analyzing time complexity for capacities**

I’m considering how to optimize the pathfinding algorithm by running Dijkstra’s for each unique capacity. The time complexity will be manageable at about 2.25 m
illion operations, which is acceptable in Python.

First, I'll read the input values and extract unique capacities. For each capacity, I’ll build an adjacency list with edges that meet the requirements. I’ll com
pute the latency and maintain the minimum time while being cautious about precision with divisions. I'll ensure the results are floored correctly, factoring in
possible numeric errors while keeping everything within safe limits.

**Writing the code**

I'm setting up my code to establish `dist` in the initial stage, ensuring it's set to the best value for pruning values that are larger. The best value starts a
s infinity, but that's okay. If `best` equals infinity, I'll avoid the prune checks, which should work smoothly. Once I find the first reachable value, I can se
t `best` to something finite for future comparisons. Now, it's time to write the file and apply the changes!

**Restatement**
We have an undirected graph of N junctions (1 to N) and M pipes, each pipe having a latency L and capacity C. We need to send X units of milk along a single pat
h from node 1 to node N. The time for a path is (sum of latencies) + X/(min capacity along the path). Find the path that minimizes this total time and print its
 floor.

**Conceptual Solution**
- For any candidate bottleneck capacity C, restrict to edges with capacity ≥ C.
- Find the shortest‐latency path from 1 to N in that subgraph via Dijkstra.
- Compute time = (found latency) + X/C.
- Try all distinct pipe capacities (descending), pruning once X/C alone already exceeds the best time so far.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M, X
read all edges into adjacency list, collect unique capacities
best_time ← ∞
for C in capacities sorted descending:
    base_time ← X / C
    if base_time ≥ best_time: break
    // Dijkstra on edges with cap ≥ C
    dist[ ] ← array of size N, all = best_time
    dist[0] ← 0
    PQ ← min‐heap initialized with (0, node=0)
    while PQ not empty:
        (d,u) ← pop
        if d > dist[u] or d ≥ best_time: continue
        for each (v, latency l, cap) in adj[u]:
            if cap < C: continue
            nd ← d + l
            if nd < dist[v]:
                dist[v] ← nd
                push (nd, v) into PQ
    if dist[N-1] < ∞:
        total_time ← dist[N-1] + base_time
        best_time ← min(best_time, total_time)
print floor(best_time)
```
