[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Tile Exchanging [Ray Li]

Farmer John wants to remodel the floor of his barn using a collection of
square tiles he recently purchased from the local square mart store (which
of course, only sells square objects).  Unfortunately, he didn't measure
the size of the barn properly before making his purchase, so now he needs
to exchange some of his tiles for new square tiles of different sizes.

The N square tiles previously purchased by FJ have side lengths A_1...A_N.
He would like to exchange some of these with new square tiles so that the
total sum of the areas of the his tiles is exactly M.  Square mart is
currently offering a special deal: a tile of side length A_i can be
exchanged for a new tile of side length B_i for a cost of
|A_i-B_i|*|A_i-B_i| units. However, this deal only applies to
previously-purchased tiles -- FJ is not allowed to exchange a tile that he
has already obtained via exchanging some other tile (i.e., a size-3 tile
cannot be exchanged for a size-2 tile, which is then exchanged for a size-1
tile).

Please determine the minimum amount of money required to exchange tiles so
that the sum of the areas of the tiles becomes M.  Output -1 if it is
impossible to obtain an area of M.

PROBLEM NAME: tilechng

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N (1<=N<=10) and M
        (1<=M<=10,000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the integers A_1 through
        A_N, describing the side length of an input square
        (1<=A_i<=100).

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 6
3
3
1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 3 tiles.  Two are squares of side length 3, and one is a square
with side length 1.  We would like to exchange these to make a total area of 6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum cost of exchanging tiles to obtain M units of
        total area, or -1 if this is impossible.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Exchange one of the side-3 squares for a side-2 square, and another side-3
square for a side-1 square.  This gives the desired area of 4+1+1=6 and
costs 4+1=5 units.

**Clarifying tile exchanges**

I'm trying to understand if Bi represents any positive integer for exchanging tiles at the store. It sounds like the store only sells square objects, so a tile
of side length Ai can be exchanged for a new tile of side length Bi at a certain cost. If Bi is an arbitrary positive integer, that's possible, but it seems lik
e there are constraints involved. The total area of the new tiles needs to equal a specified target, M, by summing the squares of Bi values compared to Ai.
**Defining tile values and calculations**

I'm considering whether Bi can be zero or if it should be restricted to positive integers. Allowing Bi to equal zero seems odd, especially since the store doesn
't sell size-zero tiles, so I'll set Bi to be at least 1. Given that M is also at least 1, this makes sense. For the dynamic programming approach, I'll calculat
e minimal costs with constraints on Bi from 1 to the square root of M. The plan involves initializing a DP structure for optimal solutions based on the conditio
ns provided. Memory and performance seem adequate for this implementation.
**Drafting the solution plan**

I’m working on outlining a solution for the problem, starting with a restatement. My goal is to minimize the cost of exchanging tiles, considering the given con
straints. Then, I’ll conceptualize how to approach this with dynamic programming, using a list to track the minimum costs for each possible area value.

Next, I’ll sketch out the pseudocode, focusing on calculating new areas with possible tile sizes and updating costs accordingly. Finally, I'll translate everyth
ing into a Python file named solution.py while ensuring I handle edge cases, like returning -1 if no valid solution exists. I think this approach covers everyth
ing needed!

**Restatement**
We have N square tiles with side lengths A₁…A_N (area A_i²). We want the total area of our N tiles to be exactly M by optionally exchanging each original tile f
or a new tile of side length B_i. Exchanging A_i to B_i costs (A_i – B_i)². Each original tile may be exchanged at most once (you can’t chain exchanges). Find t
he minimum total cost to reach total area M, or output –1 if it’s impossible.

**Conceptual Solution**
- This is a bounded knapsack over tiles: for each tile i, choose a new side length B_i ∈ [1…⌊√M⌋].
- Exchanging yields area contribution B_i² at cost (A_i–B_i)²; not exchanging is simply B_i=A_i (area A_i², cost 0).
- Define dp[i][s] = minimum cost to achieve area sum s using the first i tiles.
- Transition:
  dp[i][s+ b²] = min(dp[i][s+ b²], dp[i–1][s] + (A_i–b)²) for each b where s + b² ≤ M.
- Start with dp[0][0] = 0, all else ∞; answer is dp[N][M] or –1 if still ∞.

**Pseudocode**

```
read N, M
read array A of length N
let MAXB = floor(sqrt(M))
initialize dp = array[0..M] filled with ∞
dp[0] = 0

for i in 1..N:
    let a = A[i-1]
    newdp = array[0..M] filled with ∞
    for s from 0 to M:
        if dp[s] is ∞: continue
        for b from 1 to MAXB:
            area = b * b
            if s + area > M: break
            cost = dp[s] + (a - b)^2
            newdp[s + area] = min(newdp[s + area], cost)
    dp = newdp

if dp[M] is ∞:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(dp[M])
```

**Implementation (solution.py)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import math

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    N, M = map(int, data[:2])
    A = list(map(int, data[2:]))

    # Maximum possible new side length we need consider
    max_b = int(math.isqrt(M))

    INF = 10**18
    dp = [INF] * (M + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for a in A:
        newdp = [INF] * (M + 1)
        for s in range(M + 1):
            if dp[s] == INF:
                continue
            # Try exchanging to each possible b
            for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
                area = b * b
                ns = s + area
                if ns > M:
                    break
                cost = dp[s] + (a - b) * (a - b)
                if cost < newdp[ns]:
                    newdp[ns] = cost
        dp = newdp

    result = dp[M]
    print(result if result < INF else -1)
