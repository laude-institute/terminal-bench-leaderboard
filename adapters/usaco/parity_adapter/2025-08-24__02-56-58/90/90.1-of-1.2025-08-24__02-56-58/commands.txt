Unfortunately, he didn\'"\'"\'t measure\nthe size of the barn properly before making his purchase, so now he needs\nto exchange some of his tiles for new square tiles of different sizes.\n\nThe N square tiles previously purchased by FJ have side lengths A_1...A_N.\nHe would like to exchange some of these with new square tiles so that the\ntotal sum of the areas of the his tiles is exactly M.  Square mart is\ncurrently offering a special deal: a tile of side length A_i can be\nexchanged for a new tile of side length B_i for a cost of \n|A_i-B_i|*|A_i-B_i| units. However, this deal only applies to\npreviously-purchased tiles -- FJ is not allowed to exchange a tile that he\nhas already obtained via exchanging some other tile (i.e., a size-3 tile\ncannot be exchanged for a size-2 tile, which is then exchanged for a size-1\ntile). \n\nPlease determine the minimum amount of money required to exchange tiles so\nthat the sum of the areas of the tiles becomes M.  Output -1 if it is\nimpossible to obtain an area of M.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: tilechng\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N (1<=N<=10) and M\n        (1<=M<=10,000).\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the integers A_1 through\n        A_N, describing the side length of an input square\n        (1<=A_i<=100).\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n3 6\n3\n3\n1\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nThere are 3 tiles.  Two are squares of side length 3, and one is a square\nwith side length 1.  We would like to exchange these to make a total area of 6.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The minimum cost of exchanging tiles to obtain M units of\n        total area, or -1 if this is impossible.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n5\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nExchange one of the side-3 squares for a side-2 square, and another side-3\nsquare for a side-1 square.  This gives the desired area of 4+1+1=6 and\ncosts 4+1=5 units.\n\n[END PROBLEM]\'', 'Enter']
