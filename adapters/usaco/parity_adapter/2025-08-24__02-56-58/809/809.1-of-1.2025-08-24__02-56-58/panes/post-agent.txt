[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Early in the morning, Farmer John woke up to the sound of splintering wood. It
was the cows, and they were breaking out of the barn again!

Farmer John was sick and tired of the cows' morning breakouts, and he decided
enough was enough: it was time to get tough. He nailed to the barn wall a
counter tracking the number of days since the last breakout. So if a breakout
occurred in the morning, the counter would be $0$ that day; if the most recent
breakout was $3$ days ago, the counter would read $3$. Farmer John meticulously
logged the counter every day.

The end of the year has come, and Farmer John is ready to do some accounting.
The cows will pay, he says! But lo and behold, some entries of his log are
missing!

Farmer John is confident that the he started his log on the day of a breakout.
Please help him determine, out of all sequences of events consistent with the
log entries that remain, the minimum and maximum number of breakouts that may
have take place over the course of the logged time.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), denoting the
number of days since Farmer John started logging the cow breakout counter.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers. The $i$th integer is
either $-1$, indicating that the log entry for day $i$ is missing, or a
non-negative integer $a_i$ (at most $100$), indicating that on day $i$ the counter
was at
$a_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
If there is no sequence of events consistent with Farmer John's partial log and
his knowledge that the cows definitely broke out of the barn on the morning of
day $1$, output a single integer $-1$.  Otherwise, output two space-separated
integers $m$ followed by $M$, where $m$ is the minimum number of breakouts of
any consistent sequence of events, and $M$ is the maximum.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
-1 -1 -1 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2 3

In this example, we can deduce that a breakout had to occur on day 3.  Knowing
that  a breakout also occurred on day 1, the only remaining bit of uncertainty
is whether a breakout occurred on day 2.  Hence, there were between 2 and 3
breakouts in total.

[2025-08-24T08:14:47] thinking

**Structuring the solution**

I see the user wants a well-structured approach to tackle the problem step by step. First, I’ll restate the problem clearly. Then, I’ll conceptualize a solution
 outlining potential logic. Next, I can draft some pseudocode to ensure the implementation process is clear. After that, I’ll focus on writing the actual soluti
on in Python 3 without any libraries. The essence of the task involves counting sequences of breakout days and ensuring the logs are consistent, then finding th
e minimum and maximum breakouts, or returning -1 if it’s impossible.
**Breaking down constraints and approach**

I see this is a dynamic programming problem, limited to N of 100 and counters up to 100. So, I'll create binary variables to track breakouts. If a breakout happ
ens on day i, the counter resets to 0. For each day, I need to manage the conditions based on known values in the logs, plus find the total number of breakouts
minimum and maximum by iterating across the days.

I’ll initialize the values and steadily build a DP array to keep track of the counts, while calculating possible outcomes based on previous days. The complexity
 seems manageable, and I’ll handle edge cases like unknown counter values appropriately.
**Finalizing the task approach**

Okay, so I need to restate the problem clearly: There's a log over N days, where the counter resets on breakout days. We have some known and unknown counter val
ues, with day 1 confirmed as a breakout. The goal is to find the minimum and maximum number of breakouts based on these logs.

For the conceptual solution, I’ll use dynamic programming to track each day and the possible counter values, ensuring I consider both breakouts and non-breakout
s, while filtering for fixed entries.

I’ll write the pseudocode accordingly, and then I need to generate the solution file. The plan is to implement the logic in Python, define structures for storin
g minimum and maximum counts, and handle edge cases, saving everything neatly in solution.py.
**Implementing the solution**

Alright, I’m focusing on processing the dynamic programming arrays. For each possible counter value, I need to check if the previous day’s data is valid. If the
re's a breakout, I'll reset counters; otherwise, I’ll increment them. I must also validate the input so that the first item is either -1 or 0; otherwise, it's i
nvalid.

When updating the new DP states, I'll ensure to handle cases where a[i] isn't -1. Finally, at the end, I’ll compute the minimum and maximum valid breakouts from
 the last day's data and manage outputs accordingly.

I’ll make sure the code is straightforward, then use the necessary patch to add the completed file.

1. **Restatement**
We have a log of N days showing a counter that resets to 0 on breakout days and increments by 1 otherwise. Some entries are missing. Day 1 is known to be a brea
kout (counter = 0). Determine, among all sequences consistent with the known entries, the minimum and maximum total number of breakouts, or print –1 if no seque
nce fits.

2. **Solution Concept**
Use dynamic programming over days and possible counter values. For each day and each feasible counter `k`, track the best (min, max) number of breakouts so far.
 Start at day 1 with counter 0 and 1 breakout. For each next day, from every previous counter state either:
- Trigger a breakout (counter = 0, breakouts+1) if it matches the log.
- No breakout (counter = k+1) if it matches the log.
Keep only the best min/max breakouts for each counter. At the end, scan all feasible end states to get overall min and max, or detect impossibility.

3. **Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array A[0..N-1]
if A[0] > 0: print(-1) and exit
initialize dp_prev[0..N] = None
dp_prev[0] = (1,1)   # day1, counter0, one breakout
for day from 1 to N-1:
    initialize dp_curr[0..N] = None
    for k from 0 to N:
        if dp_prev[k] is None: continue
        (minb, maxb) = dp_prev[k]
        # breakout today
        if A[day] in {-1,0}:
            update dp_curr[0] with (minb+1, maxb+1)
        # no breakout today
        c = k+1
        if c <= N and A[day] in {-1,c}:
            update dp_curr[c] with (minb, maxb)
    dp_prev = dp_curr
scan dp_prev for all non-None states:
    result_min = min of mins
    result_max = max of maxs
if no states: print(-1)
else: print(result_min, result_max)
```

4. **Solution File**
The full Python 3 implementation has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
