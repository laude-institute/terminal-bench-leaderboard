[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Landscaping [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a
large amount of dirt in the process.

The garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 <= N <= 100), where
flowerbed i initially contains A_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like
to re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B_i
units of dirt.  The A_i's and B_i's are all integers in the range 0..10.

To landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase
one unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for $X.  He can
remove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped
away for $Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to
flowerbed j at a cost of $Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total
cost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.

PROBLEM NAME: landscape

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Space-separated integers N, X, Y, and Z (0 <= X, Y, Z <=
        1000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated integers A_i and
        B_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 100 200 1
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 0

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 flowerbeds in a row, initially with 1, 2, 3, and 4 units of
dirt. Farmer John wishes to transform them so they have 4, 3, 2, and 0
units of dirt, respectively.  The costs for adding, removing, and
transporting dirt are 100, 200, and 1.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum cost for Farmer John's
        landscaping project.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

210

OUTPUT DETAILS:

One unit of dirt must be removed (from flowerbed #4), at a cost of 200.  The
remaining dirt can be moved at a cost of 10 (3 units from flowerbed #4 to
flowerbed #1, 1 unit from flowerbed #3 to flowerbed #2).

[2025-08-24T08:22:34] thinking

**Analyzing a min-cost flow problem**

I'm looking at a problem where I need to transform flowerbeds from an initial state to a desired one, minimizing costs. The key details include different operat
ions: buying, removing, and transporting units between the flowerbeds. It seems like a min-cost flow model applies here, where I treat flowerbed positions as no
des and assess supplies based on surplus or deficit. For deficits, I can purchase externally or transport from other flowerbeds, and for surpluses, I can remove
 or transport. Connecting supply nodes to demand nodes could enhance efficiency.
**Exploring min-cost flow in bipartite graphs**

I’m revisiting a classic min-cost flow problem on a complete bipartite graph. I think including costs for sending surplus units to deficits is key. I need to cr
eate a super-source and super-sink, where I connect edges from surplus nodes to the source and deficit nodes to the sink.

Instead of just focusing on basic capacities, I’ll define positive demands and supplies. The overall goal should be to satisfy all demands, allowing for the cre
ation or removal of units at known costs. The flow amounts will hinge on the sum of deficits and surpluses.
**Refining the transformation model**

I'm considering a transformation model where I need to move dirt amounts from an initial to a desired state. The idea is to create a network with nodes represen
ting dirt locations. For each node, I can set edges with costs and capacities. A super-source connects to each node to represent initial supply, while super-sin
k connects to meet demand. I’ll need to direct flows properly: from supply to demand, considering transportation costs. This approach should help ensure that I
meet the required dirt amounts efficiently.

I’ve added a complete Python 3 solution using a min-cost max-flow approach:

1. **Problem Restatement**
   We have N flowerbeds with initial dirt amounts A_i and target amounts B_i. You can buy dirt (cost X), remove dirt (cost Y), or move dirt between beds (cost Z
 per unit distance). Find the cheapest way to reach the targets.

2. **Solution Concept**
   • Treat beds with A_i>B_i as *suppliers* of (A_i−B_i) units, and beds with A_i<B_i as *demands* of (B_i−A_i) units.
   • Build a flow network:
     – Source→supplier nodes (capacity = supply, cost 0)
     – Supplier→demand edges (capacity large, cost = Z·distance)
     – Supplier→sink (capacity = supply, cost = Y) for removal
     – Source→demand (capacity = demand, cost = X) for purchase
     – Demand→sink (capacity = demand, cost 0)
   • Run min-cost max-flow to route all supply and demand optimally.

3. **Pseudocode**
   - Read N, X, Y, Z and arrays A, B
   - Compute `supply[i] = max(0, A[i]−B[i])`, `demand[j] = max(0, B[j]−A[j])`
   - Create nodes S, T, and N bed nodes
   - Add edges:
     • S→i cap=supply[i], cost=0
     • i→T cap=supply[i], cost=Y
     • S→j cap=demand[j], cost=X
     • j→T cap=demand[j], cost=0
     • i→j cap=∑demand, cost=Z·|i−j|
   - Run standard min-cost max-flow (Dijkstra+potentials)
   - Print total cost

The solution is saved in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like to test it or need further tweaks!
