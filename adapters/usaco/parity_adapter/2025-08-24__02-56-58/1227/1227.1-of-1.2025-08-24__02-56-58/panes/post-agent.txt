[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John, desperate to win the award for best cow photographer at the county
fair, is trying to take the perfect photograph of his $N$ cows
($2 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$, $N$ even).

Farmer John owns cows of two potential breeds: Guernseys and Holsteins.
To make his photo as aesthetic as possible, he wants to line up his
cows so that as many Guernseys are in even-numbered positions in the line
as possible (the first position in the line is an odd position, the next is
an even position, and so on). Due to his lack of strong
communication with his cows, the only way he can achieve his goal is by asking
even length "prefixes" of his cows to reverse themselves (a prefix
consists of the range of cows from the first cow up to the $j$th cow
for some position $j$).

Please count the minimum number of reversals required for Farmer John to achieve
his goal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of $N$.

The second line contains a string of length $N,$ specifying the initial ordering
of the cows from left to right. Each 'H' represents a Holstein, while each 'G'
represents a Guernsey.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the minimum number of reversals needed on a single line.

SAMPLE INPUT:
14
GGGHGHHGHHHGHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, it suffices to reverse the prefix consisting of the first six
cows.


   GGGHGHHGHHHGHG (Before)
-> HGHGGGHGHHHGHG (After)

Before the reversal, four Guernseys were at even positions. After the reversal,
six Guernseys are at even positions. It is impossible for there to be more than
six Guernseys at even positions.

SCORING:
Test cases 2-6 satisfy $N\le 1000$.Test cases 7-11 satisfy no additional constraints.

**Maximizing G's at Even Positions**

I'm exploring how to maximize the number of G's in even positions using reversals of even-length prefixes. Each reversal flips the prefix, changing the parity o
f positions selectively. It's interesting that if I reverse an even prefix, odd positions become even and vice versa. So, I can summarize that reversing an even
-length prefix alters the parity for all positions in that range. Next, I need to calculate the score based on the initial sequence and count the G's in those e
ven spots.
**Maximizing G's at Even Positions**

I’m working on achieving the maximum number of G’s at even positions by flipping even-length prefixes. My goal is to determine how many G's can be placed in eve
n positions, which can be no more than half of the total number of G's or half the number of cows.

After checking the initial G count at even positions, I need to see if I can reach the maximum with a minimum number of flips. It seems I should start by precom
puting counts to check possible outcomes with one or two operations.
**Analyzing Maximum G's at Even Positions**

I'm exploring how to determine the maximum number of G's at even positions through even-length prefix reversals. It seems like I can only rearrange while preser
ving certain parities, which might limit reachable states. The goal is to calculate the maximum achievable G's at these positions, factoring in the flips' effec
ts on the parity.

After assessing the outcomes of one or two operations, I need to initiate a method to compute the maximum E reachable with the minimal number of flips. The oper
ations' invertible nature complicates direct calculations, but I should focus on the contributions from these changes.
**Identifying Maximum G's with Reversals**

I'm considering how to maximize the number of G's at even positions through even-length prefix reversals, almost like a longest increasing subsequence problem.
The main challenge is finding reachable permutations that allow for moving G's in a way that maintains even placement.

It seems that the individual constraints, like the number of G’s needing to be even, might get in the way. I'll need to explore how to determine the maximum num
ber of G's achievable in this situation while minimizing the number of operations—perhaps only one or two reversals might be sufficient.

**Restated Problem**
You're given an even-length string of ‘G’ and ‘H’ (cows). You can reverse any even-length prefix of the string. Your goal is to maximize the number of ‘G’ chara
cters in even-numbered positions (1-indexed) using the fewest reversals.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Compute the current count of ‘G’s in even positions (`initial`).
- A single reversal of an even-length prefix of length *j* flips which characters in that prefix occupy even positions. The net gain in even-positioned ‘G’s is
`(#G at odd positions in prefix) - (#G at even positions in prefix)`.
- By trying every even prefix length once (O(N) total), we find the best possible gain from a single reversal.
- If that best gain improves upon `initial`, the answer is 1; otherwise it’s already optimal (0 reversals).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read s (length N)
initial = count of G at even positions in s
build prefix sums:
  pref_odd[i]  = # of Gs at odd positions up to i
  pref_even[i] = # of Gs at even positions up to i
best = initial
for j in 2,4,…,N:
  delta = pref_odd[j] - pref_even[j]
  best = max(best, initial + delta)
if best > initial:
  print 1
else:
  print 0
```

**Implementation**
The solution is saved to `solution.py`. It reads from stdin and writes the answer (0 or 1) to stdout.
