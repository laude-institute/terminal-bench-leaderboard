cows specified on the first line of input (for simplicity, let'"'"'s call these two
cows BESSIE and ELSIE for the examples below).  Here are the different types of
relationships that are possible:
You should output "SIBLINGS" if BESSIE and ELSIE have the same mother.BESSIE might be a direct descendant of ELSIE, meaning that ELSIE is either
the mother, grand-mother, great-grand-mother, great-great-grand-mother, etc., of
BESSIE. If this is the case, you should print "ELSIE is the (relation) of
BESSIE", where (relation) is the appropriate relationship, for example
"great-great-grand-mother".If ELSIE is a child of an ancestor of

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John owns a family-run farm that has been passed down over several
generations, with a herd of cows whose familial roots can similarly be traced
back several generations on the same farm.  By examining old records, Farmer
John is curious how the cows in his current herd are related to each-other.
Please help him in this endeavor!

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$) followed by the names
of two cows.  Cow names are each strings of at most 10 uppercase letters
($A \ldots Z$). Farmer John is curious about the relationship between the two
cows on this line of input.

The next $N$ lines each contain two cow names $X$ and $Y$, indicating that $X$
is the mother of $Y$.

**Clarifying family relationships**

I’m working through how to identify relationships in a family tree. For instance, depth indicates the relationship: depth 2 represents an aunt; depth 3 is a gre
at-aunt, and so on. I need to be careful with counting depth from the first cow to the ancestor. So, if I’m at depth 2, I’m looking at a grandmother, and her ch
ildren are the mothers and aunts. For depth 3, I'd be considering great-aunts as the siblings of a grandmother. Keeping this clear is key!
**Defining family relations**

I'm figuring out how to define family relations based on depth in a family tree. The idea is that the relationship is defined by how many generations separate i
ndividuals. For example, if I have an ancestor at depth 2 (like a grandmother), their siblings are aunts or great-aunts depending on the generational depth. So,
 if a cow2's mother is at depth 2 and is a child of cow1's grandmother, cow2 is an aunt to cow1. The terminology becomes clearer as I go deeper!
**Planning ancestor mapping**

I’m forming a plan for organizing ancestor relationships based on family trees. The goal is to map ancestors to their respective depths by ascending through the
 maternal line, starting at depth 1. I need to check if two cows share mothers or if one is an ancestor of the other, printing their relationship cleanly.

For instance, if one cow's mother is also an ancestor of another, I’ll specify their relationship clearly. If there's no direct relationship but common ancestor
s exist, I’ll label them as cousins, or mark them as "not related" if there’s no connection. Careful implementation will be key!

**Restatement**

We have a record of which cow is the mother of which, forming a family tree. Given two cow names, we need to determine their relationship:
- “SIBLINGS” if they share the same mother.
- If one is an ancestor of the other, describe exact degree (mother, grand-mother, great-…-grand-mother).
- If one is a child of an ancestor of the other (but not ancestor or sibling), call them aunt/great-aunt as appropriate.
- If they share any other common ancestor, they are “COUSINS”.
- Otherwise, “NOT RELATED”.

**Solution Approach**

- Read input and build a `parent` map from child → mother.
- For each target cow, walk up the tree to record all ancestors with their distance (depth).
- Check in order:
  1. Same mother → SIBLINGS
  2. One in the other’s ancestor map → direct descendant, build the proper “(great-…)grand-mother” string.
  3. If one’s mother is in the other’s ancestor map at depth ≥2 → aunt/great-aunt (depth - 2 determines number of “great-”).
  4. If ancestor maps intersect → COUSINS
  5. Else → NOT RELATED

**Pseudocode**

```
read N, cow1, cow2
for N lines:
    read X (mother), Y (child)
    parent[Y] = X

function get_ancestors(cow):
    ancestors = {}
    depth = 0
    while cow has a mother:
        depth += 1
        cow = parent[cow]
        ancestors[cow] = depth
    return ancestors

anc1 = get_ancestors(cow1)
anc2 = get_ancestors(cow2)

# 1. siblings?
if parent[cow1] == parent[cow2] and both mothers exist:
    print SIBLINGS
    exit

# 2. direct descendant?
if cow2 in anc1:
    print “cow2 is the {descendant_name(anc1[cow2])} of cow1”
    exit
if cow1 in anc2:
    print “cow1 is the {descendant_name(anc2[cow1])} of cow2”
    exit

# 3. aunt/great-aunt?
if parent[cow2] in anc1 and anc1[parent[cow2]] >= 2:
    print “cow2 is the {aunt_name(anc1[parent[cow2]])} of cow1”
    exit
if parent[cow1] in anc2 and anc2[parent[cow1]] >= 2:
    print “cow1 is the {aunt_name(anc2[parent[cow1]])} of cow2”
    exit

# 4. cousins?
if anc1.keys() ∩ anc2.keys() is nonempty:
    print COUSINS
else:
    print NOT RELATED
```

I’m now implementing this solution in `solution.py`.
