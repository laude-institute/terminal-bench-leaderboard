[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's cows have recently become fans of playing a simple number game
called "FizzBuzz".  The rules of the game are simple: standing in a circle, the
cows sequentially count upward from one, each cow saying a single number when it
is her turn.  If a cow ever reaches a multiple of 3, however, she should say
"Fizz" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 5, she should say
"Buzz" instead of that number.  If a cow reaches a multiple of 15, she should
say "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.  A transcript of the first part of a game
is therefore:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16

Having a slightly more limited vocabulary, the version of FizzBuzz played by the
cows involves saying "Moo" instead of Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.  The beginning
of the cow version of the game is therefore

1, 2, Moo, 4, Moo, Moo, 7, 8, Moo, Moo, 11, Moo, 13, 14, Moo, 16

Given $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$), please determine the $N$th number spoken in
this game.

SCORING
Test cases 2-5 satisfy $N\le 10^6.$

INPUT FORMAT:
The input consists of a single integer, $N$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please print out the $N$th number spoken during the game.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
7

The 4th number spoken is 7.  The first 4 numbers spoken are 1, 2, 4, 7, since we
skip over any time a cow says "Moo".

**Developing Python Solution**

The user is looking for a Python 3 solution using a four-step process. First, I need to restate the problem: find the Nth number that isn't divisible by 3 or 5.
 Next, I'll conceptualize the solution, which involves generating numbers and excluding multiples of 3 and 5. The next step is writing pseudocode for this logic
. Finally, I’ll save the completed code as solution.py. The focus is on correctly following these steps while adhering to the constraints provided.
**Analyzing the Nth Element Problem**

The task involves finding the Nth positive integer not divisible by 3 or 5, where N can be as large as 1e9. I’ll define a function, f(x), to count the applicabl
e numbers up to x, using the formula f(x) = x - floor(x/3) - floor(x/5) + floor(x/15). The goal is to find the smallest x for which f(x) is at least N using bin
ary search, initially estimating x up to 2N for safety. This ensures that I efficiently find and print the Nth number. Time complexity is O(log N).
**Planning Python Solution**

I need to develop a solution for the user’s request by following a structured four-step process. The first step is to restate the problem—finding the Nth positi
ve integer not divisible by 3 or 5. Next, I’ll conceptualize the solution in plain English, highlighting how I’ll use binary search to find the result. For the
third step, I’ll create pseudocode to outline the implementation. Lastly, I’ll save the code as solution.py using the appropriate method to ensure it’s ready fo
r use. Time to craft the final narrative and generate the code!

1. Restatement
- We need the Nth positive integer that isn’t a multiple of 3 or 5.

2. Conceptual solution
- Numbers spoken are those not divisible by 3 or 5.
- Define f(x) = count of valid numbers ≤ x = x – ⌊x/3⌋ – ⌊x/5⌋ + ⌊x/15⌋.
- Binary-search for the smallest x where f(x) ≥ N; that x is the answer.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
define count_spoken(x):
    return x - x//3 - x//5 + x//15

lo = 1
hi = 2 * N      # ensures f(hi) > N
while lo < hi:
    mid = (lo + hi) // 2
    if count_spoken(mid) >= N:
        hi = mid
    else:
        lo = mid + 1

output lo
```

4. Implementation saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py`.
