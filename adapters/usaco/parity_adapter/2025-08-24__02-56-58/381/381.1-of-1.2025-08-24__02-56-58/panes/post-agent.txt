[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Recording the Moolympics [Brian Dean, 2014]

Being a fan of all cold-weather sports (especially those involving cows),
Farmer John wants to record as much of the upcoming winter Moolympics as
possible.

The television schedule for the Moolympics consists of N different programs
(1 <= N <= 150), each with a designated starting time and ending time.  FJ
has a dual-tuner recorder that can record two programs simultaneously.
Please help him determine the maximum number of programs he can record in
total.

PROBLEM NAME: recording

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the start and end time of a single
        program (integers in the range 0..1,000,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
0 3
6 7
3 10
1 5
2 8
1 9

INPUT DETAILS:

The Moolympics broadcast consists of 6 programs.  The first runs from time
0 to time 3, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of programs FJ can record.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can record at most 4 programs.  For example, he can record programs 1
and 3 back-to-back on the first tuner, and programs 2 and 4 on the second
tuner.

**Clarifying scheduling steps**

The user wants to solve a scheduling problem involving N intervals and two recorders without overlap. The goal is to maximize the intervals scheduled on both re
corders. The approach is to use a greedy method: sort the intervals by their end time and track the next available time for each recorder. If an interval can fi
t into one of the recorders, I’ll schedule it; otherwise, I'll skip it. This leads to a structured solution with the required pseudocode and implementation in P
ython 3.
**Refining scheduling technique**

I’m exploring the greedy approach for maximizing intervals across multiple machines. This strategy involves assigning each interval to the first available machi
ne, sorting by the earliest finish time, and ensuring it fits the schedule. While this greedy algorithm is optimal for any number of machines, dynamic programmi
ng could be an option for larger data sets. I’ll maintain a list of machine availability times, noting that only intervals starting at or after zero are accepta
ble. This structure will help manage overlapping jobs effectively.
**Structuring the algorithm**

I’m outlining an algorithm for maximizing TV program recordings on two machines without overlap. First, I’ll read the number of intervals and their start and en
d times, then sort them by end times. For each interval, I will determine if a machine is free to record it, picking the one that becomes available most recentl
y to maintain flexibility. The final output will count the maximum intervals recorded. I’ll also ensure my implementation adheres to Python 3 requirements and a
void any external libraries. Next, I’ll format everything clearly for the user.
**Preparing to save solution**

The user wants to see the reasoning for creating a `solution.py` file. First, I'll provide the restatement and conceptualization, followed by the pseudocode. Ne
xt, I’ll say something like, “I’m now writing solution.py,” and then I’ll save it using a specific method. It’s crucial to inform the user about my intent befor
e proceeding with longer tasks, so I’ll keep that in mind. Finally, I’ll ensure the implementation aligns with the specified algorithm and requirements. Let’s g

1. Restatement
- We have N TV programs, each with a start and end time, and two recorders that can run simultaneously. We need to pick as many non-overlapping programs as poss
ible across the two recorders.

2. Solution Idea
- Sort programs by their end times (earliest first).
- Keep track of when each recorder becomes free (`avail1`, `avail2`).
- Greedily iterate through programs: if either recorder is free at the program’s start, assign it—preferring the one that became free most recently when both ar
e available.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list of (start, end) intervals
sort intervals by end ascending
avail1 = 0
avail2 = 0
count = 0
for each (start, end) in intervals:
    if start >= avail1 and start >= avail2:
        # both free: assign to recorder with larger avail
        if avail1 <= avail2:
            avail2 = end
        else:
            avail1 = end
        count += 1
    elif start >= avail1:
        avail1 = end
        count += 1
    elif start >= avail2:
        avail2 = end
        count += 1
    # else: skip
print(count)
```

4. Implementation
The file `solution.py` has been created with the described solution. You can run it with Python 3 and feed the input via stdin:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
