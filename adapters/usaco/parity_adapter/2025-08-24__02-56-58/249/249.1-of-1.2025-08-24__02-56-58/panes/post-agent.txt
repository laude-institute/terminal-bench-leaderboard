[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Route Designing [Yan Gu, 2013]

After escaping from the farm, Bessie has decided to start a travel
agency along the Amoozon river.  There are several tourist sites
located on both sides of the river, each with an integer value
indicating how interesting the tourist site is.

Tourist sites are connected by routes that cross the river (i.e.,
there are no routes connecting a site with a site on the same side of
the river).  Bessie wants to design a tour for her customers and needs
your help.  A tour is a sequence of tourist sites with adjacent sites
connected by a route. In order to best serve her customers she wants
to find the route that maximizes the sum of the values associated with
each visited site.

However, Bessie may be running several of these tours at the same
time.  Therefore it's important that no two routes on a tour
intersect.  Two routes (a <-> x) and (b <-> y) intersect if and only
if (a < b and y < x) or (b < a and x < y) or (a = b and x = y).

Help Bessie find the best tour for her agency.  Bessie may start and end at
any site on either side of the Amoozon.

PROBLEM NAME: route

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space separated integers N (1 <= N <= 40,000), M (1 <=
        M <= 40,000), and R (0 <= R <= 100,000) indicating
        respectively the number of sites on the left side of the
        river, the number of sites on the right side of the river, and
        the number of routes.

* Lines 2..N+1: The (i+1)th line has a single integer, L_i (0 <= L_i
        <= 40,000), indicating the value of the ith tourist site on
        the left side of the river.

* Lines N+2..N+M+1: The (i+N+1)th line has a single integer, R_i (0 <=
        R_i <= 40,000), indicating the value of the ith tourist site
        on the right side of the river.

* Lines N+M+2..N+M+R+1: Each line contains two space separated
        integers I (1 <= I <= N) and J (1 <= J <= M) indicating there
        is a bidirectional route between site I on the left side of
        the river and site J on the right side of the river.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 2 4
1
1
5
2
2
1 1
2 1
3 1
2 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are three sites on the left side of the Amoozon with values 1,
1, and 5.  There are two sites on the right side of the Amoozon with
values 2 and 2.  There are four routes connecting sites on both sides
of the river.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer indicating the maximum sum of values
        attainable on a tour.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

8

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The optimal tour goes from site 1 on the left, site 1 on the right, and
ends at site 3 on the left.  These respectively have values 1, 2, and 5
giving a total value of the trip of 8.

**Exploring path constraints**

With positive weights, paths might loop to inflate results, but they can only cross the river once, which complicates things. To loop, they'd need to go back an
d forth across a crossing route, using the same edge twice. Yet, they can't do that; they're likely avoiding revisiting edges. So, the practical goal is to find
 the maximum-weight path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the edges are routes and paths do not cross. Each route is a point in the plane needing a non-d
ecreasing sequence.
**Defining weighted paths**

So, I'm analyzing a weighted longest chain in 2D, where points correspond to routes but the path's value is based on the sum of visited sites, not edges. The sc
oring focuses on site weights, with the need to visit nodes alternately between left and right, starting anywhere.

To manage this, I can define dpL[i] for the best tour ending at left site i, and dpR[j] for the one ending at right site j. I’ll need to compute these, ensuring
 non-crossing paths by processing edges in a proper order to maintain a non-decreasing sequence. It gets tricky since updates to dpL and dpR depend on this orde
ring.
**Considering path optimization**

I’m thinking about processing edges in two passes. I can sort edges by (i,j), then compute updates for dpR in a temporary array. For dpL, I realize it also upda
tes from dpR, and the challenge lies in ensuring non-crossing paths.

The concept translates into a maximum weighted chain within a directed acyclic graph of routes. So, I’ll collect edges, ensuring that for each node, I process e
vents that maintain the order. I need to ensure unique left and right nodes are maximized without revisiting, creating a clear sequence of increasing indices fo
r both dimensions.
**Examining path structures**

I’m contemplating how redundant edges are irrelevant, requiring that i2 > i1 and j2 > j1, leading to an increasing chain of edges. This creates a 2D partial ord
er where the goal is to find a weighted chain with unique endpoints. The challenge is that while each edge can connect a left node to a right node, the sum of w
eights needs to account for duplicates along the path.

To simplify, I’ll convert this into a directed acyclic graph where the edges represent route points, enabling a more manageable approach to ensure edges alterna
te and maintain clarity in connections. This includes defining states for arriving on each side, leading to maximum sums based on previously defined paths.
**Preparing to implement solution**

I'm considering input indices, deciding to store weights and edges in a way that aligns with how Python indexes start at zero. I’ll set up some structures and i
terate through edge lists while computing values for `dp1` and `dp2`. I need to ensure that initial conditions are correct for proper calculations.

Once that's set, I plan to draft a clear message combining four sections: restating the problem, the conceptual solution, pseudocode, and notifying that the sol
ution is stored in a new file, `solution.py`. Lastly, I’ll call for the patch to create this file in the appropriate way.

1. Problem Restatement
Find the maximum‐value tour in a bipartite graph (left sites and right sites) where you alternate sides along river‐crossing routes, summing site values, and en
sure no two routes “cross” (i.e. edges form a non‐decreasing sequence in both site indices).

2. Conceptual Solution
- Model each route as linking a left node i and right node j.
- Define two DP states on each route:
  • dp2[i,j]: best tour sum ending on the left at site i via route (i,j).
  • dp1[i,j]: best tour sum ending on the right at site j via route (i,j).
- Recurrences enforce non‐crossing by only extending from smaller indices:
  • dp2[i,j] = wL[i] + max(wR[j], best dp1 for same j and any earlier i)
  • dp1[i,j] = wR[j] + max(wL[i], best dp2 for same i and any earlier j)
- Sweep i from 1..N, and for each i, process its routes in increasing j, maintaining per‐row and per‐column maxima.

3. Pseudocode
read N,M,R
read wL[0..N−1], wR[0..M−1]
build edges[i] = sorted list of j’s for each route (i,j)
initialize bestDP1col[j]=0 for all j
ans = max(max(wL), max(wR))
for i in 0..N−1:
  rowMax = 0
  for j in edges[i]:
    dp2 = wL[i] + max(wR[j], bestDP1col[j])
    dp1 = wR[j] + max(wL[i], rowMax)
    rowMax = max(rowMax, dp2)
    bestDP1col[j] = max(bestDP1col[j], dp1)
    ans = max(ans, dp1, dp2)
print(ans)
