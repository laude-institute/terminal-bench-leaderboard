[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Liars and Truth Tellers [Brian Dean, 2013]

After spending so much time around his cows, Farmer John has started to
understand their language.  Moreover, he notices that among his N cows
(2 <= N <= 1000), some always tell the truth while others always lie.

FJ carefully listens to M statements (1 <= M <= 10,000) from his cows, each
of the form "x y T", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells the
truth" or "x y L", meaning that "cow x claims cow y always tells lies".
Each statement involves a pair of different cows, and the same pair of cows
may appear in multiple statements.

Unfortunately, FJ believes he might have written down some entries in his
list incorrectly, so there may not be a valid way to designate each cow as
a truth teller or a liar that is consistent with all the M statements on
FJ's list.  To help FJ salvage as much of his list as possible, please
compute the largest value of A such that there exists a valid way to
designate each cow as a truth teller or a liar in a manner that is
consistent with the first A entries in FJ's list.

PROBLEM NAME: truth

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..1+M: Each line is of the form "x y L" or "x y T",
        describing a statement made by cow x about cow y.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 3
1 4 L
2 3 T
4 1 T

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 cows and 3 statements.  Cow 1 says that cow 4 lies, cow 2 says
that cow 3 tells the truth, and cow 4 says that cow 1 tells the truth.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum value of A such that the first A entries in FJ's
        list can be consistent with some assignment of "truth teller"
        or "liar" to the N cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Statements 1 and 3 cannot both be satisfied at the same time, but
statements 1 and 2 can be, if we let cows 1..3 tell the truth and cow 4 be
a liar.

**Formulating a Python solution**

The user is asking for a Python 3 solution, including logic and pseudocode, then save it as solution.py without tests. This problem is a classic 2-SAT or graph
consistency issue where cows can either tell the truth or lie. Each cow's statement about another's truthfulness sets constraints: for truthful statements (T),
the cows share the same status; for lying (L), they differ. I’ll assign variables indicating each cow's truthfulness, treating truthful cows as 1 and liars as 0
. Let's structure the solution!
**Planning the solution steps**

I'm breaking down the problem into manageable parts. Each statement links two variables, v_x and v_y, that represent truth-telling cows. If cow x tells the trut
h, v_y matches v_x; if lying, they don’t match. For T, this forms a consistency condition; for L, it creates a contradiction.

I’ll state the problem clearly, explain the solution in plain English, write pseudocode, and then save everything in solution.py. While the user didn't specify
using union-find, it could be an effective method. I’ll keep a straightforward approach here!
**Getting ready to implement**

Alright, since M can be as large as 10,000, I need to be mindful of repeated initializations in the disjoint-set union (DSU) method, which costs O(N + M) per ch
eck. With a logarithmic binary search over M, that’s about 14 checks, which is manageable. I’m ready to start coding now and will create solution.py based on ev
erything I’ve planned. Let's get to it and make sure everything fits together well!

1. Restated: Determine the largest prefix of M statements about N cows (truth-tellers vs. liars) that can be consistently assigned.

2. Approach:
- Model each cow as a binary variable (0=liar, 1=truth).
- Each statement adds a parity constraint (equal or opposite) between two cows.
- Use a union-find with parity tracking to incrementally apply constraints.
- Binary search on the prefix length to find the maximum consistent A.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read N, M
read statements into list stm (x, y, d) where d=0 for T, 1 for L

class DSU:
    init parent, rank, parity arrays
    find(x): path-compress, accumulate parity
    union(x, y, d):
        find roots rx, ry with parities px, py
        if rx==ry: return (px^py)==d else merge, set parity, return True

function check(k):
    init DSU
    for i in 0..k-1:
        if not union(stm[i]): return False
    return True

binary search low=0, high=M:
    mid=(low+high+1)//2
    if check(mid): low=mid
    else: high=mid-1
print low
```
