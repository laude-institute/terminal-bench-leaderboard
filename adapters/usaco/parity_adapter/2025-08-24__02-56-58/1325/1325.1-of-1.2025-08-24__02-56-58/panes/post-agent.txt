[BEGIN PROBLEM]

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 4s, 2x the default.**
To celebrate the start of spring, Farmer John's $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) have invented an intriguing new dance, where they stand in a circle and
re-order themselves in a predictable way.

Specifically, there are $N$ positions around the circle, numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$, with position $0$ following position $N-1$.  A cow resides at
each position.  The cows are also numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$.  Initially, cow $i$ starts in position $i$.  You are told a set of $K$ positions $0=A
_1<A_2< \ldots< A_K<N$ that are "active", meaning the cows in these positions are the next to move ($1 \leq K \leq N$).

In each minute of the dance, two things happen.  First, the cows in the active positions rotate: the cow at position $A_1$ moves to position $A_2$, the cow at p
osition $A_2$ moves to position $A_3$, and so on, with the cow at position $A_K$ moving to position $A_1$.  All of these $K$ moves happen simultaneously, so the
 after the rotation is complete, all of the active positions still contain exactly one cow.  Next, the active positions themselves shift:
$A_1$ becomes $A_1+1$, $A_2$ becomes $A_2+1$, and so on (if $A_i = N-1$ for some active position, then $A_i$ circles back around to $0$).

Please calculate the order of the cows after $T$ minutes of the dance ($1\le T\le 10^9$).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $T$.

The second line contains $K$ integers representing the initial set of active positions
$A_1,A_2, \ldots A_K$.  Recall that $A_1 = 0$ and that these are given in increasing order.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the order of the cows after $T$ minutes, starting with the cow in position $0$, separated by
spaces.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3 4
0 2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 2 3 4 0

For the example above, here are the cow orders and $A$ for the first four
timesteps:


Initial, T = 0: order = [0 1 2 3 4], A = [0 2 3]
T = 1: order = [3 1 0 2 4]
T = 1: A = [1 3 4]
T = 2: order = [3 4 0 1 2]
T = 2: A = [2 4 0]
T = 3: order = [2 4 3 1 0]
T = 3: A = [3 0 1]
T = 4: order = [1 2 3 4 0]

SCORING:
Inputs 2-7: $N \leq 1000, T \leq 10000$Inputs 8-13: No additional constraints.

[2025-08-24T07:53:53] thinking

**Analyzing cow positions**

I need to find Q more directly. So, I’ll analyze the effect of one minute at time t. The active positions for each cow rotate as they move through their positio
ns. For each i, the cow at position (A_i + t) goes to the next position, but other cows remain unaffected. This creates a cyclic mapping. I’m curious if there's
 a closed form for Q based on these shifts, noting that each index will eventually pair with every gap during N shifts. I also want to explore how often a speci
fic position is active.
**Understanding cow movements**

Each position in A occurs exactly once for every index in the range of 0 to N-1. This means a position becomes active K times, once for each original index. Whe
n a cow moves from position x, the displacement D_i is determined by the difference between adjacent active positions, with a special case for the K-th displace
ment. Each time a position x is active, a cow moves to a new position based on D_i, but the overall effect on Q is complex due to the nature of cumulative displ
acements and the interaction of modular shifts between cows.
**Mapping cow rotations**

I’m thinking that Q results from the sequential application of layers, which is complex. A better idea might be tracking cow labels with offsets for local circu
lar rotations. I can represent circular positions as an array and use a binary array mask to mark active positions. By shifting the mask, I can identify which c
ows are active over time.

This shifts the focus to a static mapping function that defines how cows move based on their active positions, simplifying the overall process into a time-homog
eneous mapping. The rule only depends on position rather than time, which is a neat realization!
**Building transformation function**

I'm starting by initializing an array f with default values based on a simple modulo operation. I then update f using the positions in array A for the first K v
alues. Next, I create a power array for efficient access later.

I loop through the bit-length of T to apply transformations on an array u, computing powers of the transformation function along the way. Finally, I calculate t
he result depending on T, ensuring positional shifts stay within bounds. Everything seems set for printing the cow labels as strings, and I’ll make sure to wrap
 it up with appropriate file settings and a final patch application.

Here’s a Python 3 solution that:

- Transforms positions into a time-homogeneous state via u_t = pos_t–t.
- Builds a static mapping F on 0…N–1 capturing both rotation and shift.
- Uses repeated squaring to compute F^T in O(N log T) time and O(N) memory.
- Recovers final positions and prints the cow ordering.

The code is in `solution.py`. You can run it directly with your input.
