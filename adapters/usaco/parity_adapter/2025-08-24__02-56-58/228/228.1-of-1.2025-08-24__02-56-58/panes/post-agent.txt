[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Party Invitations [Travis Hance, 2012]

Farmer John is throwing a party and wants to invite some of his cows to
show them how much he cares about his herd.  However, he also wants to
invite the smallest possible number of cows, remembering all too well the
disaster that resulted the last time he invited too many cows to a party.

Among FJ's cows, there are certain groups of friends that are hard to
separate.  For any such group (say, of size k), if FJ invites at least k-1
of the cows in the group to the party, then he must invite the final cow as
well, thereby including the entire group.  Groups can be of any size and
may even overlap with each-other, although no two groups contain exactly
the same set of members.  The sum of all group sizes is at most 250,000.

Given the groups among FJ's cows, please determine the minimum number of
cows FJ can invite to his party, if he decides that he must definitely
start by inviting cow #1 (his cows are conveniently numbered 1..N, with N
at most 1,000,000).

PROBLEM NAME: invite

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N (the number of cows), and G
        (the number of groups).

* Lines 2..1+G: Each line describes a group of cows.  It starts with
        an integer giving the size S of the group, followed by the S
        cows in the group (each an integer in the range 1..N).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 4
2 1 3
2 3 4
6 1 2 3 4 6 7
4 4 3 2 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 cows and 4 groups.  The first group contains cows 1 and 3, and
so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of cows FJ can invite to his party.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

In addition to cow #1, FJ must invite cow #3 (due to the first group
constraint), cow #4 (due to the second group constraint), and also cow #2
(due to the final group constraint).

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T07:10:30] thinking

**Evaluating memory usage**

I'm considering an edge case with cow1 being the only member of its group. If we try to invite cow1 but it’s already marked as invited, we can skip it. Now, as
I implement the code, I’m thinking about optimizing memory use, especially since N can go up to 1e6. A list for each cow would take up a lot of space, so maybe
a dictionary would be better for cows in groups only. But I still need to track memberships for everyone involved.
**Optimizing data structures**

I’ve decided to use a default dictionary for cow_groups, where the keys are cow IDs in their respective groups. By implementing this, I can avoid having a huge
array. Using the BFS method, popping cows from the queue will allow me to iterate through only existing group memberships, making the memory footprint significa
ntly smaller.

An invited list of booleans might add around 8MB, which is acceptable. Since total memory usage is likely below 100MB, I think I'm on the right track for optimi
zing resources effectively. Now, let's focus on implementing the solution.

Here’s the complete solution workflow:

1. **Problem Restatement**
   We have N cows (numbered 1…N) and G “friend” groups. In any group of size k, if you invite k−1 of them, you must also invite the last one. Starting with cow
1 invited, determine how many cows end up invited after repeatedly applying this rule until no more invitations are forced.

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - Track for each group: its size, how many are invited so far, and the sum of IDs of the remaining (uninvited) members.
   - Map each cow to the groups it belongs to.
   - Initialize with cow 1 invited (and any singleton groups).
   - Use a BFS queue: whenever a cow is invited, update each of its groups’ invited counts and remaining sums.
   - When a group’s invited count reaches size−1, the remaining sum gives the ID of the only uninvited cow—invite them and enqueue.

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   read N, G
   for each group i:
     read size S and members[]
     store S, invited_count[i]=0, sum_remaining[i]=sum(members)
     for cow in members: cow_groups[cow].append(i)
   invited = [False]*(N+1)
   queue = deque()
   invite cow 1; queue.push(1); total=1
   for each group of size 1:
     let c = sum_remaining[i]
     if not invited[c]: invite and queue.push(c); total++
   while queue not empty:
     c = queue.pop()
     for each group i in cow_groups[c]:
       if invited_count[i] >= size[i]: continue
       invited_count[i]++; sum_remaining[i] -= c
       if invited_count[i] == size[i]-1:
         other = sum_remaining[i]
         if not invited[other]:
           invite other; queue.push(other); total++
   print total
   ```

4. **Solution File**
   The code is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with:
