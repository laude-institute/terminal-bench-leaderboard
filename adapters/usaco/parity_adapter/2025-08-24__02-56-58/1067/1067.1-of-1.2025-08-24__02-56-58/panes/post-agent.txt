[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's largest pasture can be regarded as a large 2D grid of square
"cells" (picture a huge chess board).  Currently, there are $N$ cows occupying
some of these cells ($1 \leq N \leq 200$).

Farmer John wants to build a fence that will enclose a square region of cells;
the square must be oriented so its sides are parallel with the $x$  and $y$
axes, and it could be as small as a single cell.  Please help him count the
number of distinct subsets of cows that he can enclose in such a region.  Note
that the empty subset should be counted as one of these.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains a single integer $N$.  Each of the next $N$ lines Each
of the next $N$ lines contains two space-separated integers,  indicating the
$(x,y)$ coordinates of a cow's cell.  All $x$ coordinates are distinct from
each-other, and all $y$ coordinates are distinct from each-other.  All $x$ and
$y$ values lie in the range $0 \ldots 10^9$.

Note that although the coordinates of cells with cows are nonnegative, the
square fenced area might possibly extend into cells with negative coordinates.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The number of subsets of cows that FJ can fence off. It can be shown that this
quantity fits within a signed 32-bit integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
0 2
2 3
3 1
1 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
14

In this example, there are $2^4$ subsets in total. FJ cannot create a fence enclosing only cows 1
and 3, or only cows 2 and 4, so the answer is $2^4-2=16-2=14$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
16
17 4
16 13
0 15
1 19
7 11
3 17
6 16
18 9
15 6
11 7
10 8
2 1
12 0
5 18
14 5
13 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
420

SCORING:
In test cases 1-5, all coordinates of cells containing cows are less than
$20$.In test cases 6-10, $N\le 20$.In test cases 11-20, there are no additional constraints.

[2025-08-24T07:37:15] thinking

**Analyzing subsets of points**

I need to solve the problem of counting the number of subsets of points in a plane that are axis-aligned square-enclosable. We're dealing with up to N=200 point
s and distinct coordinates. It seems I need to count subsets that can be enclosed in an axis-aligned square, where that square may contain only the cows in the
subset. For example, with a sample input of 4 points, there are a total of 16 subsets to consider.
**Counting valid subsets**

I discovered that FJ can't create a fence that only encloses cows 1 and 3 or cows 2 and 4, leading to a count of 14 valid subsets instead of 16. The coordinates
 of cows 1 and 3 create a bounding rectangle that can't avoid capturing other cows if a square includes them. However, an empty subset can be fenced off by plac
ing a tiny square in an infinite plane that contains no cows. To count valid subsets, I can consider combinatorial methods rather than brute force possibilities
, which are impractical with N≤200.
**Counting square-contiguous subsets**

I need to count distinct subsets of points that can fit within a square defined by certain boundaries. The approach involves sorting points by their x-coordinat
es, compressing the coordinates, and then analyzing these in a grid format. Essentially, I want to determine if points are within a defined distance in both the
 x and y directions. However, I realize the complexity of the problem increases significantly with N=200, making a naive O(N^4) approach impractical. Exploring
dynamic programming or combinatorial counting seems necessary to efficiently find valid subsets.
**Counting subarrays in windows**

I need to count the number of subarrays where the y-coordinate differences meet a certain criteria. Using a two-pointer technique, I can keep track of valid pai
rs while iterating through a sorted list of y-ranks. This approach allows me to maintain efficiency, limiting the operations needed for each window. I’m also co
nsidering using a boolean array to handle which points are outside the current subset. My plan involves careful tracking of counts in a dynamic fashion, ensurin
g that I accurately capture unique subsets without missing any. Time complexity should remain manageable even with the upper limits.

I’ve implemented the described two‐pointer solution in `solution.py`. It reads input, compresses Y coordinates, and for each X‐window counts valid subsets via a
 sliding‐window over Y, summing results in O(N³). Let me know if you’d like to run tests or see any further explanation!
