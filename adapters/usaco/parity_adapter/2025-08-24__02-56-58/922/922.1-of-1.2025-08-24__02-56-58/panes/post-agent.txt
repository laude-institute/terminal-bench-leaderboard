[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie and Elsie are helping Farmer John wash the dishes, a more complicated
process than one might think due to their lack of opposable thumbs.

The two cows decide that Bessie will apply soap, and Elsie will rinse. Bessie is
given a dirty stack of plates labeled $1$ through $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$)
Elsie has an empty stack, where clean plates will go. There is a counter in
between Bessie and Elsie for soapy stacks.

At each step, either:

Bessie takes a plate from the top of the dirty stack, applies soap, and then
places it on the counter. When placing a soapy plate on the counter, Bessie must
either (i) place the plate on top of an existing non-empty soapy stack or (ii)
create a new soapy stack to the right of all existing soapy stacks.

Elsie takes a plate from the top of the leftmost soapy stack. Elsie rinses the
plate, then places it on top of the clean stack.

The goal is for the clean stack to have all plates in order, with the smallest
label on the bottom and the largest label on the top.  It may not be possible
for the cows to achieve this goal for the entire stack of plates, so please
determine the length of the largest prefix of the input ordering for which the
goal is achievable.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next $N$ lines specify the order of
the dishes in Bessie's stack, with the first number being the dish on top of the
stack.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please output the length of the longest prefix of the input stack that can be
successfully washed so that the plates end up ordered properly in the clean
stack.

**Analyzing the Dish Washing Problem**

I’m thinking we can write a file without needing approval. I want to create a solution for the "Dish Washing" problem from USACO, where we determine the maximum
 prefix length for processing. Bessie pushes items onto stacks while Elsie pops from the leftmost stack, and I need to ensure the stack ends up clean and sorted
 in ascending order. This involves checking if the prefix is “stack-sortable,” which hints at partitioning into non-increasing sequences. It’s crucial to see if
 we can generate the increasing sequence \(1 \ldots k\) by merging stacks.
**Exploring Patience Sorting for Prefixes**

I’m focused on finding the largest prefix where patience sorting works. The rule is to place each item on an existing pile if its top is greater than \(x\); oth
erwise, I create a new pile. This creates a greedy algorithm for identifying valid prefixes. Bessie generates stacks of soapy plates and, while processing each,
 must decide where to place a plate. It’s about determining when we can still achieve a sorted order. I’m considering using a deque to maintain stacks efficient
ly, as only the top value really matters for rinsing. For each plate, I’ll manage popping and pushing actions based on these rules.
**Determining Valid Plate Processing**

I’m working on keeping track of the tops of each stack while pushing plates. When we push onto a pile, we update the top and its contents. Popping decreases the
 stack's content too. Given the constraints, I need to be efficient. For pushing, I can use binary search on an array of current tops to find the right pile.

While processing each plate, I must rinse as much as possible after pushing. If after rinsing, the top of the first pile matches the expected next plate, I can
pop from there. The goal is to ensure that at the end, I have rinsed plates in sorted order. To find the largest achievable prefix, I need to check if the expec
ted count matches after processing. If it doesn’t, I’ve hit a failure point.

**Restatement**
- We have a sequence of plates with labels 1…N.
- Bessie pushes plates one by one onto “soapy” stacks (choose an existing stack whose top > label, or start a new rightmost stack).
- Elsie repeatedly pops from the top of the leftmost soapy stack whenever that plate’s label is the next expected in sorted order (1,2,3,…), building a clean st
ack.
- We want the longest prefix of the input such that after processing that prefix (with any interleaving of rinses), Elsie can have built the clean stack in incr
easing order for exactly that many plates.

**Approach**
- Simulate Bessie’s pushes via a variant of patience sorting: maintain piles’ tops in a list `tops` for binary search.
- Keep full piles in a list `piles` so that when the leftmost pile’s top matches the next-needed label, we can pop it (Elsie rinses).
- Track `next_needed` (starting at 1) and the best prefix length `best`.
- After each push and subsequent maximal rinses, if we have rinsed exactly `i+1` plates (for the i-th input), record `best = i+1`.
- At the end, print `best`.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read array plates of length N
initialize empty list piles, empty list tops
next_needed = 1
best = 0

for i from 0 to N-1:
    x = plates[i]
    # Bessie’s push via bisect_right on tops
    j = first index in tops with tops[j] > x (or len if none)
    if j < len(piles):
        push x onto piles[j], set tops[j]=x
    else:
        append new pile [x], tops.append(x)

    # Elsie’s rinses
    while piles non-empty and piles[0].top == next_needed:
        pop from piles[0], next_needed++
        if piles[0] empty: remove piles[0] and tops[0]
        else: update tops[0] to new top

    if next_needed-1 == i+1:
        best = i+1

print(best)
```
