[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Empty Stalls [Brian Dean, 2013]

Farmer John's new barn consists of a huge circle of N stalls (2 <= N <=
3,000,000), numbered 0..N-1, with stall N-1 being adjacent to stall 0.

At the end of each day, FJ's cows arrive back at the barn one by one, each
with a preferred stall they would like to occupy.  However, if a cow's
preferred stall is already occupied by another cow, she scans forward
sequentially from this stall until she finds the first unoccupied stall,
which she then claims.  If she scans past stall N-1, she continues scanning
from stall 0.

Given the preferred stall of each cow, please determine the smallest index
of a stall that remains unoccupied after all the cows have returned to the
barn.  Notice that the answer to this question does not depend on the order
in which the cows return to the barn.

In order to avoid issues with reading huge amounts of input, the input to
this problem is specified in a concise format using K lines (1 <= K <=
10,000) each of the form:

X Y A B

One of these lines specifies the preferred stall for XY total cows: X cows
prefer each of the stalls f(1) .. f(Y), where f(i) = (Ai + B) mod N.  The
values of A and B lie in the range 0...1,000,000,000.

Do not forget the standard memory limit of 64MB for all problems.

PROBLEM NAME: empty

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line contains integers X Y A B, interpreted as
        above.  The total number of cows specified by all these lines
        will be at most N-1.  Cows can be added to the same stall by
        several of these lines.

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 3
3 2 2 4
2 1 0 1
1 1 1 7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 10 stalls in the barn, numbered 0..9.  The second line of input
states that 3 cows prefer stall (2*1+4) mod 10 = 6, and 3 cows prefer stall
(2*2+4) mod 10 = 8.  The third line states that 2 cows prefer stall (0*1+1)
mod 10 = 1.  Line four specifies that 1 cow prefers stall (1*1+7) mod 10 =
8 (so a total of 4 cows prefer this stall).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum index of an unoccupied stall.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

All stalls will end up occupied except stall 5.

**Simulating next available stalls**

I'm working on a method to simulate the "first free successor" using union-find or a next pointer approach. A classic solution involves using a data structure w
ith path compression and an array to track the next available slot. For each cow wanting a stall, we find the root and occupy it, wrapping around using modulus.
 I need to efficiently process input that defines how many cows prefer certain stalls while considering the constraints based on total cows and stall preference
s.
**Optimizing union-find structure**

I'm considering a union-find structure to manage stall occupancy, ensuring that the total of \(X \times Y\) remains less than or equal to \(N-1\), which is a ma
ximum of around 3 million. For each stall \(f(i)\) with the same preference, I'll do union-find operations multiple times—specifically, \(X\) times. I need to e
stablish a parent array to track the next free slot, ensuring it handles circular occupancy by mapping to zero when necessary. I’ll define the process and imple
ment path compression for efficiency.
**Implementing the solution**

I'm outlining a solution to find the minimum free stall for cows using a union-find approach. After processing all cows, I need to find the smallest index where
 a stall is unoccupied by checking if each stall points to itself. I’ll manage memory efficiently by using a smaller data structure, like an array of unsigned i
ntegers, since the parent array could take up too much space in Python. I can optimize the I/O to handle up to 10,000 lines of input with large values efficient
ly. I'll create a structured output that includes restatement, conceptualization, pseudocode, and the final code.
**Structuring the solution**

I’m preparing to create a clear output divided into four parts: **Restatement**, **Solution Concept**, **Pseudocode**, and **solution.py**. I'll ensure the code
 is formatted in monospace within a code block for readability. For the three sections that precede the solution file creation, I’ll include the required inform
ation while also making a note to use section headers for clarity.

Once I've written the text, I’ll proceed to generate the solution.py file and apply the appropriate update.

**1. Restatement**

We have a circle of N stalls (0…N−1). Each cow has a preferred stall; if that stall is taken, she moves forward (wrapping around) to the next free stall and occ
upies it. Given groups of cows with their preferred stalls defined compactly, we must determine the smallest stall index left unoccupied once all cows have arri
ved.

**2. Solution Concept**

- Precompute, for each cow group, exactly which stalls they prefer (total preferences ≤ N−1).
- Use a disjoint-set-union (DSU) “next-free” structure over 0…N (where N acts as a sentinel that wraps to 0).
- For each cow preferring stall s:
  - Find the DSU root of s; if it’s N, wrap to find(0).
  - Occupy that root, then union it with root+1 to skip it in future.
- After seating all cows, scan from 0 upwards; the first i where find(i)==i is the smallest free stall.

This runs in O((#cows)·α(N)+N·α(N)), uses an array of size N+1, and fits in 64 MB by using a C-array of unsigned ints.

**3. Pseudocode**

```
read N, K
initialize DSU parent[0..N] = itself
for each of K lines:
    read X, Y, A, B
    curr = (A + B) mod N
    for i in 1..Y:
        stall = curr
        curr = (curr + A) mod N
        repeat X times:
            root = find(stall)
            if root == N:
                root = find(0)
            union(root, root+1)
for i in 0..N-1:
    if find(i) == i:
        print(i)
        exit
```

Next, I’ll create `solution.py` with the full Python implementation.
