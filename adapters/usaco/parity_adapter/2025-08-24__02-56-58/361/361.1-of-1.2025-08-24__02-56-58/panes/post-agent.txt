[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Milk Scheduling [Traditional, 2011]

Farmer John has N cows that need to be milked (1 <= N <= 10,000), each of
which takes only one unit of time to milk.

Being impatient animals, some cows will refuse to be milked if Farmer
John waits too long to milk them.  More specifically, cow i produces g_i
gallons of milk (1 <= g_i <= 1000), but only if she is milked before a
deadline at time d_i (1 <= d_i <= 10,000).  Time starts at t=0, so at most
x total cows can be milked prior to a deadline at time t=x.

Please help Farmer John determine the maximum amount of milk that he can
obtain if he milks the cows optimally.

PROBLEM NAME: msched

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The value of N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integers g_i and d_i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
10 3
7 5
8 1
2 1

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 cows.  The first produces 10 gallons of milk if milked by time
3, and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of gallons of milk Farmer John can
        obtain.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

25

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Farmer John milks cow 3 first, giving up on cow 4 since she cannot be
milked by her deadline due to the conflict with cow 3.  Farmer John then
milks cows 1 and 2.

**Evaluating scheduling solution**

The user wants a Python 3 solution for a scheduling problem with deadlines and weights, aiming to maximize total weight with unit tasks. Essentially, I'd use a
greedy approach to schedule tasks.

I could sort tasks by milk amounts or deadlines, using a min-heap to manage weights. If the min-heap size exceeds the deadline, I’d pop the smallest weight. Thi
s should yield the maximum weight efficiently while staying within constraints. The user mentioned a problem size of up to 10,000, which is manageable!
**Designing the solution**

To tackle the problem, I'll start by parsing the input and reading the number of tasks and their values. The plan involves sorting the tasks by deadline. As I i
terate through the sorted list, I’ll push the milk amounts into a min-heap. If the heap exceeds the size of the deadline, I’ll remove the smallest amount.

So, the main goal is to maximize total milk by scheduling tasks while respecting deadlines. I’ll prepare clear pseudocode for this, then write the solution in a
 Python file named `solution.py`. The user has requested all the necessary steps, and it makes sense to follow through systematically!

1. Problem Restatement
Farmer John has N cows, each taking 1 unit of time to milk and producing g_i gallons if milked by its deadline d_i. Time advances in integer units, and at most
t cows can be milked by time t. Maximize the total milk collected by scheduling at most one cow per time unit before its individual deadline.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Sort cows by their deadlines (earliest first).
- Traverse this sorted list, and maintain a min-heap of milk yields for the cows we choose to milk.
- For each cow, tentatively add its yield to the heap.
- If the heap size exceeds the current cow’s deadline (i.e., we’ve scheduled more cows than available time slots), remove the smallest-yielding cow from the hea
p.
- After processing all cows, the heap contains the optimal set, and its sum is the maximum milk.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N
read list of (g, d) pairs
sort cows by d ascending
initialize empty min-heap
for each (d, g) in sorted cows:
    push g onto heap
    if heap size > d:
        pop smallest from heap
answer = sum of heap elements
print answer
```

4. Implementation saved to `solution.py`.
