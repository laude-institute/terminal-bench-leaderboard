[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Times17 [Brian Dean, 2012]

After realizing that there is much money to be made in software
development, Farmer John has launched a small side business writing short
programs for clients in the local farming industry.

Farmer John's first programming task seems quite simple to him -- almost
too simple: his client wants him to write a program that takes a number N
as input, and prints 17 times N as output.  Farmer John has just finished
writing this simple program when the client calls him up in a panic and
informs him that the input and output both must be expressed as binary
numbers, and that these might be quite large.

Please help Farmer John complete his programming task.  Given an input
number N, written in binary with at most 1000 digits, please write out the
binary representation of 17 times N.

PROBLEM NAME: times17

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N (at most 1000 digits).

SAMPLE INPUT:

10110111

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The binary representation of N times 17.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

110000100111

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The binary number 10110111 is equal to 183 in decimal form.
183 x 17 = 3111 is 110000100111 in binary format.

**Conceptualizing Python solution**

The user needs a Python 3 solution that involves several steps: restating the problem, conceptualizing a solution, drafting pseudocode, and then saving it as so
lution.py. The task requires multiplying a binary string by 17 and outputting the result as a binary string. Python handles large integers, so I could simply co
nvert the binary string to an integer, multiply, and convert it back. However, I can also implement bitwise operations for safety. String manipulation could wor
k too, but using Python's big integers is the simplest approach while demonstrating algorithmic thinking.
**Conceptualizing the solution process**

I need to provide a complete response for the user that includes a problem restatement, conceptual solution, pseudocode, and saving it as solution.py. The task
involves taking a binary string, representing a number, and outputting its binary representation when multiplied by 17. I could use either integer conversion or
 pure string manipulation, like shifting and binary addition, though conversion might be simpler. So I'll write out the reasoning steps clearly before implement
ing the code to create the solution file.
**Creating the solution file**

I’ve decided to use integer conversion for the simplest approach to multiply a binary string by 17. So, my plan is to read the input string, convert it to an in
teger, multiply it by 17, and print the result as a binary string. I’ll write this up in the solution.py file. Here’s the code I'll implement:

```python
import sys
def main():
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    n = int(s, 2)
    print(format(n*17, 'b'))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now I’ll go ahead and create the solution.py file.

1. Restatement:
- Given a binary string N (up to 1000 bits), output its product with 17 as a binary string.

2. Conceptual Solution:
- Read the input as a binary string.
- Convert it to a Python integer.
- Multiply by 17.
- Convert the result back to a binary string and print.

3. Pseudocode:
```
read s from stdin
n = int(s, base=2)
m = n * 17
print binary representation of m without prefix
```

I’ve created `solution.py` implementing this. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
