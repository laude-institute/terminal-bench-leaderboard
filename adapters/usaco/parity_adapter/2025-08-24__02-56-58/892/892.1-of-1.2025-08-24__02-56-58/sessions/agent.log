[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is attempting to sort his $N$ cows ($1 \leq N \leq 100$),
conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, before they head out to the pastures for
breakfast.

Currently, the cows are standing in a line in the order
$p_1, p_2, p_3,
\dots, p_N$, and Farmer John is standing in front of cow $p_1$.
He wants to reorder the cows so that they are in the order $1, 2, 3, \dots, N$,
with cow $1$ next to Farmer John.

The cows are a bit sleepy today, so at any point in time the only cow who is
paying attention to Farmer John's instructions is the cow directly facing Farmer
John. In one time step, he can instruct this cow to move $k$ paces down the
line, for any $k$ in the range $1 \ldots N-1$. The $k$ cows whom she passes will
amble forward, making room for her to insert herself in the line after them.

For example, suppose that $N=4$ and the cows start off in the following order:

 FJ: 4, 3, 2, 1 
The only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $4$. If he instructs her to move $2$
paces down the line, the order will subsequently look like this:

 FJ: 3, 2, 4, 1 
Now the only cow paying attention to FJ is cow $3$, so in the second time step
he may give cow $3$ an instruction, and so forth until the cows are sorted.

Farmer John is eager to complete the sorting, so he can go back to the farmhouse
for his own breakfast. Help him find the minimum number of time steps required
to sort the cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers,

**Analyzing cow sorting problem**

I’m considering how to sort cows numbered from 1 to N, starting with them in a specific order and having to find the minimum number of moves. The head cow can be moved to various positions, but not left at the front. It feels similar to sorting through repeated insertions. I wonder if I should evaluate the longest increasing prefix or the longest sorted suffix to minimize steps. I need more clarity on determining the minimal operations for achieving this sorted order.
**Exploring sorting strategy**

At each step, I remove the head cow and can insert it anywhere after position k, where k is at least 1. This is like an insertion sort, but with the limitation of only taking the front cow. It seems like it could relate to finding the longest increasing suffix that's already sorted. For instance, when N=4 and p=1 2 4 3, I need to sort it to 1 2 3 4. 

If the head cow is already correct in position, can I leave it? I have to move the head cow each time, even if it seems sorted. This suggests that the optimal strategy might be to focus on moving the number 1 to the front and continuing with the next cows, prioritizing their correct order while considering the longest sorted suffix in reverse.
**Optimizing cow sorting operations**

I'm thinking about preserving a sorted suffix of cows at the end so they won't need to be moved. If the end cows are in order, I can avoid touching them. The goal is to minimize operations by identifying the longest sorted suffix and counting moves needed for others. 

Also, I need to consider that removing any cow, except the head, and inserting it at the front is equivalent to the operation I’m allowed. It makes me feel like I'm working through a sorting problem similar to pancake flips, where I want to reach a sorted order while minimizing my steps. The key lies in calculating the minimal moves necessary to achieve the desired order without unnecessary repositioning of sorted elements.
**Clarifying sorting steps**

I realize that the operations I perform when sorting are reversible, meaning the minimum forward operations are equal to the minimum backward ones. So, the goal of transforming the sorted array into the given array can be approached by counting the necessary moves.

To find the minimum moves, I start from the end of the array and check if the positions correspond to the expected sorted order. If they don't, I count a move. The main insight is that I'm looking for the longest increasing suffix, so I can calculate how many elements I don't need to move. I'll refine this approach through examples to ensure I'm on the right track.
**Testing sorting algorithm**

First, I need to confirm if my operations for sorting are correct. For the initial array of [4, 1, 2, 3], moving the head element (4) to the right can sort it in one move. However, for the array [1, 3, 2, 4], it's clear I'll need two moves. 

From my analysis, I realize I should look for the longest increasing suffix. If the elements maintain an increasing order, I can count them. I'll refine and implement this algorithm in Python, focusing on finding that increasing suffix to determine the minimal moves needed to sort the array.

At each step, I remove the head cow and can insert it anywhere after position k, where k is at least 1. This is like an insertion sort, but with the limitation of only taking the front cow. It seems like it could relate to finding the longest increasing suffix that's already sorted. For instance, when N=4 and p=1 2 4 3, I need to sort it to 1 2 3 4. 

If the head cow is already correct in position, can I leave it? I have to move the head cow each time, even if it seems sorted. This suggests that the optimal strategy might be to focus on moving the number 1 to the front and continuing with the next cows, prioritizing their correct order while considering the longest sorted suffix in reverse.

**Optimizing cow sorting operations**

I'm thinking about preserving a sorted suffix of cows at the end so they won't need to be moved. If the end cows are in order, I can avoid touching them. The goal is to minimize operations by identifying the longest sorted suffix and counting moves needed for others. 

Also, I need to consider that removing any cow, except the head, and inserting it at the front is equivalent to the operation I’m allowed. It makes me feel like I'm working through a sorting problem similar to pancake flips, where I want to reach a sorted order while minimizing my steps. The key lies in calculating the minimal moves necessary to achieve the desired order without unnecessary repositioning of sorted elements.

**Clarifying sorting steps**

I realize that the operations I perform when sorting are reversible, meaning the minimum forward operations are equal to the minimum backward ones. So, the goal of transforming the sorted array into the given array can be approached by counting the necessary moves.

To find the minimum moves, I start from the end of the array and check if the positions correspond to the expected sorted order. If they don't, I count a move. The main insight is that I'm looking for the longest increasing suffix, so I can calculate how many elements I don't need to move. I'll refine this approach through examples to ensure I'm on the right track.

**Testing sorting algorithm**

First, I need to confirm if my operations for sorting are correct. For the initial array of [4, 1, 2, 3], moving the head element (4) to the right can sort it in one move. However, for the array [1, 3, 2, 4], it's clear I'll need two moves. 

From my analysis, I realize I should look for the longest increasing suffix. If the elements maintain an increasing order, I can count them. I'll refine and implement this algorithm in Python, focusing on finding that increasing suffix to determine the minimal moves needed to sort the array.

I’ve implemented a straightforward scan for the longest increasing suffix and computed the minimal moves as the remaining prefix length. The solution reads from stdin and prints the move count. Let me know if you'd like test cases or further explanation!
