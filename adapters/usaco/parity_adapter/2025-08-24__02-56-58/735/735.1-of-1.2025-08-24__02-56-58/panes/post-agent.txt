[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John has lost his prize cow Bessie, and he needs to find her!

Fortunately, there is only one long path running across the farm, and Farmer
John knows that Bessie has to be at some location on this path.  If we think of
the path as a number line, then Farmer John is currently at position $x$ and
Bessie is currently at position $y$ (unknown to Farmer John).  If Farmer John
only knew where Bessie was located, he could walk directly to her, traveling a
distance of $|x - y|$.  Unfortunately, it is dark outside and Farmer John can't
see anything.  The only way he can find Bessie is to walk back and forth until
he eventually reaches her position.

Trying to figure out the best strategy for walking back and forth in his search,
Farmer John consults the computer science research literature and is
somewhat amused to find that this exact problem has not only been studied by
computer scientists in the past, but that it is actually called the "Lost Cow
Problem" (this is actually true!).

The recommended solution for Farmer John to find Bessie is to move to position
$x+1$, then reverse direction and move to position $x-2$, then to position
$x+4$, and so on, in a  "zig zag" pattern, each step moving twice as far from
his initial starting position as before.  As he has read during his study of algorithms
for solving the lost cow problem, this approach guarantees that he will at worst
travel 9 times the direct distance $|x-y|$ between himself and Bessie before he
finds her (this is also true, and the factor of 9 is actually the smallest such
worst case guarantee any strategy can achieve).

Farmer John is curious to verify this result.  Given $x$ and $y$, please compute
the  total distance he will travel according to the zig-zag search strategy above
until he finds Bessie.

INPUT FORMAT:
The single line of input contains two distinct space-separated integers $x$ and
$y$.  Both are in the range $0 \ldots 1,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print one line of output, containing the distance Farmer John will travel to
reach Bessie.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 6
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
9

**Addressing the Lost Cow Problem**

The user wants to tackle a typical USACO "Lost Cow" problem with a structured four-part solution, which includes restating the problem, conceptualizing a soluti
on, writing pseudocode, and implementing it in a file named `solution.py`. I need to carefully restate the problem in clear terms, explain my conceptual plan, a
nd draft pseudocode in plain English. Finally, I’ll create the `solution.py` file for the implementation. I’ll ensure all parts are ready for the user’s needs.
**Planning the Solution for the Lost Cow Problem**

I'm thinking that I need to create a file named `solution.py`. The problem involves a farmer starting at position x trying to reach cow at position y by zigzagg
ing. He alternates directions, increasing his step size each time.

I need to keep track of the distance traveled and check if y lies between the current and target positions during each move. If it does, I calculate the distanc
e to y specifically instead of the target. My steps include restating the problem, conceptualizing the approach, writing pseudocode, and implementing the soluti
on in the file.

1. Restatement
- Farmer John starts at position `x` on a number line and needs to find Bessie at position `y`.
- He searches by walking to `x+1`, then back to `x-2`, then to `x+4`, doubling the distance each time and reversing direction, until he reaches `y`.
- We must compute the total distance he travels.

2. Conceptual Approach
- Track FJ’s current position (`current`) and a running total of distance traveled.
- Generate successive “targets” at `x + (±step)`, where `step` doubles each iteration (1, 2, 4…) and the sign alternates.
- For each segment, check if `y` lies between the start and end of that segment:
  - If yes, add only the distance up to `y` and stop.
  - Otherwise, add the full segment length, update `current` to the target, flip direction, and double `step`.

3. Pseudocode
```
read x, y
current ← x
total_distance ← 0
step ← 1
direction ← +1
loop:
    target ← x + direction * step
    if y is between current and target:
        total_distance += abs(current - y)
        break
    else:
        total_distance += abs(current - target)
        current ← target
        direction ← -direction
        step ← step * 2
print total_distance
```

4. Saved Implementation (solution.py)
The file `solution.py` has been created with the above logic. You can run it with Python 3, providing `x` and `y` on standard input.
