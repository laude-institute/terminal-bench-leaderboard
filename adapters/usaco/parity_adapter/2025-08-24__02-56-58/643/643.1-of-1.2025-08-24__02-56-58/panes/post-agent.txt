[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow, always a fan of shiny objects, has taken up a hobby of mining
diamonds in her spare time!  She has collected $N$ diamonds ($N \leq 50,000$) of
varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in a pair of
display cases in the barn.

Since Bessie wants the diamonds in each of the two cases to be relatively similar in
size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the same case if their sizes
differ by more than $K$ (two diamonds can be displayed together in the same case if
their sizes differ by exactly $K$).  Given $K$, please help Bessie determine the
maximum number of diamonds she can display in both cases together.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq 1,000,000,000$).
The next $N$ lines each contain an integer giving the size of one of the
diamonds.  All sizes will be positive and will not exceed $1,000,000,000$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a single positive integer, telling the maximum number of diamonds that
Bessie can showcase in total in both the cases.

**Conceptualizing a diamond solution**

The user needs a Python 3 solution without external libraries for the "Diamond Collector" problem. First, I'll restate the problem: we want to find the maximum
number of diamonds that can be displayed in two cases, ensuring the size difference in each case is less than or equal to K.

Next, I’ll write pseudocode to frame the approach and then save the implementation to a file named solution.py. I’m curious if diamonds can overlap between case
s, so I’ll clarify that point as well while formulating the solution.
**Clarifying the diamond problem**

The USACO problem typically allows for disjoint sets in the two cases. The goal is to maximize the total count of diamonds across both cases, with each case hav
ing a maximal range of K. The classic solution involves sorting the sizes and using a two-pointer technique to define the largest valid window of diamonds start
ing at each index. I want to compute the maximum diamonds for different subsets and finally find the optimal combination using suffix maxima.

I'll implement this in an efficient manner, respecting the constraints on size and time complexity.

1. Problem Restatement
Bessie has N diamonds each with a positive size. She wants to place some into two separate display cases so that within each case, the difference between the sm
allest and largest diamond size is at most K. Find the maximum total number of diamonds she can display across both cases.

2. Solution Concept
- Sort the diamond sizes.
- For each starting index `l`, use a two‐pointer slide to find the largest window `[l…r-1]` where sizes differ by ≤K; record its size.
- Build a suffix array of the best window sizes from each index to the end.
- For each window starting at `l`, pair it with the best non‐overlapping window that begins at or after `r` and track the maximum sum.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K
read sizes[]
sort sizes
# right_size[l] = max count from l
r = 0
for l in 0…N-1:
    while r < N and sizes[r] - sizes[l] ≤ K:
        r += 1
    right_size[l] = r - l

# best_right[i] = max(right_size[i], best_right[i+1])
best_right[N] = 0
for i = N-1 down to 0:
    best_right[i] = max(right_size[i], best_right[i+1])

ans = 0
for l in 0…N-1:
    r = l + right_size[l]
    ans = max(ans, right_size[l] + best_right[r])

print(ans)
```

4. Implementation
The solution is saved in `solution.py`. It reads from standard input and prints the result.
