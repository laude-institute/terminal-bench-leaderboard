[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow was excited to recently return to in-person learning!
Unfortunately, her instructor, Farmer John, is a very boring lecturer, and so
she ends up falling asleep in class often.

Farmer John has noticed that Bessie has not been paying attention in class. He
has asked another student in class, Elsie, to keep track of the number of times
Bessie falls asleep in a given class. There are $N$ class periods
($1\le N\le 10^5$), and Elsie logs that Bessie fell asleep $a_i$ times
($0\le a_i\le 10^6$) in the $i$-th class period. The total number of times Bessie fell
asleep across all class periods is at most $10^6$.

Elsie, feeling very competitive with Bessie, wants to make Farmer John feel like
Bessie is consistently falling asleep the same number of times in every class --
making it appear that the issue is entirely Bessie's fault, with no dependence
on Farmer John's sometimes-boring lectures. The only way Elsie may modify the
log is by combining two adjacent class periods.  For example, if
$a=[1,2,3,4,5],$ then if Elsie combines the second and third class periods the
log will become $[1,5,4,5]$.

Help Elsie compute the minimum number of modifications to the log that she needs
to make so that she can make all the numbers in the log equal.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
Each input will contain $T$ ($1\le T\le 10$) test cases that should be solved
independently.

The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases to be solved. The $T$ test
cases follow, each described by a pair of lines. The first line of each pair
contains $N$, and the second contains $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$.

It is guaranteed that within each test case, the sum of all values in $a$ is at
most $10^6$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases is at
most
$10^5$.


OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Please write $T$ lines of output, giving the minimum number of modifications
Elsie could perform to make all the log entries equal for each case.

   1 2 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 1 1 1
-> 3 3 2 1
-> 3 3 3

   2 2 3

For the last test case, Elsie doesnâ€™t need to perform any operations; the log
already consists of equal entries.

[2025-08-24T07:23:01] thinking

**Analyzing array merging**

Iâ€™m thinking about a problem involving an array where I need to reduce its length by merging adjacent entries. The goal is to make all entries in the final list
 equal, aligning with a specific target value that divides into the total sum of the array. Each merge operation costs 1 and shortens the list by 1. I have to b
e careful to find if itâ€™s possible to create k segments that each equal an integer value derived from the total sum. It's an intriguing challenge!
**Exploring segment operations**

I'm considering how to calculate the number of operations needed when segmenting an array. Each segmentation requires merging lengths, which leads to a total co
st of N-k operations. The goal is to check if I can create k segments where the sum of each equals S/k. This means k must be a divisor of S. I'll use a greedy a
pproach to verify this, checking if sums match the target. I also need to consider edge cases, like when S is zero, allowing for some interesting scenarios. I w
ant to efficiently find possible k values without excessive computations.
**Implementing the solution**

Iâ€™m breaking down the problem into clear steps. First, Iâ€™ll restate it in plain English so it's understandable. Next, I need to conceptualize how to approach th
e solution effectively. Then, Iâ€™ll create pseudocode to outline the logic and plan how to structure it. Finally, Iâ€™ll implement the code in a file called soluti
on.py without using any extra libraries. I need to be careful about efficiently generating divisors in my code. After crafting the text steps, I will create the
 solution file. Sounds good!
**Writing the solution code**

Iâ€™m putting together the code now. The plan starts by reading all the input and parsing it efficiently. Iâ€™ll calculate the sum of the array and check if itâ€™s ze
ro, in which case Iâ€™ll return zero directly. Next, Iâ€™ll find the divisors of the sum and inspect each divisor to see if it satisfies the conditions. If it holds
, Iâ€™ll determine the number of segments and output the result. Once everything is set, I'll apply the patch to implement the solution. Let's get this done!

1. Problem restatement

We have an array of non-negative integers of length N whose elements sum to S. In one operation, we may merge two adjacent elements by replacing them with their
 sum, reducing the length by one. We want to make every remaining entry equal (so if there are k entries, each must be S/k). Compute the minimum operations need
ed.

2. Solution idea

- Merging costs 1 each, and to go from N entries to k entries always costs Nâˆ’k.
- We want to maximize k such that we can split the original array into k contiguous segments each summing to S/k.
- Equivalently, for each divisor v of S that is â‰¥ the maximum element, check greedily if we can cut segments of sum exactly v. The first such (smallest) v gives
 the largest k = S/v.
- Answer is N âˆ’ k. Special case S=0 â‡’ all zeros â‡’ no merges.

3. Pseudocode

```
read T
for each test case:
  read N and array a
  total = sum(a)
  if total == 0:
    print 0
    continue
  mx = max(a)
  find all divisors of total, sort ascending
  for each divisor v in divisors:
    if v < mx: skip
    curr = 0
    valid = true
    for x in a:
      curr += x
      if curr > v:
        valid = false; break
      if curr == v:
        curr = 0
    if valid and curr == 0:
      k = total / v
      break
  print N âˆ’ k
```

4. Implementation

The solution has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
