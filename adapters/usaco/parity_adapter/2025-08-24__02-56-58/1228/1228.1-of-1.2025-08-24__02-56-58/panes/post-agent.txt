[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Bessie the cow is hiding somewhere along the number line. Each of Farmer John's
$N$ other cows ($1\le N\le 1000$) have a piece of information to share: the
$i$-th cow either says that Bessie is hiding at some location less than or equal
to $p_i$, or that Bessie is hiding at some location greater than or equal to
$p_i$
($0\le p_i\le 10^9$).

Unfortunately, it is possible that no hiding location is consistent with the
answers of all of the cows, meaning that not all of the cows are telling the
truth.  Count the minimum number of cows that must be lying.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$.

The next $N$ lines each contain either L or G, followed by an integer $p_i$. L
means that the $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location is less than  or
equal to $p_i$, and G means that $i$-th cow says that Bessie's hiding location
is greater than or equal to $p_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The minimum number of cows that must be lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
0

It is possible that no cow is lying.

SAMPLE INPUT:
2
G 3
L 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

At least one of the cows must be lying.

**Analyzing cow statements**

I'm working through a problem involving N cows giving statements about Bessie's location. Each statement indicates whether a position x should be greater than o
r less than a certain value. To find the x that satisfies the maximum number of statements, I realize I need to minimize the liars. Essentially, I’ll consider h
ow many cows tell the truth based on the chosen x and adjust accordingly—counting the liars for each segment on the number line to pinpoint the best x.
**Exploring candidate positions**

I'm considering N cows and their statements about Bessie's location, with N going up to 1000 and pi values reaching 1e9. I notice that the count of liars change
s only when x crosses a pi value, meaning potential candidate x positions are around these pi values. I’ll sort all the unique pi values into a list and evaluat
e them to find the best x, since if x equals pi, it satisfies both G pi and L pi statements. Between distinct pi values, the liar count remains stable, simplify
ing my evaluations.
**Creating solution file**

I'm gearing up to create a solution.py file to resolve a problem involving Bessie’s unknown position on a number line. First, I’ll outline the content, beginnin
g with a restatement of the problem in plain English, followed by a conceptual overview and pseudocode. The final output will include both the text responses an
d the code itself. I need to ensure that the code uses only standard libraries like bisect and reads input correctly. Let’s prepare everything step-by-step!

**Problem Restatement**
Bessie is hiding at an unknown point on a number line. Each of the N cows reports either “Bessie’s position ≥ pᵢ” or “Bessie’s position ≤ pᵢ.” Some reports may
conflict. We must find the smallest number of cows whose statements must be false to allow at least one hiding position.

**Solution Concept**
- Any chosen hiding position x makes a “G pᵢ” statement (x ≥ pᵢ) lie if x < pᵢ, and an “L pᵢ” statement (x ≤ pᵢ) lie if x > pᵢ.
- The lie count only changes when x crosses one of the reported pᵢ values.
- Test x at each distinct pᵢ: count lies using binary search on sorted lists of G and L positions, and track the minimum.

**Pseudocode**
- Read N and the N pairs (type, pᵢ).
- Split pᵢ into two lists: G_list for “G” and L_list for “L”.
- Sort both lists.
- Collect all distinct pᵢ as candidates.
- For each candidate x:
  - g_le = count of G_list ≤ x (via bisect_right)
  - g_lies = total_G − g_le
  - l_lt = count of L_list < x (via bisect_left)
  - l_lies = l_lt
  - liars = g_lies + l_lies
  - update minimum liars.
- Print the minimum.

Now creating **solution.py** with this implementation.
