[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Bessie Slows Down [Brian Dean, 2014]

Bessie the cow is competing in a cross-country skiing event at the winter
Moolympic games.  She starts out at a speed of 1 meter per second.
However, as she becomes more tired over time, she begins to slow down.
Each time Bessie slows down, her speed decreases: she moves at 1/2 meter
per second after slowing down once, then 1/3 meter per second after slowing
down twice, and so on.

You are told when and where Bessie slows down, in terms of a series of
events.  An event like this:

T 17

means that Bessie slows down at a specific time -- here, 17 seconds into
the race.  An event like this:

D 10

means that Bessie slows down at a specific distance from the start -- in
this case, 10 meters.

Given a list of N such events (1 <= N <= 10,000), please compute the amount
of time, in seconds, for Bessie to travel an entire kilometer.  Round your
answer to the nearest integer second (0.5 rounds up to 1).

PROBLEM NAME: slowdown

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The value of N.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line is of the form "T x" or "D x", indicating a
        time event or a distance event.  In both cases, x is an
        integer that is guaranteed to place the event before Bessie
        reaches one kilometer of total distance.  It is possible for
        multiple events to occur simultaneously, causing Bessie to
        slow down quite a bit all at once.  Events may not be listed
        in order.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
T 30
D 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie slows down at time t = 30 and at distance d = 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The total time required for Bessie to travel 1 kilometer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2970

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie travels the first 10 meters at 1 meter/second, taking 10 seconds.
She then slows down to 1/2 meter/second, taking 20 seconds to travel the
next 10 meters.  She then reaches the 30 second mark, where she slows down
again to 1/3 meter/second.  The remaining 980 meters therefore take her
980 * 3 = 2940 seconds.  The total time is therefore 10 + 20 + 2940 = 2970.

**Conceptualizing Python Solution**

The user is looking for a Python solution with clear reasoning. First, I need to restate the problem to ensure clarity, then conceptualize how to approach it. W
riting out the pseudocode will help outline the steps. After that, I can directly create the file `solution.py` without needing approval since it fits the works
pace-write guidelines. For the solution, I’ll simulate speed adjustments during time or distance events until the distance reaches 1000m, considering the impact
 of each slowdown event.
**Simulating Two-Dimensional Events**

I'm working on a two-dimensional event simulation with time, distance, and speed. I need to calculate the next time and distance events based on their respectiv
e differences. The first step is determining which event occurs first, updating time and distance accordingly, and managing speed adjustments based on slowdown
counts. Since multiple events can happen simultaneously, I'll create two sorted lists for both time and distance events to streamline processing. After reaching
 a total distance of 1000m, I’ll add the remaining stretch and round the time properly, implementing my rounding system.
**Outlining the Event Processing Steps**

I realize that if the time differences are shorter than distance differences, I need to handle multiple time events happening simultaneously. When processing a
time event, I should update my count based on how many events occur at that time. Sorting both time and distance events into lists will help streamline this. As
 I compute differences and compare them, I’ll maintain pointers to process the events efficiently. I need to outline my approach in pseudocode, implement it in
`solution.py`, and display the three sections for clarity. Let's start coding!

**1. Restatement**

Bessie skis 1000 m starting at 1 m/s. She receives “slow down” events, each either at a given elapsed time or when she has skied a given distance. Each slowdown
 increases her slowdown count by 1, making her current speed = 1 / (count + 1) m/s. Given N unordered events all before the finish line, compute how many second
s she takes to finish, rounded to the nearest integer (with .5 rounding up).

**2. Solution Concept**

- Read and sort time-based and distance-based events separately.
- Simulate her race from t=0, d=0, slows=0 (speed = 1/(slows+1)).
- At each step, look at the next time event and next distance event.
  - Compute time to the next time event: dt_time = (t_event – t_current).
  - Compute time to the next distance event: dt_dist = (d_event – d_current) / speed.
  - If the next event occurs after she’d finish the remaining distance, just finish and break.
  - Otherwise, advance to whichever event comes first (or both, if tied), update t and d, then increase slows by the number of simultaneous events at that insta
nt.
- After reaching 1000 m, round total time with “int(time + 0.5)”.

**3. Pseudocode**

```
read N
for each event:
  if type T: add to time_events
  else: add to dist_events
sort time_events, dist_events

t, d, slows = 0, 0, 0
i_t, i_d = 0, 0
target = 1000

while d < target:
  next_t = time_events[i_t] or INF
  next_d = dist_events[i_d] or INF
  speed = 1/(slows+1)

  dt_time = next_t - t
  dt_dist = (next_d - d)/speed if next_d> d else 0

  rem_d = target - d
  time_to_finish = rem_d / speed
  if min(dt_time, dt_dist) >= time_to_finish:
    t += time_to_finish
    break

  if dt_time < dt_dist:
    t += dt_time; d += speed*dt_time
    process all time_events at next_t: slows += count; i_t += count
  elif dt_dist < dt_time:
    t += dt_dist; d += (next_d - d)
    process all dist_events at next_d
  else:
    t += dt_time; d += speed*dt_time
    process all time_events at next_t and dist_events at next_d

print int(t + 0.5)
```

**4. Implementation**

The solution is saved in `solution.py`. You can run it with:

```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
