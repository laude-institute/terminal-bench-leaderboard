[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Lineup [Brian Dean and Daniel Dara, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are lined up in a row.  Each cow is
identified by an integer "breed ID" in the range 0...1,000,000,000; the
breed ID of the ith cow in the lineup is B(i).  Multiple cows can share the
same breed ID.

FJ thinks that his line of cows will look much more impressive if there is
a large contiguous block of cows that all have the same breed ID.  In order
to create such a block, FJ chooses up to K breed IDs and removes from his
lineup all the cows having those IDs.  Please help FJ figure out
the length of the largest consecutive block of cows with the same breed ID
that he can create by doing this.

PROBLEM NAME: lineup

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the breed ID B(i).

SAMPLE INPUT:

9 1
2
7
3
7
7
3
7
5
7

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 9 cows in the lineup, with breed IDs 2, 7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7, 5, 7.
FJ would like to remove up to 1 breed ID from this lineup.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The largest size of a contiguous block of cows with
        identical breed IDs that FJ can create.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

By removing all cows with breed ID 3, the lineup reduces to 2, 7, 7, 7, 7,
5, 7.  In this new lineup, there is a contiguous block of 4 cows with the
same breed ID (7).

**Evaluating contiguous blocks of breeds**

I've got this problem about removing up to K distinct breed IDs to maximize the length of the largest contiguous block of the same breed. It seems I want to foc
us on a target breed ID, X, and ensure that between the segments of X, there are at most K other breeds. If the distinct breeds are less than or equal to K, I c
an remove them to connect the X segments. However, I need to remember that this removal is global and affects the whole lineup. Interesting challenge!
**Analyzing breed segments**

I'm working with segments of a lineup to find the best way to maximize contiguous blocks of a target breed X, while only allowing up to K distinct other breeds
within a specified window. The strategy involves counting how many X’s are present in a chosen range and adjusting for the breeds I can remove. I wonder if usin
g a two-pointer technique with a sliding window would speed up the process, especially since looping through all distinct breeds could be slow with larger datas
ets. It's tricky to manage the distinct counts, but there has to be an efficient way to tackle this!
**Maximizing contiguous breeds**

I’m exploring how to remove up to K distinct breed IDs effectively to maximize contiguous blocks of a target breed X. In any given window, I need to ensure that
 only at most K non-target breeds are present. The approach involves using a sliding window and tracking counts of breeds within that window. The challenge is t
o efficiently determine which breeds to remove to connect segments of X while ensuring maximum counts of X. It’s getting complicated, but finding the optimal so
lution for each target breed will help clarify the best removal strategy!

1. Problem restated

Farmer John has a lineup of N cows labeled by breed IDs. He may choose up to K distinct breed IDs and remove all cows of those breeds. After removal, he wants t
he longest contiguous run of cows all sharing the same breed ID. Compute that maximum possible run length.

2. Solution idea
- Use a sliding window on the original lineup, keeping at most K+1 distinct breeds in the window.
- Any window with ≤K+1 distinct breeds can be turned into a single-breed block by removing the other ≤K breeds.
- Within each valid window, track which breed appears most often (its count); that count is the largest block you can get in this window.
- Slide the window in O(N), updating counts and distinct-breed totals, and maintain the maximum breed-count seen.

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, K and array B
l ← 0, ans ← 0
counts ← empty map (breed→count)
count_freq ← empty map (count→#breeds)
distinct ← 0, max_count ← 0

for r in 0..N-1:
    b = B[r]
    old = counts[b] or 0
    if old>0: decrement count_freq[old]
    else: distinct++
    new = old+1
    counts[b] = new
    increment count_freq[new]
    max_count = max(max_count,new)

    while distinct > K+1:
        b2 = B[l]
        c2 = counts[b2]
        decrement count_freq[c2]
        if c2==1:
            remove counts[b2]; distinct--
        else:
            counts[b2]=c2-1; increment count_freq[c2-1]
        l++
        while count_freq[max_count]==0: max_count--

    ans = max(ans, max_count)

print ans
```
