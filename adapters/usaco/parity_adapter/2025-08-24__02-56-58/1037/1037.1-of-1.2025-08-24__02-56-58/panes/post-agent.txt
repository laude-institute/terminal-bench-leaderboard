[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John is worried for the health of his cows (conveniently numbered
$1 \ldots N$ as always) after an outbreak of the  highly contagious bovine
disease COWVID-19.

Recently, Farmer John tested all of his cows and found some of them to be
positive for the disease.  Using video footage from inside his barn, he is able
to review recent interactions between pairs of cows --- it turns out that when
cows greet each-other, they shake hooves, a gesture that can unfortunately
spread the infection from one cow to another.  Farmer John assembles a
time-stamped list of interacting pairs of cows, with entries of the form
$(t, x, y)$, meaning that at time $t$, cow $x$ shook hooves with cow $y$.
Farmer John also knows the following:

(i) Exactly one cow on his farm could have started out carrying the disease
(we'll call this cow "patient zero").

(ii) Once a cow is infected, she passes the infection along with her next $K$
hoof shakes (possibly including the same partner cow several times).  After
shaking hooves $K$ times, she no longer passes the infection along with
subsequent hoof shakes (since at this point she realizes she is spreading the
infection and washes her hooves carefully).

(iii) Once a cow is infected, she stays infected.

Unfortunately, Farmer John doesn't know which of his $N$ cows is patient zero,
nor does he know the value of $K$!  Please help him narrow down the
possibilities for these unknowns based on his data. It is guaranteed that at
least one possibility is valid.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input file contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100$) and $T$
($1 \leq T \leq 250$).  The next line contains a string of length $N$ whose
entries are 0s and 1s,  describing the current state of Farmer John's $N$ cows
--- 0 represents a healthy cow and 1 represents a cow presently with the
disease.  Each of the next $T$ lines describes a record in Farmer John's list of
interactions and consists of three integers $t$, $x$, and $y$, where $t$ is a
positive integer time of the interaction ($t \leq 250$) and $x$ and $y$ are
distinct integers in the range $1 \ldots N$, indicating which cows shook hands
at time $t$. At most one interaction happens at each point in time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single line with three integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, where $x$ is the
number of possible cows who could have been patient zero, $y$ is the smallest
possible value of $K$ consistent with the data, and $z$ is the largest possible
value of $K$ consistent with the data (if there is no upper bound on $K$ that
can be deduced from the data, print "Infinity" for $z$). Note that it might be
possible to have $K=0$.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1100
7 1 2
5 2 3
6 2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1 1 Infinity

The only candidate for patient zero is cow 1. For all $K>0$, cow 1 infects cow 2
at time 7, while cows 3 and 4 remain uninfected.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T08:17:26] thinking

**Analyzing the infection spread**

I’m working through the USACO "Contact Tracing" problem variant with N cows and interactions sorted by timestamps, even though the input isn’t initially sorted.
 One cow starts infected; we simulate the infection spread based on interactions. Each cow has a transmission counter starting from K. If an infected cow shakes
 hooves and has remaining transmissions, they can infect another uninfected cow, which then gains its own K. It’s a bit tricky figuring out if the infection pas
ses on the next K shakes after becoming infected!
**Clarifying infection propagation**

The problem states that an infected cow can pass the infection with her next K hoof shakes. This means she can infect another cow on the first handshake post-in
fection. Each handshake counts, regardless of whether it leads to a new infection. If both cows shake hooves, they don’t re-infect, but the shake still counts t
oward their transmission limit. Essentially, if a cow's transmission counter is greater than zero, it decrements regardless of the partner's infection status. S
o, I need to ensure I'm correctly tracking the infection status with every handshake.
**Structuring the infection algorithm**

I’m clarifying the algorithm logic for the infection problem. If K=0, an infected cow can't transmit the infection. For any positive K, during a handshake, if t
he transmitting cow has remaining transmissions, it can infect an uninfected partner, then decrement its counter. If both cows are infected, no new infections o
ccur, but their counters still decrement.

I plan to simulate for each cow as patient zero, checking K values up to T, which is a safe cap since no cow can have more than T shakes. If the final infected
statuses match, I’ll record the valid K values and determine the global minimum and maximum K. It’s a solid plan for implementation!
**Drafting the infection simulation**

I’m designing the simulation function which checks infection spread. The infected list tracks each cow's status, while counts hold their remaining transmissions
. For each interaction, I’ll determine if an infected cow can successfully infect another. After assessing potential infections, I’ll decrement counts only if t
hey’re greater than zero.

Once the algorithm finishes simulating interactions, I’ll compare the resulting infected list to the final statuses, adjusting the results as I go. I need to pr
epare the problem statement, conceptual solution, and pseudocode before implementing solution.py. I’ll ensure everything is clear and formatted correctly!

Here’s the full solution:

1. **Restatement**
   We have N cows with final infection states. Exactly one cow was initially infected (“patient zero”) and each infected cow spreads the disease during its next
 K handshakes before washing. We have a timestamped list of T pairwise handshakes. We need to find how many cows could be patient zero, and the minimum and maxi
mum K consistent with the final infection data (with “Infinity” if no finite upper bound).

2. **Conceptual Solution**
   - For each candidate cow `p` as patient zero and each K from 0 to T:
     • Simulate the handshake events in chronological order, tracking which cows are infected and how many remaining infectious handshakes each has.
     • After each handshake, update infections and decrement counters.
     • At the end, check if the simulated infection pattern matches the observed final pattern.
   - Record all (p, K) pairs that match. Count valid patients `p`, take the overall minimum K, and if any valid K == T, the upper bound is infinite; otherwise t
ake the overall maximum.

3. **Pseudocode**
   ```
   read N, T
   read final_status string
   read T interactions; sort by time
   possible_initials = 0
   all_valid_Ks = []
   infinite = false

   for p in 1..N:
     valid_Ks = []
     for K in 0..T:
       simulate infection:
         infected = [false]*N; counters = [0]*N
         infected[p] = true; counters[p] = K
         for each handshake (t, x, y):
           decide if x infects y (infected[x] and counters[x]>0 and not infected[y])
           decide if y infects x similarly
           if counters[x]>0: counters[x]--
           if counters[y]>0: counters[y]--
           apply any new infections and reset their counters to K
       if infected == final_status:
         valid_Ks.append(K)
     if valid_Ks not empty:
       possible_initials++
       record min(valid_Ks) and max(valid_Ks)
       if max(valid_Ks) == T: infinite = true
   output possible_initials, overall_minK, (Infinity if infinite else overall_maxK)
   ```

4. **Implementation**
The solution is saved as `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```bash
python3 solution.py < input.txt
```
