[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Cow Race [Brian Dean, 2013]

In order to finally settle their long-running dispute over who is the
faster cow, Bessie and her friend Elsie decide to hold a race across the farm.

The two cows start at the same location and begin running in the same
direction at the same time.  The progress of each cow is described by a
series of "segments", during each of which the cow runs at a constant
speed.  For example, Bessie might run at a speed of 5 for 3 units of time,
then at a speed of 10 for 6 units of time.  Bessie and Elsie both run for
the same total amount of time.

The cows would like your help in counting the number of leadership changes
during their race.  A leadership change happens at a point in time when cow
A pulls into the lead of cow B, whereas the last time one cow was in the
lead, it was cow B.  For example, if B is in the lead and then A pulls
ahead, then this is a leadership change.  If B is in the lead, and then A
becomes even with B for some time and then finally pulls ahead, then this
also counts as a leadership change.

PROBLEM NAME: cowrace

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.  (1 <= N, M <= 1000)

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the N segments of Bessie's
        run, described by two integers: Bessie's speed and the amount
        of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in the range
        1..1000).

* Lines 2+N..1+N+M: Each line contains one of the M segments of
        Elsie's run, described by two integers: Elsie's speed and the
        amount of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in
        the range 1..1000).

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 3
1 2
4 1
1 1
2 10

1 2
3 9

INPUT DETAILS:

Bessie runs at a speed of 1 for 2 units of time, then at a speed of 4 for 1
unit of time, then at a speed of 1 for 1 unit of time, and finally at a
speed of 2 for 10 units of time.  Elsie runs at a speed of 2 for 3 units of
time, then at a speed of 1 for 2 units of time, then finally at a speed of
3 for 9 units of time.  Note that both cows run for a total of 14 units of
time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of leadership changes during the race.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Elsie is ahead until time t=3, when both cows meet after both have traveled
6 units of total distance and travel together for 1 unit of time.  Bessie
then pulls ahead briefly (the first leadership change), only to be
overtaken shortly thereafter by Elsie (the second leadership change).
Elsie ends the race in the lead.

[END PROBLEM]

[2025-08-24T07:45:11] thinking

**Planning Python solution**

The user is asking for a structured approach to a Python problem. First, I'll restate it: they want a program that simulates a race, measuring distances over ti
me and tracking lead changes between two segments.

Next, I'll conceptualize the solution: I will create a loop that runs second by second, updating distances for each segment.

Then, I can draft the pseudocode, outlining the steps clearly. Finally, I'll write the actual code and save it as solution.py, ensuring there are no outside lib
raries used. The time constraints seem manageable for this simulation.
**Refining the simulation strategy**

I’m considering a segment-by-segment approach to track position updates for two participants. Simulating per unit time seems more manageable despite the larger
loop size, as I can easily track position changes each second.

I realize I need to monitor changes in leadership carefully: a change counts when the relative position shifts from one leader to another or when participants t
ie. For example, if one goes from behind to ahead, it counts as a leadership change. I'll need to establish an initial state, where I'm tied at the start, and o
nly begin counting changes after someone pulls ahead.
**Structuring the simulation approach**

I’m clarifying the process for tracking leadership changes during the race simulation. It looks like I need to implement a mechanism that counts leadership tran
sitions correctly, especially when crossing from negative to positive, while ignoring ties at zero. I think it's best to keep track of the last non-zero leader
to ensure accurate counting.

I’ll set it up to read speed and time arrays for both participants, iterating through them as needed, while maintaining time pointers. The focus is to keep the
process efficient despite the potentially large loop count. Once that’s organized, I’ll draft textual restatements, conceptual explanations, and pseudocode befo
re finalizing the solution in a Python file.

Here’s the complete deliverable:

**Restatement**
Two cows (Bessie and Elsie) each run for the same total time, divided into segments of constant speed. We need to count how many times the lead switches from on
e cow to the other (passing through ties still counts as a switch).

**Conceptual Solution**
- Read and store each cow’s segments (speed, duration).
- Simulate the race one time unit at a time: update each cow’s position, move to the next segment when its duration expires.
- Track the “last non‐zero leader” and, whenever the other cow pulls strictly ahead (ignoring tie moments), increment the change counter.

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, M
read bessie_segments[0..N)
read elsie_segments[0..M)
initialize pointers, remaining times, speeds, positions
last_leader = 0  # 0=tie, 1=B, -1=E
lead_changes = 0
total_time = sum of Bessie’s durations

for t in 1..total_time:
    pos_b += spd_b
    pos_e += spd_e
    decrement rem_b, rem_e
    if rem_b == 0: advance Bessie’s segment
    if rem_e == 0: advance Elsie’s segment
    determine cur_leader = sign(pos_b - pos_e)
    if cur_leader != 0:
        if last_leader == 0:
            last_leader = cur_leader
        elif cur_leader != last_leader:
            lead_changes += 1
            last_leader = cur_leader

print lead_changes
```

I’ve saved the full implementation in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run more tests or discuss further optimizations!
