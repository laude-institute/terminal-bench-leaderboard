The progress of each cow is described by a\nseries of \"segments\", during each of which the cow runs at a constant\nspeed.  For example, Bessie might run at a speed of 5 for 3 units of time,\nthen at a speed of 10 for 6 units of time.  Bessie and Elsie both run for\nthe same total amount of time.\n\nThe cows would like your help in counting the number of leadership changes\nduring their race.  A leadership change happens at a point in time when cow\nA pulls into the lead of cow B, whereas the last time one cow was in the\nlead, it was cow B.  For example, if B is in the lead and then A pulls\nahead, then this is a leadership change.  If B is in the lead, and then A\nbecomes even with B for some time and then finally pulls ahead, then this\nalso counts as a leadership change.\n\nPROBLEM NAME: cowrace\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.  (1 <= N, M <= 1000)\n\n* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains one of the N segments of Bessie's\n        run, described by two integers: Bessie's speed and the amount\n        of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in the range\n        1..1000).\n\n* Lines 2+N..1+N+M: Each line contains one of the M segments of\n        Elsie's run, described by two integers: Elsie's speed and the\n        amount of time she runs at that speed (both integers are in\n        the range 1..1000).\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n\n4 3\n1 2\n4 1\n1 1\n2 10\n2 3\n1 2\n3 9\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nBessie runs at a speed of 1 for 2 units of time, then at a speed of 4 for 1\nunit of time, then at a speed of 1 for 1 unit of time, and finally at a\nspeed of 2 for 10 units of time.  Elsie runs at a speed of 2 for 3 units of\ntime, then at a speed of 1 for 2 units of time, then finally at a speed of\n3 for 9 units of time.  Note that both cows run for a total of 14 units of\ntime.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: The number of leadership changes during the race.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n2\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\nElsie is ahead until time t=3, when both cows meet after both have traveled\n6 units of total distance and travel together for 1 unit of time.  Bessie\nthen pulls ahead briefly (the first leadership change), only to be\novertaken shortly thereafter by Elsie (the second leadership change). \nElsie ends the race in the lead.\n\n[END PROBLEM]",
