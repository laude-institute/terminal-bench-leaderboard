[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 3: Moo Sick [Rob Seay]

Everyone knows that cows love to listen to all forms of music.  Almost all
forms, that is -- the great cow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Moozart
once discovered that a specific chord tends to make cows rather ill.  This
chord, known as the ruminant seventh chord, is therefore typically avoided
in all cow musical compositions.

Farmer John, not knowing the finer points of cow musical history, decides
to play his favorite song over the loudspeakers in the barn.  Your task is
to identify all the ruminant seventh chords in this song, to estimate how
sick it will make the cows.

The song played by FJ is a series of N (1 <= N <= 20,000) notes, each an
integer in the range 1..88.  A ruminant seventh chord is specified by a
sequence of C (1 <= C <= 10) distinct notes, also integers in the range
1..88.  However, even if these notes are transposed (increased or decreased
by a common amount), or re-ordered, the chord remains a ruminant seventh
chord!  For example, if "4 6 7" is a ruminant seventh chord, then "3 5 6"
(transposed by -1), "6 8 9" (transposed by +2), "6 4 7" (re-ordered), and
"5 3 6" (transposed and re-ordered) are also ruminant seventh chords.

A ruminant seventh chord is a sequence of C consecutive notes satisfying
the above criteria. It is therefore uniquely determined by its starting
location in the song. Please determine the indices of the starting
locations of all of the ruminant seventh chords.

PROBLEM NAME: moosick

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N.

* Lines 2..1+N: The N notes in FJ's song, one note per line.

* Line 2+N: A single integer: C.

* Lines 3+N..2+N+C: The C notes in an example of a ruminant seventh
        chord.  All transpositions and/or re-orderings of these notes
        are also ruminant seventh chords.

SAMPLE INPUT:

6
1
8
5
7
9
10
3
4
6
7

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ's song is 1,8,5,7,9,10.  A ruminant seventh chord is some
transposition/re-ordering of 4,6,7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A count, K, of the number of ruminant seventh chords that
        appear in FJ's song.  Observe that different instances of
        ruminant seventh chords can overlap each-other.

* Lines 2..1+K: Each line specifies the starting index of a ruminant
        seventh chord (index 1 is the first note in FJ's song, index N
        is the last).  Indices should be listed in increasing sorted
        order.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2
2
4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Two ruminant seventh chords appear in FJ's song (and these occurrences
actually overlap by one note).  The first is 8,5,7 (transposed by +1 and
reordered) starting at index 2, and the second is 7,9,10 (transposed by +3)
starting at index 4.

**Solving the "moosick" problem**

I need to tackle the "moosick" problem involving a song with N notes (1 to 88) and a chord example with C distinct notes (1 to 10). The goal is to find starting
 indices where the subsequence matches the chord in a transposed or reordered format. This means their notes must form the same multiset, so I’ll sort the chord
 and compute the differences relative to its minimum. While the chord has distinct notes, subsequences can contain duplicates. I need a thorough verification pr
ocess for this.
**Planning the "moosick" solution**

I’m mapping out a solution for the "moosick" problem. For every index \(i\) from 0 to \(N-C\), I’ll examine the subsequence \(song[i..i+C-1]\) and sort it, whic
h is efficient given \(C\) is small. I’ll create a vector of differences to compare against the chord's sorted differences. I can expect a complexity of \(O(N \
times (C \log C))\). My steps include reading input, processing the chord, and iterating through the song to find matches. Finally, I’ll write the solution into
 a file.
**Preparing the patch for solution.py**

I’m working on creating a patch based on the specification. The patch will include the command to apply changes to a file named `solution.py`. This file contain
s code for reading input, processing a song and chord, and checking for matches. The code includes necessary steps like sorting and calculating differences. At
the end of the patch, I want to ensure there's a newline for proper formatting. After I finalize this, I'll execute the command and confirm that the solution ha
s been saved successfully.

Here’s the completed solution:

- **Restatement**: Find every position in the song where a contiguous block of C notes is a transposed and/or reordered version of the given chord.
- **Concept**: Normalize the chord by sorting and shifting it so its smallest note is zero. For each window of length C in the song, sort and normalize likewise
, then compare these normalized note-patterns.
- **Pseudocode**:
  1. Read N and the song notes.
  2. Read C and the example chord.
  3. Sort chord; subtract its minimum to form `chord_diff`.
  4. For each start index i in song:
     - Extract window of length C.
     - Sort window; subtract its minimum to form `diff`.
     - If `diff == chord_diff`, record i+1.
  5. Print count and recorded positions.

The Python implementation is in `solution.py`. You can run it with `python3 solution.py` on your input. Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks or tests!
