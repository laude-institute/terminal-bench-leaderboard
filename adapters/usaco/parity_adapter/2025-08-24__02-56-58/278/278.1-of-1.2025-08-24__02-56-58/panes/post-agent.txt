 four feet start out in 4 adjacent cells forming a square as follows,
with Bessie facing north.

FL FR
RL RR

Bessie'"'"'s dance follows a series of N instructions (1 <= N <= 1000), where
each instruction tells her to either move one foot by one cell or to pivot
90 degrees clockwise.

Instructions to move a foot consist of 3 characters, the first two
identifying the foot to move, and the final character specifying the
direction of movement (F = forward, B = back, R = right, L = left).  For
example, "FRF" means Bessie should move her front right foot forward one
cell, and "RLR" means she should move her rear left foot right one cell.
Of course, the direction of movement is relative to the direction Bessie is
facing.

Instruction to pivot are also 3 characters, the first two specifying the
single foot that Bessie keeps planted, around which she rotates 90 degrees
clockwise.  The last character is "P" (for pivot).  For example, the
instruction "FRP" means Bessie should pivot 90 degrees clockwise about her
stationary front right foot.  This means that if her feet are currently
situated as follows (with Bessie facing north)

.. .. ..
.. .. FR
.. FL ..
.. RL RR

then the after the instruction "FRP" her feet will be located as follows,
with Bessie now facing east:

RL FL ..
RR .. FR
.. .. ..
.. .. ..

Given the N instructions in Bessie'"'"'s dance, please compute the minimum area
of a rectangular stage necessary contain her feet during the entire dance.

If Bessie clumsily ever moves one foot onto the same cell as another foot,
she will trip and fail to complete the dance; in this case, please output
-1.  Note that this is the only case where Bessie will trip; she has become
quite flexible after all her practice, and can easily move her feet into
rather strange configurations (for example, with her back feet farther
forward than her front feet).

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 1: Bovine Ballet [Brian Dean, 2013]

In an attempt to challenge the stereotypical perception of cows as awkward
creatures, Farmer John's prize cow Bessie has signed up for an introductory
ballet class.  Her final performance is next week, and FJ wants to help her
by building a rectangular stage large enough so that she can perform her
entire dance without falling off the edges.

Bessie's dance will take place on a rectangular stage consisting of a grid
of 1 x 1 square cells.  Bessie's four feet are described concisely as follows:

FR: Front right foot
FL: Front left foot
RR: Rear right foot
RL: Rear left foot

Her four feet start out in 4 adjacent cells forming a square as follows,
with Bessie facing north.

[2025-08-24T07:27:09] thinking

**Clarifying coordinates and movement**

I’m pondering directions and movement in a grid system, particularly relating to Bessie facing north. Usually, in a Cartesian coordinate system, y increases upw
ard, but I’m deciding to flip that so y increases downward instead. So, if Bessie is facing north, moving forward increases y by 1. I’m setting up a consistent
direction for movement: for example, forward (F), backward (B), right (R), and left (L) all correspond to specific vectors based on her facing direction.
**Implementing movement simulation**

I’m working on a movement simulation where I need to determine how Bessie moves based on her facing direction and commands. The key is to translate commands int
o movement vectors while pivoting around her feet positions. I'll track each foot's coordinates and update them as she moves or turns. I also need to consider c
ollisions and record the minimum and maximum x and y values for area calculation. After laying out the logic and pseudocode, I’ll create a solution file to impl
ement this.
**Planning code implementation**

I’m thinking about how to present the solution clearly. First, I’ll break down the reasoning in plain English, followed by the pseudocode to outline the logic.
Then, I’ll indicate that I’ll implement the code in a file named `solution.py`. It's important to have everything structured well into numbered sections so the
user can follow easily. After laying out the reasoning and pseudocode, I’ll save the solution through the appropriate process, ensuring it’s all organized prope
rly.

1. Problem Restatement
- Simulate Bessie’s four feet on a grid based on move and pivot instructions, track their positions, detect any collisions, and determine the minimal rectangle
area enclosing all foot positions over the entire dance.

2. Conceptual Solution
- Use Cartesian coordinates for each foot.
- Maintain Bessie’s facing direction (0=N,1=E,2=S,3=W).
- For each instruction:
  • If it’s a move (F/B/L/R), translate the specified foot by one unit in the relative direction.
  • If it’s a pivot (P), rotate the other three feet 90° clockwise around the pivot foot and update facing.
- After each step, check for any overlapping feet (collision → output -1).
- Record running min/max x and y across all steps.
- At the end, compute area = (max_x–min_x+1)×(max_y–min_y+1).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N and list of instructions
initialize foot positions: FL=(0,1), FR=(1,1), RL=(0,0), RR=(1,0)
facing = NORTH (0)
track min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y from initial positions

for each instruction:
    foot = first two chars
    cmd = third char
    if cmd == 'P':
        pivot around pos[foot]:
            for each other foot:
                compute dx,dy from pivot
                rotate: (dx,dy)->(dy,-dx)
                set new position
        facing = (facing+1)%4
    else:
        determine move_dir based on facing and cmd (F/B/R/L)
        dx,dy = vector for move_dir
        pos[foot] += (dx,dy)

    if any two feet share the same position:
        print(-1) and exit

    update min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y with current positions

compute width = max_x-min_x+1, height = max_y-min_y+1
print(width*height)
```

4. Implementation
A `solution.py` file has been created in the workspace with the complete implementation. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt
