[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In his spare time, Farmer John has created a new video-sharing service, which he
names MooTube.  On MooTube, Farmer John's cows can record, share, and discover
many amusing videos.  His cows already have posted $N$ videos
($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$.  However, FJ can't
quite figure out how to help his cows find new videos they might like.

FJ wants to create a list of "suggested videos" for every MooTube video.  This
way, cows will be recommended the videos most relevant to the ones they already
watch.

FJ devises a metric of "relevance," which determines, as the name suggests, how
relevant two videos are to each other.  He picks $N-1$ pairs of videos and
manually computes their pairwise relevance.  Then, FJ visualizes his videos as a
network, where each video is a node and the $N-1$ pairs of videos he manually
considered are connected.  Conveniently, FJ has picked his $N-1$ pairs so that
any video can be  reached from any other video along a path of connections in
exactly one way. FJ decides that the relevance of any pair of videos should be
defined as the minimum relevance of any connection along this path.

Farmer John wants to pick a value $K$ so that next to any given MooTube video,
all other videos with relevance at least $K$ to that video will be suggested.
However, FJ is worried that too many videos will be suggested to his cows, which
could distract them from milk production!  Therefore, he wants to carefully set
an appropriate value of $K$.  Farmer John would like your help answering a
number of questions about the suggested videos for certain values of $K$.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 100,000$).

The next $N-1$ lines each describe a pair of videos FJ manually compares.  Each
line includes three integers $p_i$, $q_i$, and $r_i$
($1 \leq p_i, q_i \leq N, 1 \leq r_i \leq 1,000,000,000$), indicating that
videos $p_i$ and $q_i$ are connected with relevance $r_i$.

The next $Q$ lines describe Farmer John's $Q$ questions.  Each line contains two
integers, $k_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq k_i \leq 1,000,000,000, 1 \leq v_i \leq N$),
indicating that FJ's $i$th question asks how many videos will be suggested to
viewers of video $v_i$ if $K = k_i$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output $Q$ lines.  On line $i$, output the answer to FJ's $i$th question.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
1 2 3
2 3 2
2 4 4
1 2
4 1
3 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3
0
2

Farmer John finds that videos one and two have relevance three, that videos two
and three have relevance two, and that videos two and four have relevance four.
Based on this, videos one and three have relevance min(3, 2) = 2, videos one and
four have relevance min(3, 4) = 3, and videos three and four have relevance
min(2, 4) = 2.

Farmer John wants to know how many videos will be suggested from video two if
$K=1$, from video one if $K=3$, and from video one if $K=4$.  We see that with
$K=1$, videos 1, 3, and 4 will be suggested on video two.  With $K=4$, no videos
will be suggested from video one.  With $K=3$, however, videos 2 and 4 will be
suggested from video one.

[2025-08-24T08:16:31] thinking

**Planning the solution**

I need to restate the problem and conceptualize a solution in plain English, then write some pseudocode, and finally create a solution in Python. The user didn’
t ask for testing, just the implementation file. Since the steps are fairly straightforward, I can structure my response to align with the user’s multi-part que
ry. I’ll focus on the following: restating the problem, explaining my conceptual solution, providing pseudocode, and creating the solution.py file. I'll ensure
it only uses essential libraries for input-output operations.
**Generating the solution patch**

I need to create an apply_patch to add the solution.py file containing the code. A key detail to remember is that the input uses 1-indexed nodes, so my DSU arra
y should be sized to N+1, and I need to subtract 1 from the answer. I'll ensure that queries are answered in the order they appear. To proceed, I’ll first resta
te the problem, then outline the conceptual solution, followed by pseudocode, and finally present the patch with the code properly structured.

1. Problem restatement
- We have \(N\) videos connected as a tree (each edge with a “relevance” weight).
- The relevance between any two videos is the minimum edge weight along their unique path.
- For each query \((K, v)\), count how many other videos have relevance \(\ge K\) to video \(v\).

2. Conceptual solution
- Sort all edges in descending order of their weights.
- Sort queries descending by \(K\).
- Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure that tracks component sizes.
- Sweep through queries: for each query threshold \(K\), union all edges with weight \(\ge K\). Every node in the same DSU component as \(v\) then has relevance
 \(\ge K\) to \(v\).
- Answer is the component size minus one (excluding \(v\) itself).

3. Pseudocode
```
read N, Q
edges = list of (r, p, q) for N-1 edges
queries = list of (k, v, index) for Q queries
sort edges by r descending
sort queries by k descending
init DSU parent[i]=i, size[i]=1
e_idx = 0
for each (k, v, qi) in sorted queries:
    while e_idx < len(edges) and edges[e_idx].r >= k:
        union(edges[e_idx].p, edges[e_idx].q)
        e_idx += 1
    ans[qi] = size[find(v)] - 1
output ans in original order
```

4. Implementation
The complete solution has been saved to `solution.py`. You can run it with:
```
python3 solution.py < input.txt > output.txt
```
