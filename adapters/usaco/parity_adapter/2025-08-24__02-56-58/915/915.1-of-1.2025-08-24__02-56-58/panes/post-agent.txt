Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.
Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English

4. Save your solution as solution.py
No outside libraries are allowed.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's 3 prize cows, Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, are always wandering off
to  the far reaches of the farm!  He needs your help herding them back together.

The main field in the farm is long and skinny -- we can think of it as a number
line, on which a cow can occupy any integer location.  The 3 cows are currently
situated at different integer locations, and Farmer John wants to move
them so they occupy three consecutive locations (e.g., positions 6, 7, and 8).

Unfortunately, the cows are rather sleepy, and Farmer John has trouble getting
their attention to make them move.  At any point in time, he can only make a cow
move if she is an "endpoint" (either the minimum or maximum position among all
the cows).  When he moves a cow, he can instruct her to move to any unoccupied
integer location as long as in this new location she is no longer an endpoint.
Observe that over time, these types of moves tend to push the cows closer and
closer together.

Please determine the minimum and maximum number of moves possible before the
cows become grouped in three consecutive locations.

INPUT FORMAT:
The input file contains one line with three space-separated integers, giving the
locations of Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred.  Each location is an integer in the
range $1 \ldots 10^9$.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line of output should contain the minimum number of moves Farmer John
needs to make to group the cows together.  The second line of output should
contain the maximum number of such moves he could conceivably make before the
cows become grouped together.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 7 9
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
2

The minimum number of moves is 1 --- if Farmer John moves the cow in position 4
to position 8, then the cows are at consecutive locations 7, 8, 9.  The maximum
number of  moves is 2.  For example, the cow at position 9 could be moved to
position 6, then the cow at position 7 could be moved to position 5.

**Breaking down herding problem**

The user is asking for a comprehensive approach to solving the "Herding" problem from USACO Bronze 2015, which involves minimal moves to align cows. The solutio
n involves checking special gap conditions between their positions. If cows are already consecutive, the answer is 0; if there's a gap of 2, one move is needed;
 otherwise, it takes two moves. For specific gaps, I can summarize: if gaps are both 1, the minimum is 0; if one gap is 2, then 1 move is needed; otherwise, 2 m
oves.

**Restatement**
Three cows stand at distinct integer positions on a number line. You may move only an endpoint cow (the leftmost or rightmost) to any unoccupied spot that’s no
longer an endpoint. Find the fewest and the most moves needed to make their positions three consecutive integers.

**Conceptual Solution**
- Sort the three positions; call them `a < b < c`.
- The two gaps are `gap1 = b - a` and `gap2 = c - b`.
- Minimum moves:
  - If already consecutive (`gap1 == 1` and `gap2 == 1`), zero moves.
  - Else if there’s exactly one empty spot adjacent (one gap equals 2), one move.
  - Otherwise, two moves.
- Maximum moves:
  - Each move can shrink the larger gap by at most 1, so the maximum is `max(gap1, gap2) - 1`.

**Pseudocode**
```
read three integers into list positions
sort positions into a, b, c
gap1 = b - a
gap2 = c - b

if gap1 == 1 and gap2 == 1:
    min_moves = 0
elif gap1 == 2 or gap2 == 2:
    min_moves = 1
else:
    min_moves = 2

max_moves = max(gap1, gap2) - 1

print min_moves
print max_moves
```

I’ve saved the complete implementation as `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like me to run any tests!
