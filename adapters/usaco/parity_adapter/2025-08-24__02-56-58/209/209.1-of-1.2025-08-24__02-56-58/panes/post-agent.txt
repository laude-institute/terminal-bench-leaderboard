[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Problem 2: Wifi Setup [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 2000) are all standing at various positions
along the straight path from the barn to the pasture, which we can think of
as a one-dimensional number line.  Since his cows like to stay in email
contact with each-other, FJ wants to install Wifi base stations at various
positions so that all of the cows have wireless coverage.

After shopping around, FJ learns that the cost of a Wifi base station
depends on distance it can transmit: a base station of power r costs A +
B*r, where A is a fixed cost for installing the base station and B is a
cost per unit of transmission distance.  If FJ installs such a device at
position x, then it can transmit data to any cow located in the range x-r
... x+r.  A base station with transmission power of r=0 is allowed, but
this only provides coverage to a cow located at the same position as the
transmitter.

Given the values of A and B, as well as the locations of FJ's cows, please
determine the least expensive way FJ can provide wireless coverage for all
his cows.

PROBLEM NAME: wifi

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N A B (0 <= A, B <= 1000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains an integer in the range
        0..1,000,000 describing the location of one of FJ's cows.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 20 5
7
0
100

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 3 cows at positions 7, 0, and 100.  Installation of a base
station of power r costs 20 + 5*r.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum cost of providing wireless coverage to all cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

57.5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The optimal solution is to build a base station at position 3.5 (with power
3.5) and another at position 100 (with power 0).  The first base station
covers cows 1 and 2, and the second covers cow 3.

**Developing a Python solution**

The user needs a Python 3 solution without specific time limits, but with N up to 2000, I've noted the problem involves choosing K base stations to cover sorted
 cow positions while minimizing costs. Since each station covers a range and costs increase linearly with radius, it’s best to cover adjacent cows with one stat
ion. I’ll use dynamic programming, where I define the minimum cost to cover the first i cows and evaluate covering cows j to i. The radius calculation is needed
 next.
**Calculating costs in dynamic programming**

I’m setting up a dynamic programming solution. My formula states that DP[i] is the minimum cost by considering all previous positions up to i. Sorting the posit
ions and precomputing might help, yielding a complexity of O(N^2), which is fine for N up to 2000. I’ve noted costs can be fractional, resulting in floating-poi
nt values.

To avoid potential tiny float errors, I might format the output to ensure precision. The plan includes reading inputs, sorting positions, and running the DP alg
orithm accurately, considering costs based on radius calculations. I’ll print the final cost, maintaining consistent formatting.
**Formatting output and structuring the solution**

I’m thinking about how to format the output based on the computed costs from dynamic programming. If the result is an integer, I may prefer it without a decimal
, but there are nuances to consider with the cost potentially being fractional. The specifications aren’t entirely clear, so I’ll output as a float when needed.

Next, I realize I need to follow a structured approach to provide the user with a comprehensive solution. This includes restating the problem, explaining my sol
ution concept, writing pseudocode, and then saving the implementation in a Python file named solution.py, ensuring it's clear and organized throughout.
**Preparing the solution patch**

I'm assessing the efficiency, which is O(N^2) at most 4 million iterations, and Python can handle that load. Since the task is straightforward, I won’t need to
plan a complex approach. I’m ready to write the final message, organizing it into four sections, and then apply my patch to create the solution file named solut
ion.py. I'll proceed with that, ensuring everything is clear and concise for the user.

**Restatement**
We have N cows located on a line. Each Wifi station costs A + B·r to install with transmission radius r, and covers all cows within [x–r, x+r]. We need to cover
 every cow at minimum total cost.

**Solution Outline**
- Sort cow positions.
- Use DP where dp[i] = minimum cost to cover the first i cows.
- For each i, consider the last station covering cows j…i. The optimal placement is at their midpoint with radius (x_i–x_j)/2, costing A + B·((x_i–x_j)/2).
- dp[i] = min over j≤i of dp[j–1] + A + B·((x_i–x_j)/2).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N, A, B
read positions xs; sort xs
dp[0] = 0; dp[1…N] = inf
for i in 1…N:
    for j in 1…i:
        r = (xs[i-1] - xs[j-1]) / 2
        cost = A + B*r
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + cost)
res = dp[N]
if res is integer or .5, format accordingly
print res
```

I’ve saved this solution in `solution.py`. Let me know if you’d like any tests or further adjustments!
