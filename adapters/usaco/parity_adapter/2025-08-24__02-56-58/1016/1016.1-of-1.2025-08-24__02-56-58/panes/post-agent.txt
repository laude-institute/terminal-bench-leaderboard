Please implement a Python 3 solution to the below problem.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Farmer John's new barn has a truly strange design: it consists of $N$ rooms
($2 \leq N \leq 2500$), conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$, and $N-1$ corridors.
Each corridor connects a pair of rooms, in such a way that it is possible to
walk from any room to any other room along a series of corridors.

Every room in the barn has a circular clock on the wall with the standard
integers $1 \ldots 12$ around its face. However, these clocks only have one
hand, which always points directly at one of the integers on the clock face (it
never points between two of these integers).

Bessie the cow wants to synchronize all the clocks in the barn so they all point
to the integer 12.  However, she is somewhat simple-minded, and as she walks
around the barn, every time she enters a room, she moves the hand on its clock
ahead by one position. For example, if the clock pointed at 5, it would now
point at 6, and if the clock pointed at 12, it would now point at 1.  If Bessie
enters the same room multiple times, she advances the clock in that room every
time she enters.

Please determine the number of rooms in which Bessie could start walking around
the barn such that she could conceivably set all the clocks to point to 12.
Note that Bessie does not initially advance the clock in her starting room, but
she would advance the clock in that room any time she re-entered it.  Clocks do
not advance on their own; a clock only advances if Bessie enters its room.
Furthermore, once Bessie enters a corridor she must exit through the other end
(it is not allowed to walk partially through the corridor and loop back around
to the same room).

SCORING:
Test cases 2-7 satisfy $N\le 100$.Test cases 8-15 satisfy no additional constraints.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains $N$.  The next line contains $N$ integers, each
in the range $1 \ldots 12$, specifying the initial clock setting in each room.
The next $N-1$ lines each describe a corridor in terms of two integers $a$ and
$b$, each in the range $1 \ldots N$, giving the room numbers connected by the
corridor.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the number of rooms in which Bessie could start, such that it is possible
for her to set all clocks to point to 12.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
11 10 11 11
1 2
2 3
2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

In this example, Bessie can set all the clocks to point to 12 if and only if she starts
in room 2 (for example, by moving to room 1, 2, 3, 2, and finally 4).

[2025-08-24T07:12:20] thinking

**Structuring a Python solution**

I'm thinking through the user's request to implement a solution in Python 3. First, I need to rephrase the problem: we're dealing with a tree of up to 2500 node
s, each with a clock value from 1 to 12. The goal is to find how many starting rooms allow for a walk that achieves all clock values of 12.

Next, I conceptualize it as a "Clock Tree" problem from USACO. The solution involves examining parity; thus, I'll outline pseudocode that does a DFS to compute
the sums of clocks at even and odd depths. Lastly, I’ll save the final implementation as solution.py.
**Conceptualizing a bipartite solution**

I'm breaking down the task of implementing a solution using a bipartite coloring approach through BFS. The idea is to compute two sums (sum0 and sum1) based on
color. If the difference \(D\) is either 0, 1, or 11, we can directly produce responses based on those conditions.

In plain English, we color the tree, sum the clock values, and use mod 12 for calculation. I’ll handle the clock values carefully, interpreting 12 as 0. The nex
t steps involve restating the problem, conceptualizing, providing pseudocode, and finally saving the implementation as solution.py.

**Restatement**
- We have an N-node tree where each node has a clock showing 1–12.
- Entering a room increments its clock by 1 (mod 12). The starting room is not advanced initially.
- Find how many choices of starting room allow us (by walking edges back and forth) to make all clocks read 12.

**Conceptual Solution**
- A tree is bipartite: color rooms 0 or 1 by depth parity.
- Map clock values so 12→0, others→value mod 12.
- Let sum₀ = total on color 0, sum₁ = total on color 1 (mod 12). Compute D = (sum₀ – sum₁) mod 12.
- Known result:
  - If D==0, any start works (answer = N).
  - If D==1, only starts on color 0 work (answer = count₀).
  - If D==11 (i.e. –1 mod 12), only starts on color 1 work (answer = count₁).
  - Otherwise, no start works (answer = 0).

**Pseudocode**
```
read N
read clocks[1..N]; map each to value % 12
build adjacency list for N nodes
bipartite-color the tree into color[0..N-1]
sum_vals[0], sum_vals[1] ← totals of clocks by color
count[0], count[1] ← node counts by color
D ← (sum_vals[0] - sum_vals[1]) mod 12
if D == 0: result = N
elif D == 1: result = count[0]
elif D == 11: result = count[1]
else: result = 0
print(result)
```
