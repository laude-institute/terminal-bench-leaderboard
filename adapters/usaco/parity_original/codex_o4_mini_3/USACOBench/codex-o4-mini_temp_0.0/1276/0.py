1. Restatement:
   There are N cows each occupying a disjoint interval of stalls [s_i, t_i] with a required cooling c_i.
   There are M air conditioners, each covering an interval [a_j, b_j] and providing p_j cooling at cost m_j.
   Choose a subset of air conditioners with minimum total cost so that for every stall occupied by each cow,
   the combined cooling from selected air conditioners is at least c_i.

2. Conceptual Solution:
   Since M <= 10, we can enumerate all subsets of air conditioners (up to 2^10 = 1024).
   For each subset, compute the cooling at each stall (1..100) by summing p_j for selected conditioners.
   Then check each cowâ€™s occupied stalls to ensure the cooling at every stall in its range >= c_i.
   Track the minimum cost among all feasible subsets.

3. Pseudocode:
   read N, M
   read cows: list of (s_i, t_i, c_i)
   read ACs: list of (a_j, b_j, p_j, m_j)
   ans = infinity
   for each mask in 0..(1<<M)-1:
       cost = sum of m_j for j where mask bit j is set
       if cost >= ans: continue
       cooling = array[1..100] initialized to 0
       for each j in 0..M-1:
           if mask has bit j:
               for x in a_j..b_j: cooling[x] += p_j
       valid = true
       for each cow (s_i, t_i, c_i):
           for x in s_i..t_i:
               if cooling[x] < c_i:
                   valid = false; break
           if not valid: break
