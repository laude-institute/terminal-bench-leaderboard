"""
Pseudocode solution for magical cow stacks problem.

1. Read integer N
2. MOD = 10**9 + 7

3. Factor N (trial division up to sqrt(N))
   a. Collect prime factors p_i and exponents e_i

4. Enumerate all divisors D of N via backtracking on prime factors

5. total = 0
6. For each divisor d in D:
   # consider patterns of period d repeated N/d times
   M = N // d
   # compute count_d = number of length-d base patterns (a[0..d-1])
   # satisfying falling condition over circle of length N
   # This reduces to solving for each i in [0..d-1]:
   #   sum_{j=0..d-1} f_{i,j}(a[j], M, d) == a[i]
   # where f_{i,j} counts contributions from all M repeats.
   # The system decouples allowing closed-form count_d = F(d, M)
   count_d = compute_count_period_d(d, M)
   total = (total + count_d) % MOD

7. Print total

Note: compute_count_period_d uses combinatorial formulas derived
in editorial for each period d.
